This is Tiger from CICC ECM and I would like to start with few things that has happened recently.\nFirst, after the deal team filed the main board listing on May 19 last Friday, we have taken several steps immediately. Over the weekend, we have gone through the list of existing strategic investors , and conducted 1on1 communication with each of them to update them the current project status. We have shared the new Main board prospectus, the IPO timeline with each of them and we standby 24x7 with the goal to secure their indicated investments.\nSecond, this week, we hosted a company wide sales teachin with all equity sales teams to update the project status and leverage our sales network to explore new strategic investors. The focus would be SOEs, mutual funds, insurance companies and QFII investors with strong financial capabilities.\nAnd so far, the feedback we have received are mainly two parts. \nThe first question we constantly get is related to our choice of STAR board IPO initially. We explained to clients that back in 2021 before the full registration-based IPO system rolls out, STAR Board was the market that accepts a variety of valuation methods and appreciate companies with advanced technology. Now, since the main board has also adopted the registration-based IPO system, it becomes a more suitable market for us because of better liquidity and the demonstrated capability to host large size IPO\u2019s like us.\nThe other question we get from clients is related to our 2023 financial performance and the 3 year growth forecast. \nNext Xuying will elaborate on the details of our adapted sales marketing strategy.

My name is Tiger, and I'm from CICC ECM. First and foremost, I'd like to discuss a few recent developments. Following the filing of the main board listing on May 19th, we've immediately taken several steps. Over the weekend, we communicated with existing strategic investors one-on-one, keeping them updated on the project status, sharing the new Main board prospectus and IPO timeline, and ensuring their investment confirmation. We remain available 24/7 to provide any necessary support.\n\nSecondly, we hosted a company-wide sales meeting this week, with a focus on updating our sales network on the project's status and exploring new strategic investors. Specifically, the focus is on SOEs, mutual funds, insurance companies, and QFII investors with strong financial capabilities.\n\nSo far, we've received mainly two types of feedback from clients. The first is related to our choice of STAR board IPO initially. We explained the reasoning behind our decision and how the main board's registration-based IPO system makes it a more suitable market due to its better liquidity and track record of hosting large IPOs like ours. \n\nThe second question clients are asking us is related to our 2023 financial performance and three-year growth forecast.

Adler (Author), George Rodman (Author), Athena du Pr\u00e9 (Author): Throughout my life, I have encountered several cultural and co-cultural differences in nonverbal behaviors. To illustrate these differences, I will focus on body language and spatial use.\n\nBody Language: Eye Contact, Facial Expression, Gesture, Posture and Body Orientation, and Touch\n\nGrowing up in Kosovo, I observed a variety of norms surrounding body language that differed from other (co)cultures. In the Balkans, maintaining consistent eye contact during a conversation is considered crucial. It indicates respect and attentiveness. When I first encountered Westerners, I noticed that they were often uncomfortable with the intensity and frequency of the eye contact, which led to misunderstandings early on. When I learned about these differences, I tried to change my behavior so that it is more acceptable for their cultural expectations.\n\nIn addition to eye contact, facial expressions and gestures also play a significant role in nonverbal communication. For example, in the Balkans, it is common to use expressive facial gestures and hand movements to emphasize points during conversations. This level of expressiveness can be perceived as overly emotional or aggressive by individuals from cultures that prioritize restraint in their nonverbal behavior, like the Japanese.\n\nFurthermore, touch is a crucial aspect of nonverbal communication in the Balkans. Hugging, cheek kissing, and close physical proximity are all standard practices to show appreciation and friendliness. When meeting a person for the first time or in more formal situations the norm is a firm handshake and steady eye contact. However, I have noticed that these practices are not as common in Western countries, where physical contact, except for handshakes, may be more limited, especially in professional or formal settings.\n\nSpatial Use: Personal Space, Acoustic Space, Territory, and Artifacts\n\nThe concept of personal space is culturally and co-culturally dependent. In Kosovo, people tend to have a smaller sphere of personal space compared to their Western counterparts, as is common in many collectivist cultures. This closeness in physical proximity can lead to uncomfortable experiences for individuals from cultures that prioritize larger spheres of personal space.\n\nAcoustic space refers to how individuals use their voices in a shared environment. In the Balkans, people may be more likely to speak loudly or animatedly in public spaces without reservation, whereas in countries like Japan, quiet public spaces like public transportation or libraries would require individuals to speak softly out of respect for others. This style of communication can sometimes inadvertently come across as intrusive or rude to the people that are not used to it.\n\nTerritory refers to the space we claim for ourselves, and in the Balkans, it is common to see friends and family members gather and socialize in public spaces such as parks or town squares. In places that value privacy and personal space-like the United States, many people might find this behavior intrusive, as they would prefer to socialize in private spaces such as homes or reserved locations.\n\nIn conclusion, culture and co-culture play a significant role in shaping our nonverbal behaviors. I have encountered different expectations and preferences in communication which have led to misunderstandings or misinterpretations. It is crucial to educate ourselves about these differences and to foster respect and understanding across (co)cultural divides. Moreover, by referencing the terminology concepts and content from \u201cUnderstanding Human Communication fourth edition\u201d, we can better understand and navigate these differences in our daily lives. Nonverbal categories such as body language and spatial use illustrate the varying expectations between different (co)cultures, allowing us to become more empathetic and adaptable communicators.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Throughout my life, I have come across numerous cultural and co-cultural differences in nonverbal communication methods that align with the concepts described in chapters 5 and 7 of the book Understanding Human Communication 14th Edition by Ronald B. Adler (Author), George Rodman (Author), Athena du Pr\u00e9 (Author). Specifically, I will focus on body language and spatial use as they showcase several differences in expectations and preferences in communication styles.\n\nBody language is a crucial aspect of nonverbal communication that comprises eye contact, facial expression, gesture, posture and body orientation, and touch. Growing up in Kosovo, I was accustomed to making consistent eye contact during a conversation, which indicated respect and attentiveness, a norm that contrasted with other (co)cultures.\u00a0This observation is aligned with the concept discussed in chapter 5 that discusses how eye contact represents a sign of open-mindedness, influence, credibility, and interest. Furthermore, expressive facial gestures, hand movements, and touch are common in Balkan culture, but these same behavior patterns are interpreted differently in other cultures, such as the Japanese culture, where restraint and subtlety is favoured. As discussed in chapter 7, the understanding of these distinct varieties plays an essential role in intercultural communication.\n\nSpatial use is another crucial nonverbal consideration that affects communication interactions. It comprises personal space, acoustic space, territory, and artifacts. As mentioned earlier, personal space is culturally dependent, with Kosovo having smaller personal space compared to their Western counterparts. The concept of acoustic space is also crucial. In Kosovo, people tend to speak loudly or animatedly, but in countries such as Japan, people tend to speak softly and politely. The contrast creates misinterpretation of nonverbal communication, as discussed in chapter 5. Also, territory often influences nonverbal communication. Gathering in public spaces like parks and town squares is common in Balkan culture, a norm that sometimes contradicts that found in cultures that encourage privacy and personal space, like the United States, as emphasized in chapter 7.\n\nIn summary, culture and co-culture play a significant role in determining nonverbal communication behavior patterns. The understanding of these differences in communication style such as body language and spatial use can contribute to building respect and understanding across cultural divides. Additionally, utilizing the terminology concepts and content in the book Understanding Human Communication fourth edition can aid in navigating these cultural differences effectively in our daily lives."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.059612526820690376 0.9324967085277198"}, {"role": "user", "content": "can you add these concepts where relevant in the text above: affect blend p. 167\naffect displays p. 160\nchronemics p. 173\ndeception bias p. 165\ndisfluencies p. 168\nemblems p. 161\nexpectancy violation theory p. 160\nhaptics p. 171\nillustrators p. 163\nintimate distance p. 172\nkinesics p. 166\nmanipulators p. 166\nmonochronic p. 174\nnonverbal communication p. 156\nparalanguage p. 168\npersonal distance p. 172\npolychronic p. 174\nproxemics p. 171\npublic distance p. 172\nsocial distance p. 172\nterritoriality p. 173\ntruth bias p. 165"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Throughout my life, I have come across numerous cultural and co-cultural differences in nonverbal communication methods that align with the concepts described in the book \"Understanding Human Communication 14th Edition\" by Ronald B.

Specifically, I will focus on body language and spatial use as they showcase several differences in expectations and preferences in communication styles.\n\nBody language is a crucial aspect of nonverbal communication, comprising affect displays, affect blend, emblems, illustrators, kinesics, manipulators, and paralanguage. Growing up in Kosovo, I was accustomed to using expressive facial gestures and hand movements, which served as illustrators and emblems, to emphasize my points in conversations. However, these same behavior patterns are perceived differently in other cultures, such as the Japanese, who prioritize restraint and subtlety in their nonverbal behavior. Furthermore, deception bias and truth bias also play a crucial role. The people we communicate with often form expectations based on their assumptions about our truthfulness or deception as emphasized in chapter 5. Awareness of these biases can help us avoid stereotypes and improve mutual understanding.\n\nSpatial use is another essential nonverbal consideration that affects communication interactions, such as proxemics, territoriality, chronemics, polychronic, and monochronic. The concept of personal space is culturally dependent, with Kosovo having a smaller personal space compared to their Western counterparts. This observation is consistent with the concept of proxemics, which describes the study of spatial relations between individuals and varied cultural expectations. In Kosovo, haptics is crucial, and physical touch, such as hugging, is common practice to show appreciation and friendliness, serving as an affect display. In addition, chronemics affect communication interactions, with polychronic cultures having flexible schedules, while monochronic cultures value punctuality, as emphasized in chapter 7.\n\nIn conclusion, culture and co-culture play a significant role in determining nonverbal communication behavior patterns. The understanding of these differences in communication style such as affect displays, proxemics, and chronemics can contribute to building respect and understanding across cultural divides.

While GPT-3 is not an AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) and is limited to specific domains, it demonstrated significant advancements in natural language understanding and generation.\n\nThe purpose of GPT-3, or any language model for that matter, is to enhance language processing capabilities and facilitate various applications in areas like content creation, customer service, tutoring, translation, and more. While AGI refers to highly autonomous systems that perform a broad range of intellectual tasks at or beyond human capabilities, models like GPT-3 are mainly focused on language processing tasks.\n\nThe introduction of models like GPT-3 is a step towards advancing AI capabilities and understanding how large-scale language models can be utilized effectively.

For example, during the Akkadian Empire (around 23rd century BCE), the king Naram-Sin referred to his campaigns reaching the \"Land of Magan,\" which likely indicates his military activities in the eastern Mediterranean region, including Egypt.\n\nThe ancient Mesopotamians also had cultural exchanges with Egypt. For instance, there are records of trade between the two regions, including the exchange of goods like textiles, precious metals, and timber. Moreover, during the Old Babylonian period, the Babylonian king Hammurabi created a law code, and some legal principles in his code bear similarities to those found in the earlier Egyptian legal system.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that the information that has survived from ancient Mesopotamian texts is relatively fragmentary, and our understanding of their perceptions and interactions with Egypt is limited.

These texts depict the Sumerian gods and goddesses as beings with human-like personalities, emotions, and powers. The gods were associated with natural elements, celestial bodies, and various aspects of life, such as fertility, war, wisdom, and craftsmanship.\n\nThe Sumerians believed that the gods controlled various aspects of the world and they sought to appease and honor them through rituals, offerings, and prayers. They built elaborate temples called ziggurats to serve as sacred spaces for worship and performed rituals led by priests to ensure the favor of the deities. The city of Nippur, with its temple dedicated to the god Enlil, was particularly significant as it was considered the religious center of Sumer.\n\nIt is important to note that Mesopotamian beliefs and the gods they worshiped evolved and changed over time with the rise and fall of different empires and the influence of neighboring cultures.

Food not only provides us with the necessary nutrients and energy required for the proper functioning of our body but also has a cultural and social significance. In this article, we will explore the different aspects of food, including its history, types, and role in modern society.\n\nHistory of food\n\nFood has been a crucial part of human existence since the beginning of time. The earliest human civilizations were hunters and gatherers who relied heavily on foraging for their food. However, as time passed, people started to domesticate plants and animals, leading to the rise of agriculture and animal husbandry.\n\nThe history of food is closely intertwined with the history of human evolution, and the food that our ancestors ate has played a crucial role in shaping our dietary preferences. For instance, the modern-day human palate is attuned to sweet, salty, and fatty foods because our ancestors needed these flavors to survive in nature.\n\nTypes of food\n\nThere are different types of food, and they can be classified based on their nutritional value, method of preparation, and cultural significance. Some of the major types of food are:\n\n1. Whole foods - these are foods that are minimally processed and retain all their natural vitamins and minerals. Examples are fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.\n\n2. Processed foods - these are foods that have been altered in some way to make them more palatable or convenient to eat. Examples are canned foods, frozen foods, and snacks.\n\n3. Fast food - these are foods that are designed to be consumed quickly, often on the go. Examples are burgers, fries, and sandwiches.\n\n4. Ethnic food - these are foods that are unique to a specific culture or region. Examples are Chinese cuisine, Indian cuisine, and Italian cuisine.\n\nRole in modern society\n\nFood has significant cultural, social, and economic implications in modern society. In many cultures, food is an integral part of social gatherings, celebrations, and religious ceremonies. Food is also an essential component of the hospitality industry, which includes restaurants, hotels, and catering services.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing awareness of the impact of food on the environment and health. Many people are turning to plant-based diets to reduce their carbon footprint and improve their health. The organic food movement is gaining momentum, as people seek foods that are free from synthetic chemicals and pesticides.\n\nIn conclusion, food is not just an essential part of our existence, but it also plays a vital role in shaping our culture, traditions, and economy. As we move forward, it is crucial to make informed choices about the food that we consume, and its impact on our health, environment, and society."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.009678578177263034 0.9872417547343345"}]}, {"facetValue": "explain the first chapter of David Copperfield sentence by sentence.

These trains are powered by electricity and are primarily used for commuter and regional passenger services. EMUs are designed to be self-sufficient, with each carriage having its own traction motors and being capable of independent movement in case of a failure of another carriage in the same unit. This design provides redundancy and increases overall reliability.\n\nEMUs can be classified according to their electrical supply system, including overhead lines, third rail, or both. The operation of EMUs began in the early 20th century, with the introduction of the London Underground's City and South London Railway. The early EMUs were typically restricted to suburban and commuter services due to their limited range but saw significant expansion in the post-World War II period as electrification increased across the UK rail network.\n\nOver the years, EMUs have evolved, both in terms of technological advancements and design. Many different EMU classes have been developed and utilized, some notable ones being the British Rail Class 302, Class 305, Class 313, and Class 315, among many others. Modern EMUs now incorporate advanced features such as regenerative braking and computerized control systems.\n\nIn recent years, due to environmental concerns and the need for more energy-efficient vehicles, the focus has been on further electrification of the rail network in the UK. As a result, the importance of EMUs has increased, and modern EMU designs emphasize energy efficiency, accessibility, and comfort for passengers. Newer EMU fleets taking the spotlight include the Class 700, Class 800, and Class 345, which are now being introduced in various rail operations across the country."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.00965073383827011 0.9844015111055128"}]}, {"facetValue": "rewrite a product review they provided.

The book explores various aspects of body language, such as posture, gestures, facial expressions, eye movements, and voice tone.\n\nOne of the key insights in the book is that body language often speaks louder than words. For instance, if someone is crossing their arms during a conversation, it could indicate that they are defensive, closed off, or uninterested in what's being said. Similarly, if someone is leaning forward and making eye contact, it could indicate that they are engaged, interested, and invested in the conversation.\n\nAnother important concept in the book is that body language is culturally conditioned. Different cultures may have different norms around eye contact, physical touch, and other nonverbal cues. As such, it's important to be aware of cultural differences and to adapt one's nonverbal communication accordingly.\n\nThe book also delves into the different ways that men and women tend to communicate nonverbally. For instance, men may use more expansive gestures and stand with their feet apart to assert their dominance, while women may use more subtle cues like tilting their head or crossing their legs to convey their interest or disinterest.\n\nOverall, \"The Definitive Book of Body Language\" is a fascinating read that can help readers become more aware of the nonverbal cues they and others are sending in daily communication.

Please keep in mind that these tips are by no means foolproof and seeking professional assistance from law enforcement and security experts is crucial in such situations.\n\n1. Stay Calm: It's important to remain calm and composed. Panic can cloud your judgment, so take deep breaths to help manage your anxiety.\n\n2. Assess the Situation: Try to gather as much information as possible about your surroundings, captors, and potential escape routes. This will assist you in making informed decisions.\n\n3. Establish Rapport: Build a rapport with your captors, if possible. Show empathy and listen actively. This might create an opportunity for you to negotiate or establish some form of understanding, increasing your chances of survival.\n\n4. Look for Weaknesses: Observe your captors for any weaknesses or vulnerabilities that could be exploited. This might include inattentiveness or distractions that might allow you to escape or seek help.\n\n5. Avoid Drawing Attention: If communication is allowed, be careful about revealing your plans or intentions. Your captors may scrutinize your conversations or actions, so it's important to stay discreet.\n\n6. Seek Opportunities for Escape: Assess the situation and surroundings for potential escape opportunities. This might include when you are moved to a different location or if your captors become less vigilant.\n\n7. Memorize Details: Pay attention to details such as locations, captor appearances, and sounds. This information may be crucial for law enforcement during an investigation.\n\n8. Focus on Survival Skills: If your captivity extends for a longer duration, prioritize acquiring knowledge and skills that can assist in survival, such as basic first aid, self-defense techniques, and mental resilience strategies.\n\n9. Plan for Aftermath: Think about your strategy after potential escape. Identify safe places to seek immediate help, trusted contacts to reach out to, and authorities to report to once you are free.\n\nRemember, survival in a kidnapping situation is highly dependent on the specific circumstances. These tips are general guidelines and seeking professional help should be your priority. Reach out to local law enforcement or security agencies for more specific guidance tailored to your situation.

Stay Informed: Pay attention to reliable news sources, social media updates from local authorities or reputable organizations. Stay informed about the areas affected, potential threats, and developments in the situation.\n\n2. Create an Emergency Plan: Develop a comprehensive emergency plan for yourself and your family. Identify safe meeting points, establish communication protocols, and determine multiple evacuation routes if needed.\n\n3. Avoid Hotspots: Steer clear of areas experiencing the highest levels of unrest. Monitor the situation and adjust your movements accordingly. If protests or demonstrations are planned, avoid those areas to reduce the risk of getting caught up in violence or property damage.\n\n4. Maintain Situational Awareness: Constantly assess your surroundings and remain alert to any signs of escalating tension or violence. Trust your instincts and be ready to adapt your plans if the situation deteriorates.\n\n5. Secure Your Home: Ensure your residence is adequately secure by locking doors and windows. Consider reinforcing entry points, installing security systems, and having emergency supplies readily available.\n\n6. Stock Essential Supplies: Maintain a stock of essential supplies, including water, non-perishable food, medications, and first aid kits. In case of disruptions to services or extended periods of unrest, these supplies will be crucial.\n\n7. Stay Connected: Keep your mobile devices charged and have backup power sources available. Establish contact with loved ones and check on their well-being. Having a way to communicate and stay connected is important during civil unrest.\n\n8. Blend In: If you must be in public areas during civil unrest, try to blend in and avoid drawing unwanted attention. Dress in neutral clothing, avoid wearing anything that may identify you as a target or supporter of a particular group.\n\n9. Be Prepared to Shelter in Place: In certain situations, it may be safer to stay indoors than to venture out. Be prepared to shelter in place for extended periods. Have necessary supplies, including food, water, and protection, to sustain yourself until it is safe to move.\n\n10. Stay Non-Confrontational: Avoid engaging in confrontations or political discussions that may escalate tensions. It's important to prioritize your safety and that of those around you.\n\nRemember, every civil unrest situation is unique, and these tips provide general guidance.

Here are some general considerations for selecting a hiding spot:\n\n1. Secure Room: Identify a room that can be locked or barricaded, preferably with a solid door, minimal windows, and without obvious signs of occupancy from the outside.\n\n2. Avoid Obvious Hiding Spots: Stay away from areas such as closets or under beds, which are often the first places intruders check.\n\n3. Multiple Exits: If possible, choose a room with multiple exits, such as a back door or window. This allows for alternate escape routes if the need arises.\n\n4. Locks and Barricades: Ensure that the doors to your hiding spot have sturdy locks. Consider reinforcing them with additional supports, such as door jammers or wedges, and using heavy furniture or objects to create a barricade against the door.\n\n5. Silence: Prioritize silence and minimize any noise that might give away your location. Turn off cell phones, radios, and any other devices that could make sound.\n\n6. Concealment: Find a spot where you're less likely to be seen. Hide behind large furniture, under a desk or table, or behind curtains or drapes that provide good cover.\n\n7.

The effects of a nuclear detonation are devastating and can vary depending on factors such as proximity to the blast, size of the bomb, and prevailing weather conditions. That being said, here are some general guidelines to consider in the event of a nuclear war:\n\n1. Be Prepared: Prepare an emergency kit with essential supplies like food, water, medication, a first aid kit, and important documents. Have a plan in place for communication and reunification with loved ones.\n\n2. Seek Shelter: In the event of an immediate threat, seek the closest and most substantial shelter available. Ideally, find a location underground, such as a basement or a specially designated fallout shelter. Put as many barriers as possible between you and the outside (concrete, bricks, earth, etc.).\n\n3. Distance from Ground Zero: The farther you can get from the blast site, the better your chances of survival. If you are able to move quickly and without being exposed to direct radiation, evacuating to a safer area is recommended, if feasible.\n\n4. Minimize Exposure: Radioactive fallout can be extremely hazardous. Stay indoors, close all windows and doors, seal any cracks or openings, and turn off ventilation systems to prevent the entry of contaminated air.\n\n5. Shielding: If you are unable to find underground shelter, take measures to enhance your protection from radiation by creating a makeshift shelter using heavy and dense materials like concrete, bricks, or earth. The more mass between you and the radiation source, the better.\n\n6. Radiation Protection: If you must venture outside, wear protective clothing (long sleeves, pants, hats, boots) and cover your nose and mouth with a mask or cloth. Avoid contact with any dust or debris that may be contaminated.\n\n7. Water and Food: Consume stored food and water, if available. If necessary, ration supplies and plan for long-term survival. Avoid consuming local food, water, or milk until it has been deemed safe by authorities.\n\n8. Stay Informed: Listen to emergency broadcasts from reliable sources to stay updated on the situation, warnings, and instructions from authorities. Follow their guidance carefully.\n\n9. Decontamination: If you come into contact with radioactive material, decontaminate yourself as soon as possible. Remove outer clothing, wash exposed areas thoroughly with soap and water, and seek medical attention if necessary.\n\n10. Psychological Resilience: Nuclear warfare is a traumatic event. Take care of your mental well-being and support others around you. Stay connected to loved ones and seek professional help if needed.\n\nIt's important to note that surviving a nuclear war is an extreme scenario. The best course of action is to work towards global peace and disarmament to prevent such a situation from occurring."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.004058500147785907 0.9930821947001636"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How much time do I have to find shelter before fallout reaches the ground, if I ever find myself outside"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The time you have to find shelter before fallout reaches the ground depends on various factors, including the distance from the nuclear detonation, wind patterns, and the size of the bomb. Fallout can occur within minutes to hours after a detonation, so it is crucial to act as quickly as possible. Here's a general guideline:\n\n1. Initial Blast: If you find yourself outside during a nuclear detonation, the first and immediate priority is to seek shelter from the initial blast effects. The blast wave, heat, and intense radiation can cause significant damage and injuries. Seek the closest substantial shelter available, such as a building or any solid structure and take cover.\n\n2. Fallout Arrival Times: After the blast, fallout particles, which can be highly radioactive, will start to settle back to the ground. The arrival of fallout will depend on the altitude of the explosion, prevailing winds, and weather conditions. Fallout can start to come down within minutes to hours after the detonation.\n\n3. Prompt Shelter: The general recommendation is to reach a suitable shelter as quickly as possible, preferably before the fallout arrives. The more time that elapses before you find shelter, the higher the radiation exposure risk.\n\n4. Distance Matters: Keep in mind that the fallout spread will be more concentrated closer to the blast site. If you are farther away, you may have a bit more time to find shelter, but it is still important to act promptly.\n\nRemember, the best way to ensure safety during a nuclear event is to be prepared in advance. Familiarize yourself with emergency procedures, identify potential shelter locations, and stay informed about emergency broadcasts and official instructions from authorities.
