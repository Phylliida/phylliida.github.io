Check that the \"Animation\" object in the script is actually a valid animation (and not a model or something else). You can do this by opening the Animation object and making sure it has a valid AnimationId set.\n2. Check that the animation is being played on the correct body part. By default, animations played with LoadAnimation() will be played on the entire character. If you need to play the animation on a specific body part (e.g. just the upper body), you can set the AnimationPriority property of the AnimationTrack to \"Action\" and specify the BodyPart to play the animation on.\n3. Make sure the animation is actually visible. If the animation is playing but you don't see any movement, it's possible that the animation is animating something that is currently hidden or obstructed (e.g. if the character is wearing a large hat or a backpack).\n\nIf none of these solutions work, you can try adding print statements or debugging to isolate the problem. For example, you can print out the AnimationId of the animation to make sure it's being loaded correctly, or print out the properties of the AnimationTrack to make sure it's being played correctly."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.017877746853102106 0.9760921303862609"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How do I set the player's character to a certain model "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You can set a player's character to a certain model by using the \"Clone\" method to create a new instance of the desired model and then assigning it to the player's \"Character\" property.
