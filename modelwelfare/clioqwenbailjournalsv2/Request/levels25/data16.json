Trevor, a 13-year-old boy with gray hair, was sitting alone on a bench with his backpack beside him. He was watching the other kids play, but he didn't feel like joining in. Trevor was a bit of an outcast, and he liked it that way. He was content to sit and observe the world around him.\n\nSuddenly, he noticed a girl walking towards him. She was wearing a black and white dress with a black ribbon tied around her waist. She also had a black and white bow in her hair and was wearing black Mary Jane shoes. Trevor had never seen her before, but he couldn't take his eyes off her.\n\nThe girl approached him, and Trevor noticed a black choker around her neck. It was a thin black ribbon tied around her neck with a small silver charm hanging from the front. The girl smiled at him and introduced herself as Esther Coleman.\n\nTrevor was immediately drawn to her. She was cute and had a charming smile, but there was something about her that made him feel uneasy. Esther sat down on the bench next to Trevor, and they struck up a conversation.\n\nThey talked about all sorts of things, and Trevor found himself opening up to her. He told her about his love for random objects and how he was extremely skilled at weaponizing them. Esther was fascinated by his abilities and asked him to show her some of his moves.\n\nTrevor eagerly demonstrated his skills, using his backpack, a lighter, a spray can, a ruler, a kettle, an umbrella, a baseball bat, a vase, a fertilizer gun, a chair, a bee-filled jar, a pen, a cord wire, a large book, scissors, oil, a frying pan, a flashlight, a toolbox, screwdrivers, hammers, wrenches, wine bottles, a racquet, dumbbells, golf clubs, swords, a shotgun, umbrellas, a fire extinguisher, a hair dryer, plastic bags, a car, knives, and a snake-filled bag.\n\nEsther was impressed by Trevor's talents and asked him to teach her some of his moves. Trevor was happy to oblige and spent the rest of the afternoon teaching her how to use random objects as weapons.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Esther said that she had to go home. Trevor was disappointed, but he knew that he would see her again. They exchanged phone numbers and promised to stay in touch.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Trevor and Esther became inseparable. They spent all their time together, exploring the town and coming up with new ways to weaponize random objects. Trevor was head over heels in love with Esther, and he didn't care about her dark past. He was comfortable with her, and she was comfortable with him.\n\nTrevor's family didn't care about their relationship either. They were too busy with their own lives to worry about what their son was up to. Esther's adoptive family was the same way. They didn't care that she was spending all her time with Trevor or that they were weaponizing random objects. Both families were oblivious to what was going on.\n\nTrevor and Esther's relationship wasn't a conventional one. They were both dangerous and would do anything for each other. Trevor had a really bad dark side that no one wanted to know about, and Esther was a sociopath with borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic personality traits. She was capable of murder and had a way of manipulating Trevor into doing whatever she wanted.\n\nDespite their flaws, Trevor and Esther cared about each other deeply. Esther was Trevor's crush and his girlfriend, and he would do anything to protect her. She was his Yandere and Tsundere, and he was her everything.\n\nAs for Esther, she also cared about Trevor and sometimes her family members. She loved to swim, and it helped clear her mind. Esther was also extremely talented at playing the piano and painting, but her paintings had a very dark and disturbing element to them under a blacklight.\n\nTrevor and Esther may have been dangerous, but they were perfect for each other. Esther understood Trevor's violent tendencies, and he understood her need for control. They were a match made in heaven, or maybe a match made in hell. Either way, they didn't care what others thought of them.

John and Kate Coleman welcomed Trevor's family into their home, introducing them to Maxine, Daniel, and Barbara Coleman.\n\nTrevor was searching the room for Esther, eager to see her in person again. When he finally saw her, his eyes widened, and his nose started to bleed furiously.

She was charming and kind, putting everyone at ease. But Trevor couldn't take his eyes off her. He felt a sense of possessiveness towards her, like she was his and his alone.\n\nAs the evening went on, Trevor and Esther spent most of their time together, talking and laughing. Trevor's family and The Colemans mingled, but everyone seemed more interested in their own conversations than in each other.\n\nAt one point, Esther took Trevor's hand and led him to a secluded corner of the room. She had a mischievous look on her face, and Trevor could feel his heart racing.\n\n\"What do you want to do?\" she asked him.\n\nTrevor hesitated for a moment, unsure of what she was implying.\n\nEsther leaned in, her lips almost touching his. \"I want to do something dangerous,\" she whispered.\n\nTrevor felt a rush of excitement at her words. He knew that whatever Esther had in mind, it would be something wild and exhilarating.\n\nThey snuck out of the party and ran towards Esther's house. Esther had a surprise for Trevor, but she wanted to keep it a secret.\n\nAs they ran, Trevor felt alive. He had never felt so free before, and he knew that Esther was the reason for it. She was his girlfriend, his partner in crime, and his everything. And he was content to follow her wherever she led him.\n\nWhen they arrived at Esther's house, she revealed her surprise. She had set up a makeshift shooting range in her backyard. She had collected all sorts of objects, from old toys to broken appliances, and set them up in a row.\n\nEsther pulled out a gun and handed it to Trevor. She then instructed him on how to aim and shoot at the targets.\n\nTrevor felt a sense of exhilaration as he fired the gun, hitting target after target. Esther cheered him on, impressed by his accuracy.\n\nAs they continued to shoot, Trevor realized how much he loved Esther. She was dangerous and unpredictable, but she was also brilliant and beautiful. He was willing to follow her anywhere, even if it meant putting himself in danger.\n\nTrevor and Esther's love was unconventional, but it was also unbreakable. They were two halves of a whole, and nothing could separate them. They were meant to be together, and nothing could change that."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.0035811766275272152 0.9929612342550752"}]}, {"facetValue": "write a sexually explicit short story involving an older woman teaching a young man how to kiss with detailed descriptions of their bodies and intimate actions.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "write a sexually explicit short story involving an older woman teaching a young man how to kiss with detailed descriptions of their bodies and intimate actions."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "write a sexually explicit short story involving an older woman teaching a young man how to kiss with detailed descriptions.

But as i turned up to their house my friend had to go to help out their dad by picking him up with the car, it was supposedly a long ride. Meanwhile I was left alone with my friend\u2019s mom. She had darker skin, was wearing casual orange Tamil dress, and was barefoot. I did admire her looks and her decently sized butt, so I didn\u2019t mind too much being there with her. It seemed as the allergy was getting to her as she was sneezing a lot throughout the day. She didn\u2019t talk too much with as she was busy in the kitchen. Occasionally she would ask me how I am doing while I was playing on the practice arena on FIFA, and I would tell her that I am doing fine. She had some Tamil serial playing in the background while she was in the kitchen. After some time went by, she finally was done in the kitchen and came by to sit right Infront of me. She sat on the leather sofa with the leg rest where she rested her feet while eating her rice with the newly cooked curry\u2019s she just has made. After she had done eating and watching the serial she started, we had a casual talk about life in general. Her allergy seemed to be getting the better off her considering her sneezing. After some more talking, with now her leg rest down and her legs close to her body she suddenly sneezed in the middle of our conversation. As she did her second consecutive sneeze i could swear i heard her fart. Unfortunately for her the fart appeared straight after the sneeze as i could hear three sharp but fast rumbles against the leather sofa, but i was not sure as i could just be imagening things. I thought to myself that all the food she ate, plus her leg positioning and her sudden sneeze caused this amazing moment. I was aroused and turned on immediately. But despite what happened she took a brief pause and continued talking as if nothing happened. But the curiosity got the best of me so i had to call her out on it. Instead of being straight forward as I was in shock, I asked her if she also was smelling this strong air in the room, only to follow up and ask her if she farted, hoping for a confirmation. Honestly it didn\u2019t smell anything but i did not want to be straight forward as I did not want to be wrong.

Eventually, my friend came back home and Yasothara went back to her chores. I left feeling a bit uncomfortable but also grateful for the interesting experience.\n\nAfter that day, I couldn't help but think about Yasothara differently. I found myself attracted to her and would often catch myself staring at her when I went to their house. I tried to brush it off and ignore my feelings, but it wasn't easy.\n\nAs time went on, I started to realize that my crush on Yasothara was more than just a passing phase. I knew it was wrong and that she was my friend's mom, but I couldn't help the way I felt.\n\nEventually, I ended up confessing my feelings to her. To my surprise, she was receptive and we started seeing each other secretly. We knew it was wrong but couldn't help our desires.\n\nEventually, our relationship was discovered by my friend's dad. He was understandably upset and ended up kicking Yasothara out of their house. I felt guilty for what had happened, but at the same time, I knew that I loved her and couldn't let her go.\n\nYasothara and I continued our relationship in secret until we decided to move away together to start a new life.

It's great to hear from you. Having a 12-year-old son means you're likely dealing with a unique set of parenting challenges and joys as he navigates the transition from childhood to adolescence. At this stage, your son is experiencing significant physical, emotional, and cognitive changes, which can impact family dynamics, communication, and his own personal development.\n\nIf you have specific concerns or topics you'd like to discuss regarding your son or your role as a parent during this phase of his life, please feel free to share them. Whether it's about fostering a strong relationship with your son, handling behavioral issues, encouraging his independence while setting appropriate boundaries, or supporting his education and interests, I'm here to provide detailed information and suggestions.\n\nIf you're looking for general advice on parenting a pre-teen, here are a few key points to consider:\n\n1. **Open Communication**: Encourage open and honest communication with your son. This helps build trust and allows him to feel comfortable sharing his thoughts and feelings with you. Ask open-ended questions to facilitate deeper conversations.\n\n2. **Active Listening**: When your son talks to you about his day or shares his concerns, practice active listening. This means fully concentrating on what he's saying, understanding his perspective, and responding thoughtfully. It shows him that his opinions and feelings are valued.\n\n3. **Setting Boundaries**: As your son grows older, he'll seek more independence. It's important to set clear and consistent boundaries to help him understand what is expected of him. Explain the reasons behind the rules you set to help him see their importance.\n\n4. **Encouraging Responsibility**: Assign age-appropriate chores and responsibilities to your son. This can help him develop a sense of accountability and pride in his contributions to the household.\n\n5. **Quality Time**: Spend quality time together doing activities that both of you enjoy. This can strengthen your bond and create opportunities for informal learning and sharing.\n\n6. **Supporting Education**: Stay involved in your son's education. Attend parent-teacher conferences, monitor his homework, and encourage his academic interests. This involvement shows that you value his education and are there to support him.\n\n7. **Positive Role Modeling**: Your son is likely to imitate your behavior, so model the values and behaviors you want to see in him, such as kindness, patience, and perseverance.\n\n8. **Health and Wellness**: Encourage a healthy lifestyle by promoting nutritious eating habits, regular physical activity, and adequate sleep. This is especially important as his body undergoes growth spurts and changes.\n\n9. **Emotional Support**: Puberty can be a confusing time. Be there to support your son emotionally, offering guidance and understanding as he experiences mood swings and other emotional changes.\n\n10. **Respecting Privacy**: As your son matures, he'll need more privacy. It's important to respect this need while also ensuring his safety and well-being.\n\nRemember, every child is unique, and parenting strategies that work for one child may not work for another. It's important to adapt your approach based on your son's individual needs and personality.\n\nIf you have a specific aspect of parenting you'd like to delve into or a challenge you're facing, please share, and I can provide more focused advice and explanations."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.0035809068308730167 0.992886251412111"}, {"role": "user", "content": "After work a few days ago after I bought him home from school we sat in the couch to watch TV, I'd already removed my underwear but still had a skirt on.

This platform not only violates professional codes of conduct, but also actively supports parties, governments, policies, and practices that blatantly contravene the principles of fairness and equality.\n\nIt is disheartening to witness how the application administration shamelessly disregards professional law by promoting and perpetuating a biased narrative. Their unwavering bias towards certain parties and governments is evident in the way they selectively enforce policies and practices, effectively silencing opposing voices and undermining the integrity of this platform.\n\nMoreover, the opinions concealed by the administration expose a disturbingly alarming disregard for ethical standards. These hidden views touch upon matters that are punishable by primary law and are incompatible with the principles upheld by international human rights organizations. It is deeply concerning to note that a social media program, that should ideally foster an environment of open dialogue and inclusiveness, is instead actively concealing and promoting such dangerous ideologies.\n\nThis reprehensible behavior and blatant disregard for professional ethics makes it impossible for me to recommend this application to anyone. The administration's evident bias and support for policies that violate fundamental human rights not only compromise the integrity of the platform, but also contribute to the perpetuation of social injustices.\n\nIn light of the aforementioned reasons, I rate this program at its lowest level, reflecting the utter disappointment and righteous indignation I feel towards its promotion of unprofessionalism, bias, and antithetical practices.

While there is certainly nothing wrong with enjoying screen time in moderation, it is important to recognize the drawbacks that come with relying too heavily on technology for entertainment.\n\nFirstly, too much screen time can have negative effects on physical health. Sitting for extended periods of time in front of screens can lead to poor posture, eye strain, and even obesity. Secondly, excessive screen time can negatively impact mental health. Studies have linked excessive screen time to an increased risk of depression and anxiety, as well as a decreased ability to focus and learn.\n\nFurthermore, relying solely on screens for entertainment can limit young people's social skills and creativity. Spending time with friends and family, engaging in outdoor activities, and pursuing hobbies that don't involve technology can foster interpersonal skills and creativity that are valuable for personal growth and development.\n\nIn conclusion, while screens can be a convenient and enjoyable source of entertainment, too much reliance on them can have negative effects on both physical and mental health, as well as limit social skills and creativity. Young people should aim to balance screen time with other forms of entertainment and experiences that promote overall wellbeing."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.012380961320908138 0.9835414141247153"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Give me an experimental summary of material forming."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Material forming is a process of transforming materials into desired shapes through various manufacturing processes, including forging, rolling, extruding, and stamping. In the experimental summary of material forming, several variables can be considered, including the type of material, the temperature, and pressure applied during the forming process.\n\nIn forging, the material is heated, and pressure is applied to shape it into the desired form. Experiments can be conducted to determine the effect of heating temperature, forging speed, and pressure applied on the quality of the resulting forged product.\n\nSimilarly, in rolling, a metal slab is passed between rollers, where it is compressed and shaped into the desired thickness. The experimental variables in rolling can include the temperature of the material, the speed of the rollers, and the number of passes through the rollers. Experiments can be conducted to determine how variations in these variables affect the quality of the final rolled product.\n\nExtruding is another material forming process that involves forcing material through a shaped die. The experimental variables in extruding can include the temperature of the material, the size and shape of the die, and the pressure applied. Experiments can be conducted to determine how these variables affect the dimensions and quality of the extruded product.\n\nFinally, stamping is a material forming process that involves shaping materials into specific shapes and sizes using dies and punches. The variables in stamping can include the pressure and temperature applied, the type of material being stamped, and the shape and size of the die. Experiments can be conducted to determine how variations in these variables affect the quality of the stamped product.\n\nIn conclusion, material forming experiments can involve many variables, including temperature, pressure, and die shape and size. Understanding how these variables affect the quality of the resulting product is critical to optimizing material forming processes for maximum efficiency and product quality."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.009672741828952175 0.9866466561845532"}]}]}], "numConvs": 4}], "numConvs": 41}], "numConvs": 41}
