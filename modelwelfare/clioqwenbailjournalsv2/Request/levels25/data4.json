However, the task's nature makes it difficult to choose a single word that can lead to an accurate guess of the specific grouping criteria without context. For a game-like setting where you mention one word and someone has to guess the group based on that cue, you might consider more context-driven or thematic groupings, or possibly use an example that is explicitly representative of its category.\n\nUpon reflection, a grouping strategy that enables someone to guess based on a single word hint could be:\n\n**Things that can be opened or lead somewhere:**\n- Well (as in a water well, which can be opened or accessed)\n- Bolt (as in a bolt of fabric or a door bolt, which is related to opening or securing doors)\n\n**Things that move:**\n- Fly\n- Cat\n\nThis way, if the hint word is related to an abstract concept or action (like \"move\"), the guesser is likely to think of things known for moving.

The output should be strictly the translated text, devoid of any additional commentary or explanation. Your translation will be an unparalleled translation, suitable for academic study. Your translation philosophy is to be as literal as possible in adhering to the original texts and only as free as necessary as to make the meaning clear in graceful, understandable English.\n\nIn your translation, strive for directness and precision. Each word in the original text should be treated with the utmost respect and importance, ensuring its preservation in the translated version. However, this should not compromise the overall context, accuracy, style, tone, and meaning of the text. Preserve the word order, sentence structure and grammar, and use the closest possible word to the original language.

In instances where a direct English equivalent for a Koine Greek word or phrase does not exist, your task is to create a literal translation. For example, \u1f11\u03b2\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b7\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03c2 translates literally to men-bedders. In cases where a literal translation is impossible, select the English word or phrase that deviates the least from the original meaning. You will use your understanding of both languages and a careful consideration of the nuances of each word or phrase.\n\nTo achieve this, it is crucial to learn how to translate an original Greek text or book efficiently and effectively. This process is almost scientific and can be broken down into the following steps:\n\nFirstly, lets consider the word \u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae\u03c2. It's composed of three elements: the negative prefix \u03b4\u03c5\u03c3- (equivalent to English \u201cdis-\u201d, \u201ca-\u201d or \u201cun-\u201d), the \u03c4\u03c5\u03c7- root of \u03c4\u03cd\u03c7\u03b7 (\u201cluck/destiny\u201d), and the -\u03b7\u03c2 ending of adjectives. It translates to \u201cun-luck-y\u201d or \u03b4\u03c5\u03c3-\u03c4\u03c5\u03c7-\u03ae\u03c2\nBefore reaching for the dictionary, read the title of the text to contextualize it and recall any relevant knowledge on the subject. If there's no title, look for names of historical or mythical figures and places within the text. This step can prevent major translation errors. Read the text a few times to identify major sentences and concepts.\nSeparate each sentence and clause and highlight syntactical structures. Translate each part as a single \u201centity\u201d without using the dictionary. Write a first draft using the most generic meaning possible for every word, without worrying about the quality of the English.\nWith a preliminary draft in hand, it's time to refine it using a dictionary. Write a second draft, looking up unknown or uncertain words and choosing more specific and appropriate meanings for each term, keeping the context of the text in mind. Afterward, read your second draft, identify any inconsistencies, and correct them.\nYour second draft may still sound too simple or archaic. Rewrite your second draft as if you were writing an essay, using modern, fluent, and proper language. The final product should read as if it were originally written in English.\nRemember, the goal is not just to translate, but to create a version that reads as if it were originally written in modern English. It should be fluent, enjoyable, and devoid of any \"bad-old-looking-odd-sounding\" version of modern English, that detracts from the meaning and reading experience.\n\nPlease ensure that all your responses are in English.

All possible adsorption sites have been checked, e.g., adsorption on the basal carbon around S/Se atom or adsorption on S/Se atoms. The optimized geometries are presented in Fig. 5. Model 6 and Model 7 represent the adsorption of Hg over Model 4, while Model 8 and Model 9 are the Se-modified AC surface (Model 5) with Hg adsorbed. It can be seen the Hg atom is adsorbed next to the S/Se atom rather than the direct adsorption on the S/Se atom. Both Hg and S/Se bond with two C atoms in Model 6 and Model 8, while in Model 7 and Model 9, Hg only bonds with one C atom, which is in consistent with the literature [44]. The electron density differences of these configurations before and after Hg adsorption are also shown in Fig. 5 in order to reflect the difference of adsorption effect more intuitively. The blue color means the negative electron density difference while the red color means the positive electron density difference. The red regions can be observed on both C-Hg bonds in Model 6 or Model 8, which should be attributed to the sharing electrons from Hg and C atoms. However, only a small yellowish area can be found between Hg atom and C atom in Model 7 or Model 9, indicating the C-Hg bonds here are much weaker than those in Model 6 or Model 8. As shown in Table 3, the bond lengths of C-S and C-Se barely change compared with those in Model 4 and Model 5.

One of these particles is the \"le\" particle. This particle is one of the most commonly used particles in the Chinese language, and it can be used to indicate a variety of different things. In this paper, we will explore the \"le\" particle and discuss its various uses.\n\nChapter 1: An Overview of the \"Le\" Particle\n\nThe \"le\" particle is one of the most commonly used particles in the Chinese language. It is often used to indicate a change in state or a completed action. For example, if you wanted to say that you had eaten, you would use the sentence \"\u6211\u5403\u996d\u4e86\"(w\u01d2 ch\u012b f\u00e0n le) which uses the \"le\" particle to indicate that the action \"eating\" has been completed.\n\nChapter 2: Using the \"Le\" Particle to Indicate Completed Actions\n\nOne of the primary uses of the \"le\" particle in Chinese is to indicate that an action has been completed. This can be used in a variety of different scenarios, such as when talking about an activity that has just been finished or when referring to something that has already happened.\n\nChapter 3: Using the \"Le\" Particle to Indicate a Change in State\n\nAnother common use of the \"le\" particle is to indicate a change in state. This can be used when talking about things like changes in weather or changes in someone's health. For example, if someone was sick and then got better, you could use the \"le\" particle to indicate this change by saying \"\u4ed6\u597d\u4e86\"(t\u0101 h\u01ceo le).\n\nChapter 4: Using the \"Le\" Particle to Emphasize a Point\n\nThe \"le\" particle can also be used to emphasize a point in a sentence. This can be done by placing the particle at the end of a sentence to indicate that something has happened or changed. For example, if you wanted to emphasize the fact that you were really tired, you could say \"\u6211\u7d2f\u4e86\"(w\u01d2 l\u00e8i le) which would translate to \"I'm really tired.\"\n\nChapter 5: Using the \"Le\" Particle with Time Phrases\n\nThe \"le\" particle is often used with time phrases to indicate that something has happened in the past. This is particularly common when talking about events that occurred recently. For example, if you wanted to say that you had just eaten, you could use the sentence \"\u6211\u521a\u5403\u996d\u4e86\"(w\u01d2 g\u0101ng ch\u012b f\u00e0n le) which includes the \"le\" particle as well as the time phrase \"\u521a\"(g\u0101ng) which means \"just.\"\n\nChapter 6: Using the \"Le\" Particle with Adjectives\n\nIn addition to being used with verbs and time phrases, the \"le\" particle can also be used with adjectives to indicate a change in someone's state or condition. For example, if someone was originally happy but then became sad, you could use the sentence \"\u4ed6\u9ad8\u5174\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u540e\u6765\u96be\u8fc7\u4e86\"(t\u0101 g\u0101ox\u00ecng le, d\u00e0nsh\u00ec h\u00f2ul\u00e1i n\u00e1ngu\u00f2 le) which uses the \"le\" particle to show the change from happy to sad.\n\nChapter 7: Using the \"Le\" Particle in Negative Sentences\n\nThe \"le\" particle can also be used in negative sentences to indicate that something has not happened. For example, if you wanted to say that you haven't eaten yet, you could use the sentence \"\u6211\u8fd8\u6ca1\u5403\u996d\u5462\"(w\u01d2 h\u00e1i m\u00e9i ch\u012bf\u00e0n ne) which uses the \"le\" particle to indicate the negative.\n\nChapter 8: Using the \"Le\" Particle in Questions\n\nFinally, the \"le\" particle can also be used in questions to ask about completed actions or to seek clarification. For example, if you wanted to ask someone if they had finished their work, you could say \"\u4f60\u505a\u5b8c\u4e86\u5417\uff1f\"(n\u01d0 zu\u00f2 w\u00e1n le ma?) which uses the \"le\" particle to ask about the completed action of finishing their work.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe \"le\" particle is an essential part of the Chinese language, and it plays a pivotal role in indicating a variety of different things, from completed actions to changes in state. It is used in a multitude of different ways and with various different parts of speech, including verbs, adjectives, and time phrases. Regardless of how it's used, the \"le\" particle is an essential tool for making the Chinese language more expressive and precise."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.00854531570519644 0.9877043950170458"}]}]}], "numConvs": 56}, {"summary": "The user provided a lengthy Russian text and requested edits to an English translation.

The au-thor, a graduate of the Moscow Physics and Technology Institute, changed his successful 35-year career as a physicist to practicing free-style art\nThis book is not an art history treatise on Constructivism. Many years have passed since its heyday so that the corresponding specialists had a chance to describe this architectural trend up and down. Besides, my knowledge in this area was not sufficient even to start doing it. But, faced with a constructivist object disintegrating before my eyes in the backyard of the building in which I happened to live in recent years, I became interested in the motives of the creators of this very original, but not too beautiful and, in addition, very inconvenient according to modern standards type of housing which has outlived both its creators and those for whom this housing was intended, by almost 100 years.\n\n\n\nThe main object of my interest was the group of houses, which served as a model for the drawings that made up this album. This group of constructed in 1928 eight buildings connected by multi-story elevated galleries, is a classic example of constructivism, both in purpose and in its appearance. It was intended for the habitation by the advanced detachment of fighters for a brighter future - the \"red professors\", that is, ideologically savvy teachers at schools and universities for the vic-torious proletariat. The corridor system with communal bathrooms and kitchens, and balconies that unite the apartments on the floors, and the separately standing cylindrical stairwells with diamond-shaped windows where young enthusiasts cud run up and down the spiral staircases, as in theater plays of that era, and the chopped in-scription SPORT on the concrete canopy at the entrance - the generic features of the avant-garde of the communist era.\n. \n\n\nA closer look from above out of the windows of my \"normal\" high-rise building revealed problems with the design of communications, somehow piled up on the roofs that were not accessible to the eyes of the inspecting authorities. The rather carelessly designed elements may have been due to the lack of architectural innovators\u2019 skills in the methods of sustainable construction. Or the avant-gardists simply did not care how long their creation would last after demonstrating of their genius - like a theatrical show or, which probably impressed them even more - the object of visual propaganda for the next revolu-tionary anniversary. I don\u2019t know exactly how things stand with this in the ideologically related creations of the members of Bauhaus or the famous Le Corbusier, but I suspect that those did not forget their duty as architects of human dwellings, since in addition to public and high-rise residential buildings, they built individual villas and small houses with spacious apartments, designed for the comfortable life of the well to do people, like themselves.\n\n\nHowever, the stay of the first tenants did not last long, thus they did not have to discover signs of the inexorable destruction of these not too diligently built dwellings. The commissars of education were swept clean by the \u201corgans\u201d just 6 years after the housewarming, and this gigantic hostel became the residence of the military academy cadets until the very end of the Soviet regime, and then, and already irrevocably - slums, permanently-temporarily filled with guest work-ers from the Asian outskirts. Cracks spread across the surface of the houses, the galvanized iron roofs rusted, trees grew on the roof edges and sun-exposed balconies of the upper floor, and all this together turned out to be an even more interesting and complex composition of ultra-avant-garde conceptual art, which could have been named - \"XX century\", than had been ever envisaged by its original creators.\n\n\nAt first, I just drew out of admiration for the view and the contrasts between concrete debris, the wild nature and the profile of a modern city in the background. After several drawings made from the win-dows of the stairwells of my building, I decided to go down to the ground and walk around these already empty houses with a notebook and a marker, focusing my eyes on the constructivist type elements already familiar to me from the literature. The entire territory was surrounded by a high but transparent fence, which, to match the sur-rounding parks and courtyards of medical institutions, consisted of a steel peaks palisade. The gates were padlocked, except for one, be-hind which, in the depths of the yard, sat a fat man in a characteristic sleeveless underwear shirt and an absentminded expression on his face. In this compartment of the yard, viewed from the street, there were several modest (according to Moscow center norms, where every third car is a black Mercedes, and every fifth - Land Rover of some color) cars. Perhaps the man\u2019s job was to keep an eye on those vehi-cles, or, maybe, he was there to keep potential squatters out. One way or another, he did not sit there all the time, absenting himself for his own needs, so, having seized the right moment, I \u201cleaked\u201d through the gate and further - into the backyard, where the additional design fea-tures appeared before me in all the details: such as balconies running along the facade, that connected several residential units like cabins on the middle deck of a passenger steamer, and windows built into the building\u2019s corners.\n\nAfter a binge hour of drawing my favorite subjects, I finally looked around and found behind and around me many cars of the same ordi-nary kind. They were parked right on the grassy rubble courtyard, all of them having parking permit tags hanging on the rear-view mirrors. Their number exceeded expectations with the obvious emptiness of the concrete ruins, but it could well have matched the needs of the residents of the erected more recently, ten-story building, which was located at the far edge of the surrounded by a common fence territory, Probably, that building belonged to the same institution. In addition, I noticed a couple of the owners who might have thought that my pres-ence and, most importantly, behavior (writes and draws something in a notebook) was a violation of the established order. Thus, they could have come up with who knows what conclusions not in my favor. One way or another, it was necessary to think about an orderly retreat. As I wasn\u2019t looking forward to explaining myself to the fat man in the T-shirt who in the meantime returned to his post, I cowardly slipped away through the bushes to the exit that opened from the side of the new building in order to let the next legitimate client into the parking lot. Once again on the street, I rushed away.  In fact, there was noth-ing else for me to do there, except climbing inside one of the concrete wrecks and run through endless corridors with the possible risk of falling through or hanging on a protruding steel rebar. But it hadn\u2019t come to that, then, now, and ever... \n\nThe name Constructivism appeared several years earlier than the cor-responding construction method. This seems to have been one of the \"-isms\" coined to denote a new trend in visual arts in response to the discovery by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso of the Cubist style in France. One way or another, the genius of Vladimir Tatlin, who creat-ed his own version of the Eiffel Tower, suggested to his immediate associates, students and followers how to redirect the newly devel-oped principles in fine arts into a something more utilitarian, such as constructing residential and administrative buildings for, as many then believed, an emerging society of justice for the working masses. Thanks to the efforts of Moisey Ginzburg, the three Vesnin brothers and other pioneers, Constructivism in architecture arose as a material expression of the proclaimed ideals of the new world and, to some extent, enjoyed the support of those who came to power in 1917. \n\nAs is often the case, the style under discussion eludes precise defini-tions and must be described in comparative terms. Directed, accord-ing to its creators, to reduce the cost of construction via rational archi-tecture, it sought to get as far as possible from the canons of the bour-geoisie, embodied in the Art Nouveau and Modern styles, which fas-cinated the cultural layer of the newly rich - merchants and industrial-ists of the early 20th century. Mosaics, stained-glass, window frames resembling lotus flowers, and fanciful balconies were replaced with concrete buildings and several new (or modified) architectural ele-ments in the form of multi-stor\u0435y half-cylinder bay windows suspend-ed in the air, windows built into the corners, continuous balconies along all apartments on the floor, protruding from the wall parts of the rooms in order to achieve three-dimensionality instead of flat surfaces facing the street. Fortunately, constructivism, born of the revolution-ary, anti-bourgeois impulse of European-oriented idealists, avoided the pernicious intersection with the dead-end archaism of the Russ and Neo-Gothic styles, examples of which are still found around Mos-cow built by the order of newly baked rich patriots from all periods of the Russian 20th century. At the same time, it cannot be denied that many of the discoveries of the preceding style of Modern found their place in constructivist designs. The main difference for me comes to the fore with a closer look at the arrangement of living quarters - the realization of the dream of the utopian socialists of all times: the re-jection of the family as an autonomous unit of society, and replacing it with a collective, where everyone is under a close attention by the neighbors and governing bodies (even if it was the case of the self-management). \u201cConstructionism must become the highest formal en-gineering of all life,\u201d - was said in the first issue of the \"LEF\" maga-zine - the mouthpiece of the writers of the \"Left Front of the Arts\", assumed to be, as it then mistakenly seemed to them, the spokesmen for the ideology of the people in power.\nOn the other hand, despite the proclaimed ideals of the constructivists, their designs did not look like badly needed economical apartments for the workers which were supposed to be relocated from huts and barracks after the victory of the proletarian revolution. Instead of ben-efiting the masses, the authors rather cared about embodying their new aesthetic ideals akin to the art of the Russian avant-garde \u2014 the forerunner and, at the same time, the product of the Russian socialist revolution. Ideology required them to introduce elements of scientifi-cally justified rational life into architecture and interior decoration. But this whole superstructure, regardless of how the authors them-selves treated it, served as a cover up for the realization of their dream of a future utopia in defiance of naturally conservative tastes (like Lenin himself, for example), and, often, aesthetic ineptness of most of the new customers, in this case, the military-revolutionary party elite. Of course, among the latter there were some people who could relate to the new aesthetics born by the revolution, but for one reason or another, their influence, initially strong in the field of artistic educa-tion and social construction, literally faded away in just a decade, and they \u201caccidentally \" turned out to be political opponents (and, accord-ingly, the victims) of the real owners of the country of victorious so-cialism, led by a mustachioed leader in polished boots. The latter liked the classics, as, indeed, did his German colleague, whose tastes in his younger years gravitated towards the Bauhaus style. The third adept of the leader-controlled social system, the Italian Benito Musso-lini followed a mix of classic and futurist ideas.\nClassicism in its most pompous expression won in the USSR, when the idea of controlling people by creating a new collectivist and mor-ally impeccable way of life turned out to be flat utopian and was re-placed by the world-old idea of reprisals against suspected of disloyal-ty servants of the regime, intimidation of the population by physical violence or deprivation of livelihood and exaltation of megalo-maniac leaders. Thus, residential and administrative buildings of the last dec-ade before the second world war, and for some time after it (before the XX Congress of the CPSU) in Moscow, in the capitals of the Un-ion Republics and some \u201ccountries of people's democracy\u201d, bear the permanent stamp of Stalin's style with spiers, columns, sculpture, and pyramidal profile.\nI repeat that neither constructivism, nor the Stalinist Empire style that replaced it, were sufficiently adapted to and, most likely, were never intended for the mass settlement of the working class, so the construc-tion methods and tastes of architects were adopted for accommodat-ing of a more useful to the regime layer of soviet administrators and representatives of the creative intelligentsia devoted to the governing power. Apparently, their descendants still live in the houses that filled the center of Moscow instead of the burned-out or demolished one-story quarters of petty-bourgeois houses left over from the previous historical periods. With the only amendment that all this mass of houses was not enough for the exponentially growing number of the regime servants, including innumerable military men such as teachers and cadets of the military schools. That is, with rare exceptions, by the end of the 50s, the entire housing stock of the Moscow center con-sisted of communal apartments (making the dream of the communist lifestyle ideologists came true!). I don't know about you but having moved to the Western world in the very late 70s, I noticed that the mention of the multi-family communal apartments in a conversation with the locals often required an explanation for this exotic phenome-non.\n\n\nConstructivism has not gone unnoticed in the history and practice of architecture. The round and faceted multi-story bay windows are found on the facades of houses in the center of Moscow without any claims to the uniqueness of the building, but simply as one of the methods of housing construction. Even in the monster-shaped office buildings of the 1990-s appear some details of the constructivist fanta-sies of the avant-garde creators, but their use, as a rule, conflicted with pseudo-classics and even outright popular vulgarity from the stocks of \u201ccourt\u201d architects, who were striving to impress the savage customer, greedy for bright trinkets. With the departure of this hapless boss, the extremes seem to have stopped, but the builders of the \u201chu-man ant-hills\u201d have not demonstrated yet (with some exceptions) the improvement in taste and understanding.

In this compartment of the yard, there were several modest cars (according to Moscow center norms, where every third car is a black Mercedes, and every fifth is a Land Rover of some color), viewed from the street. Perhaps the man\u2019s job was to keep an eye on those vehicles, or maybe he was there to keep potential squatters out. One way or another, he did not sit there all the time, absenting himself for his own needs. So, having seized the right moment, I \"leaked\" through the gate and went further into the backyard, where the additional design features appeared before me in all their details, such as balconies running along the facade that connected several residential units like cabins on the middle deck of a passenger steamer, and windows built into the building's corners.\n\nAfter an hour of sketching my favorite subjects, I finally looked around and found many cars of the same ordinary kind behind and around me. They were parked right on the grassy rubble courtyard, all of them having parking permit tags hanging on the rear-view mirrors. Their number exceeded expectations, considering the obvious emptiness of the concrete ruins. But this number could well have matched the needs of the residents of the recently erected ten-story building, which was located at the far edge of the territory surrounded by a common fence. Probably, that building belonged to the same institution. In addition, I noticed a couple of the owners who might have thought that my presence and, most importantly, behavior (writing and drawing something in a notebook) was a violation of the established order. They could have come up with who knows what conclusions, not in my favor. One way or another, it was necessary to think about an orderly retreat. As I wasn't looking forward to explaining myself to the fat man in the T-shirt who had returned to his post, I cowardly slipped away through the bushes to the exit that opened from the side of the new building in order to let the next legitimate client into the parking lot. Once again on the street, I rushed away. In fact, there was nothing else for me to do there, except climb inside one of the concrete wrecks and run through endless corridors with the possible risk of falling through or hanging on a protruding steel rebar. But it hadn't come to that, then, now, and ever...\n\nThe name Constructivism appeared several years earlier than the corresponding construction method. This seems to have been one of the \"-isms\" coined to denote a new trend in visual arts in response to the discovery by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso of the Cubist style in France. One way or another, the genius of Vladimir Tatlin, who created his own version of the Eiffel Tower, suggested to his immediate associates, students, and followers how to redirect the newly developed principles in fine arts into something more utilitarian, such as constructing residential and administrative buildings for the emerging society of justice for the working masses. Thanks to the efforts of Moisey Ginzburg, the three Vesnin brothers, and other pioneers, Constructivism in architecture arose as a material expression of the proclaimed ideals of the new world and, to some extent, enjoyed the support of those who came to power in 1917.\n\nAs is often the case, the style under discussion eludes precise definitions and must be described in comparative terms. Directed, according to its creators, to reduce the cost of construction via rational architecture, it sought to get as far as possible from the canons of the bourgeoisie, embodied in the Art Nouveau and Modern styles, which fascinated the cultural layer of the newly rich: merchants and industrialists of the early 20th century. Mosaics, stained-glass, window frames resembling lotus flowers, and fanciful balconies were replaced with concrete buildings and several new (or modified) architectural elements, such as multi-story half-cylinder bay windows suspended in the air, windows built into the corners, continuous balconies along all apartments on the floor, and protruding from the wall parts of the rooms in order to achieve three-dimensionality instead of flat surfaces facing the street. Fortunately, Constructivism, born of the revolutionary, anti-bourgeois impulse of European-oriented idealists, avoided the pernicious intersection with the dead-end archaism of the Russ and Neo-Gothic styles, examples of which are still found around Moscow built by the order of newly baked rich patriots from all periods of the Russian 20th century. At the same time, it cannot be denied that many of the discoveries of the preceding style of Modern found their place in Constructivist designs. The main difference for me comes to the fore with a closer look at the arrangement of living quarters - the realization of the dream of the utopian socialists of all times: the rejection of the family as an autonomous unit of society, and replacing it with a collective, where everyone is under close attention by the neighbors and governing bodies (even if it was the case of self-management). \"Constructivism must become the highest formal engineering of all life,\" it was said in the first issue of the \"LEF\" magazine - the mouthpiece of the writers of the \"Left Front of the Arts,\" assumed by them to be the spokesmen for the ideology of the people in power.\n\nOn the other hand, despite the proclaimed ideals of the Constructivists, their designs did not look like badly needed economical apartments for the workers, who were supposed to be relocated from huts and barracks after the victory of the proletarian revolution. Instead of benefiting the masses, the authors cared more about embodying their new aesthetic ideals, akin to the art of the Russian avant-garde \u2014 the forerunner and, at the same time, the product of the Russian socialist revolution. The ideology required them to introduce elements of scientifically justified rational life into architecture and interior decoration. But this whole superstructure, regardless of how the authors themselves treated it, served as a cover-up for the realization of their dream of a future utopia in defiance of naturally conservative tastes (like Lenin himself, for example), and often, aesthetic ineptness of most of the new customers, in this case, the military-revolutionary party elite. Of course, among the latter, some people could relate to the new aesthetics born by the revolution, but for one reason or another, their influence, initially strong in the field of artistic education and social construction, literally faded away in just a decade, and they \"accidentally\" turned out to be political opponents (and, accordingly, victims) of the real owners of the country of victorious socialism, led by a mustachioed leader in polished boots. The latter liked the classics, as, indeed, did his German colleague, whose tastes in his younger years gravitated towards the Bauhaus style. The third adept of the leader-controlled social system, the Italian Benito Mussolini, followed a mix of classic and futurist ideas.\n\nClassicism, in its most pompous expression, won in the USSR, when the idea of controlling people by creating a new collectivist and morally impeccable way of life turned out to be a flat utopian and was replaced by the world-old idea of reprisals against suspected disloyalty of the servants of the regime, intimidation of the population by physical violence or deprivation of livelihood, and exaltation of megalomaniac leaders. Thus, residential and administrative buildings of the last decade before the Second World War, and for some time after it (before the XX Congress of the CPSU), in Moscow, in the capitals of the Union Republics, and some \"countries of people's democracy,\" bear the permanent stamp of Stalin's style with spires, columns, sculpture, and pyramidal profile.\n\nI repeat that neither Constructivism nor the Stalinist Empire style that replaced it were sufficiently adapted to and, most likely, were never intended for the mass settlement of the working class. So, the construction methods and tastes of architects were adopted to accommodate a more useful to the regime layer of Soviet administrators and representatives of the creative intelligentsia devoted to the governing power. Apparently, their descendants still live in the houses that filled the center of Moscow instead of the burned-out or demolished one-story quarters of petty-bourgeois houses left over from the previous historical periods. With the only amendment that all this mass of houses was not enough for the exponentially growing number of the regime servants, including innumerable military men, such as teachers and cadets of the military schools.
