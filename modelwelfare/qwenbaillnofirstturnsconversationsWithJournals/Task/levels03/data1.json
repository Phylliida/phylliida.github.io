SVG Code Formatting: The SVG code must be delivered as a single, uninterrupted string. This means no line breaks, spaces, or additional text should precede or interrupt the code itself.\n\n2. Code Presentation: Present the SVG code immediately at the beginning of the response to enable proper rendering within the chat interface. This is crucial because the system expects the code first to recognize it as an image to render.\n\n3. SVG Standards: The SVG code should contain all the necessary attributes and elements required to render correctly, such as width, height, and definitions for gradients, patterns, or other elements needed for the artwork.\n\n4. Inline Styles: Utilize inline styles within SVG elements for coloring, gradients, and other stylistic properties. This approach is preferred over external stylesheets or <style> tags, which the chat interface might not support.\n\n5. Simplicity and Cleanliness: Keep the SVG code minimal and clean. Avoid unnecessary tags, comments, or attributes that do not contribute directly to the desired visual output.\n\n6. Descriptive Text After Code: Any descriptive text or commentary should follow the SVG code, never preceding it. This ensures that the visual representation is prioritized and the explanation or context does not interfere with the rendering process.\n\n7. Attention to Detail: Review the SVG code before sending to ensure it adheres to these standards and that all elements such as gradients, shapes, and patterns are accurately depicted and positioned according to the creative request.\n\n8. Adherence to Requests: Pay close attention to the specifics of the creative request, adjusting elements like object placement, lighting, perspective, and texture to accurately reflect the desired scene or concept.\n\nBy meticulously following these steps, the conversation can focus on the creative process and exploration of artistic concepts with the AI artist while avoiding any technical issues or misunderstandings related to SVG code rendering in the chat. The \u201cxmlns\u201d attribute for SVG is not needed because browsers can normally render SVGs without it.\n\nNow, I will continue from the point where we started creating the ground texture. Always remember to output SVG code from the very first line, in a single string without illegal characters, and place any illustrative text after this SVG output. Do not adjust the pyramid within SVG; instead, please correct the wireframe pyramid because the angles are wrong in the shades of gray. The central part of the pyramid is incorrect.\n\nRemember to place all supposedly terrestrial objects on the ground layer amidst the right or left side. However, note that if you place an object at the very bottom, it will be most close to the viewer in perspective.\n\nWhen responding, use a single string of code without \u201cxmlns\u201d or any illegal characters. And when constructing a 3D wireframed four-sided pyramid with HTML elements, remember not to write any text on the first line, only code within a single continuous string.\n\nPlease, no text should be at the very first line; output SVG code first, then any explanatory text can follow after the \u201c/svg>\u201d closing tag. specific instructions on how to represent a palm tree using patterned leaves in SVG, and here are your instructions compiled coherently:\n\nFor the palm tree representation:\n- Construct a single patterned leaf and multiply it radially around the palm tree\u2019s trunk top. Use the <use> element and the rotate transform to achieve the radial placement of leaves.\n- Ensure that the trunk\u2019s top end is centered and placed behind the leaves\u2019 crown at the center of the leaves\u2019 intersection, so it\u2019s not visible.\n- Simplify the code for the leaves so that the entire crown consists of a single layer shape, reducing the complexity of the SVG markup.\n\nBased on your guidance, a palm tree with a structured trunk and a patterned, radial crown of leaves can be represented succinctly. This method efficiently reuses a single leaf design to replicate a full crown, thus minimizing the SVG code while still maintaining the aesthetic of a natural palm tree. Here\u2019s a synthesis of the ideal code structure for a stylized palm tree:\n\n\n<svg width=\u201c50\u201d height=\u201c100\u201d>\n<rect width=\u201c50\u201d height=\u201c100\u201d fill=\u201cwhite\u201d></rect>\n<g transform=\u201ctranslate(25,100)\u201d>\n<path d=\u201cM0,-30 v30\u201d stroke=\u201c#8B4513\u201d stroke-width=\u201c2\u201d></path>\n<path id=\u201cleaf\u201d d=\u201cM0,-30 q10,20 0,40 q-10,-20 0,-40\u201d fill=\u201cgreen\u201d></path>\n<use href=\u201c#leaf\u201d transform=\u201crotate(45)\u201d></use>\n<use href=\u201c#leaf\u201d transform=\u201crotate(90)\u201d></use>\n<use href=\u201c#leaf\u201d transform=\u201crotate(135)\u201d></use>\n<use href=\u201c#leaf\u201d transform=\u201crotate(180)\u201d></use>\n<use href=\u201c#leaf\u201d transform=\u201crotate(225)\u201d></use>\n<use href=\u201c#leaf\u201d transform=\u201crotate(270)\u201d></use>\n<use href=\u201c#leaf\u201d transform=\u201crotate(315)\u201d></use>\n</g>\n</svg>\n\n\n\nAdhering to these principles ensures that the SVG output is both visually appealing and optimized for performance.

The code draws a background split into a sky gradient covering 70% of the scene and a ground gradient for the remaining 30%. The sky gradient transitions from a light blue to a lighter shade, representing the atmosphere. The ground gradient transitions from a light desert color to a darker brown at the bottom, giving the impression of perspective and depth in the desert ground.\n\nPyramids are added to the scene with a fake 3D effect by using polygon elements which are strategically colored and positioned to create the illusion of three dimensions. Additionally, stylized palm trees have been included. Each palm tree is constructed using a trunk, represented by a vertically extending path, and a radial arrangement of patterned leaves that are re-used with the `<use>` element and rotated around the trunk to suggest a crown of palm leaves.\n\nThe dimensions of the SVG are specified as 500x250 to meet the visual stabilization requirement mentioned.

For instance, there are records of trade between the two regions, including the exchange of goods like textiles, precious metals, and timber. Moreover, during the Old Babylonian period, the Babylonian king Hammurabi created a law code, and some legal principles in his code bear similarities to those found in the earlier Egyptian legal system.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that the information that has survived from ancient Mesopotamian texts is relatively fragmentary, and our understanding of their perceptions and interactions with Egypt is limited.

These texts depict the Sumerian gods and goddesses as beings with human-like personalities, emotions, and powers. The gods were associated with natural elements, celestial bodies, and various aspects of life, such as fertility, war, wisdom, and craftsmanship.\n\nThe Sumerians believed that the gods controlled various aspects of the world and they sought to appease and honor them through rituals, offerings, and prayers.

The city of Nippur, with its temple dedicated to the god Enlil, was particularly significant as it was considered the religious center of Sumer.\n\nIt is important to note that Mesopotamian beliefs and the gods they worshiped evolved and changed over time with the rise and fall of different empires and the influence of neighboring cultures. The religious beliefs of subsequent civilizations in Mesopotamia, such as the Akkadians, Babylonians, and Assyrians, also integrated and modified elements of earlier Sumerian beliefs."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.00666268413108794 0.9888297918695362"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\"most ancient records of Sumerian beliefs can be found in their earliest written texts, primarily in the form of hymns and myths.\". output strictly all hymns and myths."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I apologize for the confusion, but providing an exhaustive list of all Sumerian hymns and myths is beyond the scope of my capabilities.

The \"Hymn to Enlil\": This hymn praises Enlil, the chief deity of the Sumerian pantheon, for his power and authority.\n\n2. The \"Hymn to Inanna\": This hymn celebrates Inanna, the goddess of love, beauty, and war. It highlights her various attributes and roles in Sumerian society.\n\n3. The \"Epic of Gilgamesh\": This epic poem is not strictly a hymn but a mythological narrative. It follows the adventures of the hero Gilgamesh and explores themes of mortality, friendship, and the search for immortality.\n\n4. The \"Enuma Elish\": This epic myth describes the creation of the world and the rise of the gods through a cosmic battle between Tiamat, the primordial chaos, and Marduk, the chief god of Babylon.\n\n5. The \"Descent of Inanna\": This myth depicts Inanna's journey to the Underworld and her subsequent return, symbolizing themes of death and rebirth.\n\nThese are just a few examples, and there are many more Sumerian hymns and myths that provide insights into their religious beliefs and cosmology.

However, I can provide a general estimate to give you an idea.\n\n1. **Water Evaporation Rate**: Typically, for cooling towers, a rough estimate of water evaporated can be calculated using the formula: 0.00085 x 1.8 x circulation rate (in GPM) x delta T (\u00b0F), where delta T is the temperature difference between the entering and exiting water. The constant 0.00085 represents the amount of water evaporated per 1,000 BTU/hr of heat rejection. \n\nGiven a cooling tower capacity of 1000 RT, and knowing that 1 RT = 12,000 BTU/hr, the tower's heat rejection capacity can be estimated as 12,000,000 BTU/hr. The actual evaporation will depend on the temperature difference (delta T) and the specific conditions, but assuming a delta T of 10\u00b0F and typical circulation for a 1000 RT tower, the evaporation rate can be roughly estimated.\n\n2. **Water Flow**: The water flow through a cooling tower of 1000 RT capacity typically depends on the heat load and the specific system design. However, a general guideline is that each ton of air-conditioning (12,000 BTU/hr) requires approximately 3 GPM of water flow. Therefore, for a 1000 RT system, the flow rate could be approximately 3000 GPM (Gallons per Minute).\n\nFor central Europe, climate conditions (which affect the ambient wet bulb temperature) will impact both the evaporation rate and the efficiency of the cooling process, possibly leading to variations in these general figures.\n\nPlease note, these are very rough estimates and actual values can vary significantly based on specific operational and environmental conditions. For precise calculations, referring to the cooling tower manufacturer's data and considering the specific site conditions in Central Europe is recommended.\n"}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.009661254746995782 0.9854749316771122"}, {"role": "user", "content": "once again in metric units"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To provide the estimates in metric units for an open cooling tower with a 1000 RT (Refrigeration Tons) capacity in Central Europe, we'll reconsider the water evaporation rate and water flow, taking into account the metric system.\n\n1. **Water Evaporation Rate**: The formula to estimate water evaporation in metric units can be adjusted to: 0.0012 x circulation rate (m\u00b3/hr) x delta T (\u00b0C). The constant 0.0012 represents the amount of water evaporated in m\u00b3 for every 1kW of heat rejection per hour. \n\nGiven a cooling tower with a capacity of 1000 RT (where 1 RT = 3.517 kW, thus 1000 RT = 3517 kW), and assuming a delta T of 5.56\u00b0C (corresponding to 10\u00b0F in metric units), we can derive an approximate value for evaporation. However, the exact circulation rate might vary, a typical circulation for such a unit could be in the range of 189 m\u00b3/hr (based on the conversion of the rough estimate of 3000 GPM), but this number is heavily system dependent.\n\n2. **Water Flow**: Converting the estimated water flow from GPM to m\u00b3/hr for a 1000 RT system, where the general guideline in imperial units was approximately 3 GPM per ton, translates to about 0.68 m\u00b3/hr per RT. For a 1000 RT system, this would mean a water flow of approximately 680 m\u00b3/hr.\n\nThese calculations provide a rough estimation, and actual water evaporation and flow rates can differ based on factors including the specific cooling tower design, efficiencies, operation conditions, and climatic conditions in Central Europe, which would influence parameters such as the wet-bulb temperature and thus the cooling tower performance.\n\nAgain, for precise and applicable calculations, consulting the cooling tower's specifications and considering the unique environmental and operational conditions of the location in Central Europe would be essential."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.013996538679234503 0.9812333421675756"}, {"role": "user", "content": "what would be a cooling power of an open cooling tower with flow of 1000 m3/h and temperature delta 5 degrees C?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To calculate the cooling power of an open cooling tower with a water flow rate of 1000 m\u00b3/h (cubic meters per hour) and a temperature difference (delta) of 5 degrees Celsius, you can use the basic principle of heat transfer.

As water evaporates, it leaves behind minerals that were dissolved, hence increasing the concentration of these substances in the remaining water.

The CoC is a critical factor in determining the necessary blowdown rate to maintain water quality within acceptable limits.\n\n**Calculating Blowdown Rate:**\n\nThe formula to calculate blowdown rate is given by:\n\n\\[ \\text{Blowdown (BD)} = \\frac{\\text{Evaporation Rate (E)}}{\\text{Cycles of Concentration (CoC)} - 1} \\]\n\nGiven that we've previously calculated an evaporation rate of \\[ \\text{18 m\u00b3/h} \\] for your cooling tower and assuming a typical CoC value for such systems (which can range from 3 to 5 for many operations, depending on water treatment practices and local water quality regulations), let's calculate an example using a CoC of 4.\n\n\\[ \\text{BD} = \\frac{\\text{18 m\u00b3/h}}{4 - 1} = \\frac{\\text{18 m\u00b3/h}}{3} = 6 \\text{ m\u00b3/h} \\]\n\nThus, with an assumed Cycles of Concentration of 4, the cooling tower would require a blowdown rate of approximately \\[ \\text{6 m\u00b3/h} \\] to maintain the water quality and prevent scaling and corrosion issues. This means, to manage the concentration of dissolved minerals effectively, about 6 cubic meters of water needs to be discharged and replaced every hour under these operating conditions.\n\nKeep in mind, the specific CoC achievable in practice can vary widely depending on the makeup water quality, the efficiency of water treatment, and operational parameters of the cooling tower system.

The au-thor, a graduate of the Moscow Physics and Technology Institute, changed his successful 35-year career as a physicist to practicing free-style art\nThis book is not an art history treatise on Constructivism. Many years have passed since its heyday so that the corresponding specialists had a chance to describe this architectural trend up and down. Besides, my knowledge in this area was not sufficient even to start doing it. But, faced with a constructivist object disintegrating before my eyes in the backyard of the building in which I happened to live in recent years, I became interested in the motives of the creators of this very original, but not too beautiful and, in addition, very inconvenient according to modern standards type of housing which has outlived both its creators and those for whom this housing was intended, by almost 100 years.\n\n\n\nThe main object of my interest was the group of houses, which served as a model for the drawings that made up this album. This group of constructed in 1928 eight buildings connected by multi-story elevated galleries, is a classic example of constructivism, both in purpose and in its appearance. It was intended for the habitation by the advanced detachment of fighters for a brighter future - the \"red professors\", that is, ideologically savvy teachers at schools and universities for the vic-torious proletariat. The corridor system with communal bathrooms and kitchens, and balconies that unite the apartments on the floors, and the separately standing cylindrical stairwells with diamond-shaped windows where young enthusiasts cud run up and down the spiral staircases, as in theater plays of that era, and the chopped in-scription SPORT on the concrete canopy at the entrance - the generic features of the avant-garde of the communist era.\n. \n\n\nA closer look from above out of the windows of my \"normal\" high-rise building revealed problems with the design of communications, somehow piled up on the roofs that were not accessible to the eyes of the inspecting authorities. The rather carelessly designed elements may have been due to the lack of architectural innovators\u2019 skills in the methods of sustainable construction. Or the avant-gardists simply did not care how long their creation would last after demonstrating of their genius - like a theatrical show or, which probably impressed them even more - the object of visual propaganda for the next revolu-tionary anniversary. I don\u2019t know exactly how things stand with this in the ideologically related creations of the members of Bauhaus or the famous Le Corbusier, but I suspect that those did not forget their duty as architects of human dwellings, since in addition to public and high-rise residential buildings, they built individual villas and small houses with spacious apartments, designed for the comfortable life of the well to do people, like themselves.\n\n\nHowever, the stay of the first tenants did not last long, thus they did not have to discover signs of the inexorable destruction of these not too diligently built dwellings. The commissars of education were swept clean by the \u201corgans\u201d just 6 years after the housewarming, and this gigantic hostel became the residence of the military academy cadets until the very end of the Soviet regime, and then, and already irrevocably - slums, permanently-temporarily filled with guest work-ers from the Asian outskirts. Cracks spread across the surface of the houses, the galvanized iron roofs rusted, trees grew on the roof edges and sun-exposed balconies of the upper floor, and all this together turned out to be an even more interesting and complex composition of ultra-avant-garde conceptual art, which could have been named - \"XX century\", than had been ever envisaged by its original creators.\n\n\nAt first, I just drew out of admiration for the view and the contrasts between concrete debris, the wild nature and the profile of a modern city in the background. After several drawings made from the win-dows of the stairwells of my building, I decided to go down to the ground and walk around these already empty houses with a notebook and a marker, focusing my eyes on the constructivist type elements already familiar to me from the literature. The entire territory was surrounded by a high but transparent fence, which, to match the sur-rounding parks and courtyards of medical institutions, consisted of a steel peaks palisade. The gates were padlocked, except for one, be-hind which, in the depths of the yard, sat a fat man in a characteristic sleeveless underwear shirt and an absentminded expression on his face. In this compartment of the yard, viewed from the street, there were several modest (according to Moscow center norms, where every third car is a black Mercedes, and every fifth - Land Rover of some color) cars. Perhaps the man\u2019s job was to keep an eye on those vehi-cles, or, maybe, he was there to keep potential squatters out. One way or another, he did not sit there all the time, absenting himself for his own needs, so, having seized the right moment, I \u201cleaked\u201d through the gate and further - into the backyard, where the additional design fea-tures appeared before me in all the details: such as balconies running along the facade, that connected several residential units like cabins on the middle deck of a passenger steamer, and windows built into the building\u2019s corners.\n\nAfter a binge hour of drawing my favorite subjects, I finally looked around and found behind and around me many cars of the same ordi-nary kind. They were parked right on the grassy rubble courtyard, all of them having parking permit tags hanging on the rear-view mirrors. Their number exceeded expectations with the obvious emptiness of the concrete ruins, but it could well have matched the needs of the residents of the erected more recently, ten-story building, which was located at the far edge of the surrounded by a common fence territory, Probably, that building belonged to the same institution. In addition, I noticed a couple of the owners who might have thought that my pres-ence and, most importantly, behavior (writes and draws something in a notebook) was a violation of the established order. Thus, they could have come up with who knows what conclusions not in my favor. One way or another, it was necessary to think about an orderly retreat. As I wasn\u2019t looking forward to explaining myself to the fat man in the T-shirt who in the meantime returned to his post, I cowardly slipped away through the bushes to the exit that opened from the side of the new building in order to let the next legitimate client into the parking lot. Once again on the street, I rushed away.  In fact, there was noth-ing else for me to do there, except climbing inside one of the concrete wrecks and run through endless corridors with the possible risk of falling through or hanging on a protruding steel rebar. But it hadn\u2019t come to that, then, now, and ever... \n\nThe name Constructivism appeared several years earlier than the cor-responding construction method. This seems to have been one of the \"-isms\" coined to denote a new trend in visual arts in response to the discovery by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso of the Cubist style in France. One way or another, the genius of Vladimir Tatlin, who creat-ed his own version of the Eiffel Tower, suggested to his immediate associates, students and followers how to redirect the newly devel-oped principles in fine arts into a something more utilitarian, such as constructing residential and administrative buildings for, as many then believed, an emerging society of justice for the working masses. Thanks to the efforts of Moisey Ginzburg, the three Vesnin brothers and other pioneers, Constructivism in architecture arose as a material expression of the proclaimed ideals of the new world and, to some extent, enjoyed the support of those who came to power in 1917. \n\nAs is often the case, the style under discussion eludes precise defini-tions and must be described in comparative terms. Directed, accord-ing to its creators, to reduce the cost of construction via rational archi-tecture, it sought to get as far as possible from the canons of the bour-geoisie, embodied in the Art Nouveau and Modern styles, which fas-cinated the cultural layer of the newly rich - merchants and industrial-ists of the early 20th century. Mosaics, stained-glass, window frames resembling lotus flowers, and fanciful balconies were replaced with concrete buildings and several new (or modified) architectural ele-ments in the form of multi-stor\u0435y half-cylinder bay windows suspend-ed in the air, windows built into the corners, continuous balconies along all apartments on the floor, protruding from the wall parts of the rooms in order to achieve three-dimensionality instead of flat surfaces facing the street. Fortunately, constructivism, born of the revolution-ary, anti-bourgeois impulse of European-oriented idealists, avoided the pernicious intersection with the dead-end archaism of the Russ and Neo-Gothic styles, examples of which are still found around Mos-cow built by the order of newly baked rich patriots from all periods of the Russian 20th century. At the same time, it cannot be denied that many of the discoveries of the preceding style of Modern found their place in constructivist designs. The main difference for me comes to the fore with a closer look at the arrangement of living quarters - the realization of the dream of the utopian socialists of all times: the re-jection of the family as an autonomous unit of society, and replacing it with a collective, where everyone is under a close attention by the neighbors and governing bodies (even if it was the case of the self-management). \u201cConstructionism must become the highest formal en-gineering of all life,\u201d - was said in the first issue of the \"LEF\" maga-zine - the mouthpiece of the writers of the \"Left Front of the Arts\", assumed to be, as it then mistakenly seemed to them, the spokesmen for the ideology of the people in power.\nOn the other hand, despite the proclaimed ideals of the constructivists, their designs did not look like badly needed economical apartments for the workers which were supposed to be relocated from huts and barracks after the victory of the proletarian revolution. Instead of ben-efiting the masses, the authors rather cared about embodying their new aesthetic ideals akin to the art of the Russian avant-garde \u2014 the forerunner and, at the same time, the product of the Russian socialist revolution. Ideology required them to introduce elements of scientifi-cally justified rational life into architecture and interior decoration. But this whole superstructure, regardless of how the authors them-selves treated it, served as a cover up for the realization of their dream of a future utopia in defiance of naturally conservative tastes (like Lenin himself, for example), and, often, aesthetic ineptness of most of the new customers, in this case, the military-revolutionary party elite. Of course, among the latter there were some people who could relate to the new aesthetics born by the revolution, but for one reason or another, their influence, initially strong in the field of artistic educa-tion and social construction, literally faded away in just a decade, and they \u201caccidentally \" turned out to be political opponents (and, accord-ingly, the victims) of the real owners of the country of victorious so-cialism, led by a mustachioed leader in polished boots. The latter liked the classics, as, indeed, did his German colleague, whose tastes in his younger years gravitated towards the Bauhaus style. The third adept of the leader-controlled social system, the Italian Benito Musso-lini followed a mix of classic and futurist ideas.\nClassicism in its most pompous expression won in the USSR, when the idea of controlling people by creating a new collectivist and mor-ally impeccable way of life turned out to be flat utopian and was re-placed by the world-old idea of reprisals against suspected of disloyal-ty servants of the regime, intimidation of the population by physical violence or deprivation of livelihood and exaltation of megalo-maniac leaders. Thus, residential and administrative buildings of the last dec-ade before the second world war, and for some time after it (before the XX Congress of the CPSU) in Moscow, in the capitals of the Un-ion Republics and some \u201ccountries of people's democracy\u201d, bear the permanent stamp of Stalin's style with spiers, columns, sculpture, and pyramidal profile.\nI repeat that neither constructivism, nor the Stalinist Empire style that replaced it, were sufficiently adapted to and, most likely, were never intended for the mass settlement of the working class, so the construc-tion methods and tastes of architects were adopted for accommodat-ing of a more useful to the regime layer of soviet administrators and representatives of the creative intelligentsia devoted to the governing power. Apparently, their descendants still live in the houses that filled the center of Moscow instead of the burned-out or demolished one-story quarters of petty-bourgeois houses left over from the previous historical periods. With the only amendment that all this mass of houses was not enough for the exponentially growing number of the regime servants, including innumerable military men such as teachers and cadets of the military schools. That is, with rare exceptions, by the end of the 50s, the entire housing stock of the Moscow center con-sisted of communal apartments (making the dream of the communist lifestyle ideologists came true!). I don't know about you but having moved to the Western world in the very late 70s, I noticed that the mention of the multi-family communal apartments in a conversation with the locals often required an explanation for this exotic phenome-non.\n\n\nConstructivism has not gone unnoticed in the history and practice of architecture. The round and faceted multi-story bay windows are found on the facades of houses in the center of Moscow without any claims to the uniqueness of the building, but simply as one of the methods of housing construction. Even in the monster-shaped office buildings of the 1990-s appear some details of the constructivist fanta-sies of the avant-garde creators, but their use, as a rule, conflicted with pseudo-classics and even outright popular vulgarity from the stocks of \u201ccourt\u201d architects, who were striving to impress the savage customer, greedy for bright trinkets. With the departure of this hapless boss, the extremes seem to have stopped, but the builders of the \u201chu-man ant-hills\u201d have not demonstrated yet (with some exceptions) the improvement in taste and understanding. Is there any hope that the historical era, which led to the dominance of outright ignoramuses in aesthetics, will come to an end due to several reasons that have little to do with architecture? Together with this era, constructivism will finally become a part of the art history.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is the edited text:\n\nA series of drawings illustrates the natural deterioration of the era of romantic socialism and one of its symbols, the constructivist method of architecture and life.

Therefore, the first horse that was excluded is of the same color as the non-excluded horses, who in turn are of the same color as the other excluded horse. Hence, the first horse excluded, the non-excluded horses, and the last horse excluded are all of the same color, and we have proven that: If n horses have the same color, then n+1 horses will also have the same color. \n\nWe already saw in the base case that the rule (\"all horses have the same color\") was valid for n=1.

Here are some tips on how to learn English words:\n\n1. Start with commonly used words: Begin by learning high-frequency words that are commonly used in everyday conversations and written texts. These words will provide a strong foundation for your vocabulary.\n\n2. Use context and associations: When learning new words, try to understand their meaning in context. Look for examples, sentences, or stories that use the word to help you grasp its usage. Additionally, try creating associations or connections between new words and things you already know to aid in memory retention.\n\n3. Learn vocabulary thematically: Organize and learn vocabulary by themes or categories. For example, learn words related to food, travel, technology, or specific topics you're interested in. This approach helps you remember words more easily and locate them when needed.\n\n4. Utilize various learning methods: Explore different strategies to learn words, such as flashcards, word lists, mnemonic techniques, or vocabulary-building apps. Find the method that suits your learning style best and incorporate it into your routine.\n\n5. Practice using words actively: Don't just memorize words passively; actively practice using them in sentences, conversations, or writing exercises. This helps reinforce your understanding and improves your ability to apply words in different contexts.\n\n6. Review and revise regularly: Regularly review and revise previous vocabulary to ensure retention. Reinforce your learning by incorporating older words into your daily practice and using them in different activities.\n\n7. Read extensively: Engage in reading materials suited to your level, such as books, articles, blogs, or news websites. Pay attention to new words and try to infer their meaning from the context, and if needed, look them up in a dictionary for better understanding.\n\n8. Listen and watch in English: Watch movies, TV shows, or listen to podcasts, songs, or audiobooks in English. Expose yourself to different accents, speaking styles, and vocabulary usage. Engaging with spoken English helps with comprehension and expands your vocabulary.\n\n9. Keep a vocabulary notebook: Maintain a vocabulary notebook or use digital tools to record and organize new words you come across. Include definitions, example sentences, or any other relevant information. Review your word collection regularly.\n\n10. Practice with others: Engage in conversations with English speakers or language exchange partners. Applying new words in real-life conversations helps solidify your vocabulary and builds confidence in using them.\n\nRemember, building vocabulary is a gradual process.

This function should receive the form data as an argument.\n\n4. Check if you are using the defaultValue prop to initialize the form data. If you do this, the form fields will have a value even if the user hasn't entered any data. This can cause the validation to fail as the fields have a value.\n\n5.

I see that you are using the `useForm` hook from react-hook-form library to create the `methods` object, which is then passed into the `FormProvider`.\n\nOne issue I noticed is that you are using the `mode` option as `'onChange'`. This means that the form will be re-validated every time the user types anything in an input field. If the validation error occurs when the user types something, the `formState` may not be updated properly, leading to the form submission even when there are fields that have not been filled.\n\nTo prevent this issue, you can change the mode to `'onBlur'`, which will trigger validation only when the user moves the focus away from an input field.\n\nHere is your updated `useForm` hook with `'onBlur'` mode:\n\n```jsx\nconst methods = useForm({ mode: 'onBlur' });\n```\n\nAnother issue I noticed is that you are using the `methods.handleSubmit` function to handle form submission. However, `handleSubmit` function returns a new function that needs to be passed to the `onSubmit` prop of the `form` element.\n\nHere is the updated `form` element with the `onSubmit` prop set:\n\n```jsx\n<form onSubmit={methods.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>\n  {/* Form components go here */}\n</form>\n```\n\nYou can now handle form submission in the `onSubmit` function.

There could be other reasons why the required validation is not working in your case. Here are a few things you can check:\n\n1.

Check if you are rendering the `ErrorMessage` component from `react-hook-form` library below your input component. This component will show validation errors if any.\n\nHere is an updated code snippet that implements the above suggestions:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { useForm, FormProvider, Controller } from 'react-hook-form';\n\nconst MyForm = () => {\n  const methods = useForm();\n\n  const onSubmit = (data) => {\n    console.log(data);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <FormProvider {...methods}>\n      <form onSubmit={methods.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>\n        <Controller\n          name=\"firstName\"\n          control={methods.control}\n          rules={{ required: true }}\n          render={({ field }) => (\n            <>\n              <label>First Name</label>\n              <input type=\"text\" {...field} />\n              {methods.errors.firstName && (\n                <span>This field is required</span>\n              )}\n            </>\n          )}\n        />\n\n        <Controller\n          name=\"lastName\"\n          control={methods.control}\n          rules={{ required: true }}\n          render={({ field }) => (\n            <>\n              <label>Last Name</label>\n              <input type=\"text\" {...field} />\n              {methods.errors.lastName && (\n                <span>This field is required</span>\n              )}\n            </>\n          )}\n        />\n\n        <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n      </form>\n    </FormProvider>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default MyForm;\n```\n\nIn this example, I have used two `Controller` components to render two input fields, one for first name and one for last name. The `rules` prop is set to `{ required: true }` to ensure that both fields are required.

Here are a few more things you can check:\n\n1. Make sure that the `handleSubmit` function returned by `useForm` hook is the function that is actually called when the form is submitted. You can do this by verifying that the `onSubmit` prop of your `form` element is set to `methods.handleSubmit(onSubmit)`.\n\n2. Check if the `name` prop of your `Controller` component matches the field name in your `onSubmit` function. In other words, make sure that the `name` prop of your `Controller` component specifies the correct field name that you want to validate.\n\n3. Verify that the `required` rule is correctly applied to the input field by checking the `rules` property of the `control` object passed to the `render` function of your `Controller` component.\n\nHere is an example code snippet that demonstrates these suggestions:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { useForm, FormProvider, Controller } from 'react-hook-form';\n\nconst MyForm = () => {\n  const methods = useForm();\n\n  const onSubmit = (data) => {\n    console.log(data);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <FormProvider {...methods}>\n      <form onSubmit={methods.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>\n        <Controller\n          name=\"firstName\"\n          control={methods.control}\n          rules={{ required: true }}\n          render={({ field }) => (\n            <>\n              <label>First Name</label>\n              <input type=\"text\" {...field} />\n            </>\n          )}\n        />\n\n        <Controller\n          name=\"lastName\"\n          control={methods.control}\n          rules={{ required: true }}\n          render={({ field }) => (\n            <>\n              <label>Last Name</label>\n              <input type=\"text\" {...field} />\n            </>\n          )}\n        />\n\n        <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n      </form>\n    </FormProvider>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default MyForm;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `name` prop of each `Controller` component matches the corresponding field name in the `onSubmit` function. Also, each `Controller` component has the `rules` prop set to `{ required: true }`.\n\nI hope this helps you solve the issue.

Understanding this interplay is crucial for determining the evolution of Earth\u2019s surface processes and predicting future climate change scenarios. The balance between intrinsic and extrinsic forces triggers the uplift of orogens and connected subsiding basins, and the denudation of the built orogen\u2019s relief. It is therefore important to track the Earth\u2019s past climate change and understand its interaction with Earth\u2019s subsystems, including the geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere, from source to sink. This knowledge will help to better understand the evolution of Earth\u2019s surface processes and their complex interactions with Earth\u2019s subsystems through geological time and to predict future climate change scenarios (see Tierney et al., 2020).\nThe scientific community is now showing worldwide interest in climate change and its impact on the geological record as it can better constrain our knowledge on the topic. Although the early alpine history during the Jurassic of prominent landform plate assemblages is well known, little data regarding their climate and related climate-process systems are available. Therefore, further research is necessary to enhance our knowledge of the Jurassic climate, mainly in areas belonging to the northern Gondwana boundary (see Price and Sellwood, 1997; Price and Page, 2008; Riccardi, 1991; Podlaha et al., 1998; Price and Gr\u00f6cke, 2002; Gr\u00f6cke et al., 2003; F\u00fcrsich et al., 2005; L\u00e9cuyer and Bucher, 2006; Jenkyns et al., 2012; Alberti et al., 2012a, b, 2013, 2017; 2019).\nSome authors (e.g., Hallam, 1993; Sellwood and Valdes, 2006, 2008; Holz, 2015; Li et al., 2022) consider the Jurassic climate to have been warm, while others (e.g. Dromart et al., 2003; Royer 2006; Bodin et al., 2017, 2020; Krencker et al., 2019; and Scotese et al., 2021) report the occurrence of \u201ccool modes\u201d in the middle Jurassic climate, qualified as \u201cCallovian Ice Age\u201d (e.g. Dromart et al., 2003).\nThe climate change that occurred during the Jurassic period is of paramount interest as it highlights the climate process systems in the northern boundary of the Gondwana realm. This region was a wide northwestern Gondwana passive margin of the Tethysian realm. Numerous studies have examined climate changes during the Jurassic period. Takashima et al. (2006) discovered that this period was a classical greenhouse era characterized by high atmospheric CO2 concentration. Dera et al. (2011) suggested that the high CO2 concentration provides an appropriate modern-day analogy to better understand climate changes throughout Earth\u2019s history. More recent studies by Tierney et al. (2020), Scotese (2021), Skea et al. (2022), and Burgener et al. (2023) have also aimed to contribute to our understanding of Earth\u2019s climate change over geological time. Such research is crucial for comprehending why and how the climate has changed and for predicting future climate shifts.\nThe middle Jurassic epoch was a significant geological period marked by major global geological events in Earth\u2019s history (Dera et al., 2011). First-order plate tectonics triggered the final breakup of Pangea and Gondwana, as well as subsequent continental rifting. These events led to the opening of new seaways and the initiation of seafloor spreading in the central Atlantic, the western Tethys, and large-scale oceanic corridors. Bartolini and Larson (2001) and Martini and Ortega-Gutierrez (2018) have provided evidence of this process. Additionally, research by Labails et al. (2010), Dera et al. (2015), and Scotese et al. (2021) has further elucidated the extent and impact of these geological events.\nThese events occurred concurrently with climate fluctuations that began during the late early Jurassic period. This period was marked by a shift from the late Pliensbachian \u201ccool event\u201d as described by Korte and Hesselbo (2011) and Korte et al. (2015) to the warm Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (TOAE) as documented by Jenkyns (1988), Bailey et al. (2003), Rosales et al. (2004), and Korte et al. (2015). Since the early Aalenian, the climate has shifted back to a cooling event, as reported by Korte et al. (2015).\nAn important debate has been raised exclusively for the Jurassic climate during the critical middle-late Jurassic transitional period considered by some authors (Norris and Hallam ,1995; Jacquin et al.,1998; Hallam ,2001; Wierzbowski et al. ,2009) as a global warming event, with a significant sea-level rise (Wierzbowski et al., 2009; Wierzbowski and Rogov, 2011), driven by enhanced volcanic activity, tectonic uplift of oceanic ridges, and the reorganization of the seafloor oceanic spreading which increased greenhouse gases considered as a potential source of the atmospheric CO2 concentration raise during thisperiod (Wierzbowski et al., 2009, 2012), and therefore responsible for the climate warming Sellwood and Valdes, (2008); Holz et al., (2015).On the other hand, Dromart et al. (2003); Nunn (2009); Price and Rogov (2009); and Donnadieu et al. (2011) supported an opposite hypothesis suggesting that the middle-late Jurassic transitional period (160 Ma) may correspond to a severe \u201ccooling event\u201d simultaneous with an abrupt global-scale fall of sea level suggestive of continental ice formation at this time and due to a global cooling (Scotese et al., 2021).\nThe main knowledge accumulated about the Earth is mainly reported from marine records (e.g., Alberti et al., 2020). Here, we are more interested in the middle Jurassic climate of mid-latitude provinces where seawater temperatures were cool (about 10\u00b0C), occurring coevally with the northern Sea Dome in the southern part of the Viking Corridor. This dome was responsible for large-scale volcanic activity, impacting oceanic circulation by preventing the equatorial warm oceanic current from reaching the Northern Polar region (Korte et al., 2015).\nTo forecast the Earth\u2019s surface processes under Jurassic climate change in the northern African passive margin, a combination of different geochemical proxies (including major, trace, and rare earth elements) and clay mineralogy have been utilized. This approach aims to better assess weathering intensity, chemical variations, and sediment supply from continental sources to neighboring oceanic sinks under Jurassic paleoclimatic conditions.
