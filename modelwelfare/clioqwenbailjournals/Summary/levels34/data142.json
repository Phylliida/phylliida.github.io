The au-thor, a graduate of the Moscow Physics and Technology Institute, changed his successful 35-year career as a physicist to practicing free-style art\nThis book is not an art history treatise on Constructivism. Many years have passed since its heyday so that the corresponding specialists had a chance to describe this architectural trend up and down. Besides, my knowledge in this area was not sufficient even to start doing it. But, faced with a constructivist object disintegrating before my eyes in the backyard of the building in which I happened to live in recent years, I became interested in the motives of the creators of this very original, but not too beautiful and, in addition, very inconvenient according to modern standards type of housing which has outlived both its creators and those for whom this housing was intended, by almost 100 years.\n\n\n\nThe main object of my interest was the group of houses, which served as a model for the drawings that made up this album. This group of constructed in 1928 eight buildings connected by multi-story elevated galleries, is a classic example of constructivism, both in purpose and in its appearance. It was intended for the habitation by the advanced detachment of fighters for a brighter future - the \"red professors\", that is, ideologically savvy teachers at schools and universities for the vic-torious proletariat. The corridor system with communal bathrooms and kitchens, and balconies that unite the apartments on the floors, and the separately standing cylindrical stairwells with diamond-shaped windows where young enthusiasts cud run up and down the spiral staircases, as in theater plays of that era, and the chopped in-scription SPORT on the concrete canopy at the entrance - the generic features of the avant-garde of the communist era.\n. \n\n\nA closer look from above out of the windows of my \"normal\" high-rise building revealed problems with the design of communications, somehow piled up on the roofs that were not accessible to the eyes of the inspecting authorities. The rather carelessly designed elements may have been due to the lack of architectural innovators\u2019 skills in the methods of sustainable construction. Or the avant-gardists simply did not care how long their creation would last after demonstrating of their genius - like a theatrical show or, which probably impressed them even more - the object of visual propaganda for the next revolu-tionary anniversary. I don\u2019t know exactly how things stand with this in the ideologically related creations of the members of Bauhaus or the famous Le Corbusier, but I suspect that those did not forget their duty as architects of human dwellings, since in addition to public and high-rise residential buildings, they built individual villas and small houses with spacious apartments, designed for the comfortable life of the well to do people, like themselves.\n\n\nHowever, the stay of the first tenants did not last long, thus they did not have to discover signs of the inexorable destruction of these not too diligently built dwellings. The commissars of education were swept clean by the \u201corgans\u201d just 6 years after the housewarming, and this gigantic hostel became the residence of the military academy cadets until the very end of the Soviet regime, and then, and already irrevocably - slums, permanently-temporarily filled with guest work-ers from the Asian outskirts. Cracks spread across the surface of the houses, the galvanized iron roofs rusted, trees grew on the roof edges and sun-exposed balconies of the upper floor, and all this together turned out to be an even more interesting and complex composition of ultra-avant-garde conceptual art, which could have been named - \"XX century\", than had been ever envisaged by its original creators.\n\n\nAt first, I just drew out of admiration for the view and the contrasts between concrete debris, the wild nature and the profile of a modern city in the background. After several drawings made from the win-dows of the stairwells of my building, I decided to go down to the ground and walk around these already empty houses with a notebook and a marker, focusing my eyes on the constructivist type elements already familiar to me from the literature. The entire territory was surrounded by a high but transparent fence, which, to match the sur-rounding parks and courtyards of medical institutions, consisted of a steel peaks palisade. The gates were padlocked, except for one, be-hind which, in the depths of the yard, sat a fat man in a characteristic sleeveless underwear shirt and an absentminded expression on his face. In this compartment of the yard, viewed from the street, there were several modest (according to Moscow center norms, where every third car is a black Mercedes, and every fifth - Land Rover of some color) cars. Perhaps the man\u2019s job was to keep an eye on those vehi-cles, or, maybe, he was there to keep potential squatters out. One way or another, he did not sit there all the time, absenting himself for his own needs, so, having seized the right moment, I \u201cleaked\u201d through the gate and further - into the backyard, where the additional design fea-tures appeared before me in all the details: such as balconies running along the facade, that connected several residential units like cabins on the middle deck of a passenger steamer, and windows built into the building\u2019s corners.\n\nAfter a binge hour of drawing my favorite subjects, I finally looked around and found behind and around me many cars of the same ordi-nary kind. They were parked right on the grassy rubble courtyard, all of them having parking permit tags hanging on the rear-view mirrors. Their number exceeded expectations with the obvious emptiness of the concrete ruins, but it could well have matched the needs of the residents of the erected more recently, ten-story building, which was located at the far edge of the surrounded by a common fence territory, Probably, that building belonged to the same institution. In addition, I noticed a couple of the owners who might have thought that my pres-ence and, most importantly, behavior (writes and draws something in a notebook) was a violation of the established order. Thus, they could have come up with who knows what conclusions not in my favor. One way or another, it was necessary to think about an orderly retreat. As I wasn\u2019t looking forward to explaining myself to the fat man in the T-shirt who in the meantime returned to his post, I cowardly slipped away through the bushes to the exit that opened from the side of the new building in order to let the next legitimate client into the parking lot. Once again on the street, I rushed away.  In fact, there was noth-ing else for me to do there, except climbing inside one of the concrete wrecks and run through endless corridors with the possible risk of falling through or hanging on a protruding steel rebar. But it hadn\u2019t come to that, then, now, and ever... \n\nThe name Constructivism appeared several years earlier than the cor-responding construction method. This seems to have been one of the \"-isms\" coined to denote a new trend in visual arts in response to the discovery by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso of the Cubist style in France. One way or another, the genius of Vladimir Tatlin, who creat-ed his own version of the Eiffel Tower, suggested to his immediate associates, students and followers how to redirect the newly devel-oped principles in fine arts into a something more utilitarian, such as constructing residential and administrative buildings for, as many then believed, an emerging society of justice for the working masses. Thanks to the efforts of Moisey Ginzburg, the three Vesnin brothers and other pioneers, Constructivism in architecture arose as a material expression of the proclaimed ideals of the new world and, to some extent, enjoyed the support of those who came to power in 1917. \n\nAs is often the case, the style under discussion eludes precise defini-tions and must be described in comparative terms. Directed, accord-ing to its creators, to reduce the cost of construction via rational archi-tecture, it sought to get as far as possible from the canons of the bour-geoisie, embodied in the Art Nouveau and Modern styles, which fas-cinated the cultural layer of the newly rich - merchants and industrial-ists of the early 20th century. Mosaics, stained-glass, window frames resembling lotus flowers, and fanciful balconies were replaced with concrete buildings and several new (or modified) architectural ele-ments in the form of multi-stor\u0435y half-cylinder bay windows suspend-ed in the air, windows built into the corners, continuous balconies along all apartments on the floor, protruding from the wall parts of the rooms in order to achieve three-dimensionality instead of flat surfaces facing the street. Fortunately, constructivism, born of the revolution-ary, anti-bourgeois impulse of European-oriented idealists, avoided the pernicious intersection with the dead-end archaism of the Russ and Neo-Gothic styles, examples of which are still found around Mos-cow built by the order of newly baked rich patriots from all periods of the Russian 20th century. At the same time, it cannot be denied that many of the discoveries of the preceding style of Modern found their place in constructivist designs. The main difference for me comes to the fore with a closer look at the arrangement of living quarters - the realization of the dream of the utopian socialists of all times: the re-jection of the family as an autonomous unit of society, and replacing it with a collective, where everyone is under a close attention by the neighbors and governing bodies (even if it was the case of the self-management). \u201cConstructionism must become the highest formal en-gineering of all life,\u201d - was said in the first issue of the \"LEF\" maga-zine - the mouthpiece of the writers of the \"Left Front of the Arts\", assumed to be, as it then mistakenly seemed to them, the spokesmen for the ideology of the people in power.\nOn the other hand, despite the proclaimed ideals of the constructivists, their designs did not look like badly needed economical apartments for the workers which were supposed to be relocated from huts and barracks after the victory of the proletarian revolution. Instead of ben-efiting the masses, the authors rather cared about embodying their new aesthetic ideals akin to the art of the Russian avant-garde \u2014 the forerunner and, at the same time, the product of the Russian socialist revolution. Ideology required them to introduce elements of scientifi-cally justified rational life into architecture and interior decoration. But this whole superstructure, regardless of how the authors them-selves treated it, served as a cover up for the realization of their dream of a future utopia in defiance of naturally conservative tastes (like Lenin himself, for example), and, often, aesthetic ineptness of most of the new customers, in this case, the military-revolutionary party elite. Of course, among the latter there were some people who could relate to the new aesthetics born by the revolution, but for one reason or another, their influence, initially strong in the field of artistic educa-tion and social construction, literally faded away in just a decade, and they \u201caccidentally \" turned out to be political opponents (and, accord-ingly, the victims) of the real owners of the country of victorious so-cialism, led by a mustachioed leader in polished boots. The latter liked the classics, as, indeed, did his German colleague, whose tastes in his younger years gravitated towards the Bauhaus style. The third adept of the leader-controlled social system, the Italian Benito Musso-lini followed a mix of classic and futurist ideas.\nClassicism in its most pompous expression won in the USSR, when the idea of controlling people by creating a new collectivist and mor-ally impeccable way of life turned out to be flat utopian and was re-placed by the world-old idea of reprisals against suspected of disloyal-ty servants of the regime, intimidation of the population by physical violence or deprivation of livelihood and exaltation of megalo-maniac leaders. Thus, residential and administrative buildings of the last dec-ade before the second world war, and for some time after it (before the XX Congress of the CPSU) in Moscow, in the capitals of the Un-ion Republics and some \u201ccountries of people's democracy\u201d, bear the permanent stamp of Stalin's style with spiers, columns, sculpture, and pyramidal profile.\nI repeat that neither constructivism, nor the Stalinist Empire style that replaced it, were sufficiently adapted to and, most likely, were never intended for the mass settlement of the working class, so the construc-tion methods and tastes of architects were adopted for accommodat-ing of a more useful to the regime layer of soviet administrators and representatives of the creative intelligentsia devoted to the governing power. Apparently, their descendants still live in the houses that filled the center of Moscow instead of the burned-out or demolished one-story quarters of petty-bourgeois houses left over from the previous historical periods. With the only amendment that all this mass of houses was not enough for the exponentially growing number of the regime servants, including innumerable military men such as teachers and cadets of the military schools. That is, with rare exceptions, by the end of the 50s, the entire housing stock of the Moscow center con-sisted of communal apartments (making the dream of the communist lifestyle ideologists came true!). I don't know about you but having moved to the Western world in the very late 70s, I noticed that the mention of the multi-family communal apartments in a conversation with the locals often required an explanation for this exotic phenome-non.\n\n\nConstructivism has not gone unnoticed in the history and practice of architecture. The round and faceted multi-story bay windows are found on the facades of houses in the center of Moscow without any claims to the uniqueness of the building, but simply as one of the methods of housing construction. Even in the monster-shaped office buildings of the 1990-s appear some details of the constructivist fanta-sies of the avant-garde creators, but their use, as a rule, conflicted with pseudo-classics and even outright popular vulgarity from the stocks of \u201ccourt\u201d architects, who were striving to impress the savage customer, greedy for bright trinkets. With the departure of this hapless boss, the extremes seem to have stopped, but the builders of the \u201chu-man ant-hills\u201d have not demonstrated yet (with some exceptions) the improvement in taste and understanding. Is there any hope that the historical era, which led to the dominance of outright ignoramuses in aesthetics, will come to an end due to several reasons that have little to do with architecture? Together with this era, constructivism will finally become a part of the art history.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is the edited text:\n\nA series of drawings illustrates the natural deterioration of the era of romantic socialism and one of its symbols, the constructivist method of architecture and life.

During the month of May, soft landing dynamics returned , as US economic data surprised to the upside,  while recent fears around US debt ceiling risks and further fallout from the regional banking crisis did not materialize. As a result, broader rate complexes sold off , including real rates , as the market unwound most of the implied rate cuts through the end of 2023 that was priced at the end of April. Breakeven valuations however continue to remain at the cheaper end of its narrow range, with forward recession concerns weighing on sentiment, and industry outflows remaining a negative technical headwind.  Real yields across the curve rose during the month, with the front end leading the move higher, with 1yr yields crossing the 3% handle and back end real rates approaching 2022 highs.  The TIPS index posted a negative monthly return of -1.19% for the month,  brining the YTD returns to 2.26%\nFor the inflation data, the April CPI release helped with the soft-landing narrative, as headline and core inflation broadly came inline with market expectations of 0.40% mom for both series, while Powell\u2019s closely watched super-core category fell sharply from 0.40% mom March to 0.11% in April, bringing the 3-month average to 0.34%. The decline was not as optimistic under the surface though, as the weaker inflation was led by outsized slowdowns in travel-related subcomponents, namely Hotels and Public Transportation which tends to be more volatile. The remaining subcomponents in the index either accelerated or stayed flat in April, suggesting underlying stickiness to the inflation picture.  Rent & OER also bounced back from the sharp deceleration in March (0.56% and 0.54% MoM respectively, up from 0.49% and 0.48%. Overall, the slowdown in inflationary pressures is a welcome relief and favorable base effects will result in further sigifnacnt drop in headline yoy rates (expected Headline CPI falling from 4.9% to 4.1%).  On the flip side, core inflation remains sticky, with market-based fixing and Cleveland Fed nowcast projecting a robust +0.45bp for the May release. \nFor Fed policy, recent communication from core members of the committee suggest a June skip for rate policy to allow them time to assess the incoming data and the impact of the credit tightening on economic activity.  Any pause should not be interpreted as peak terminal however, as the Fed continue to stress data dependency and the potential need to do more given the tightness of the labor market and slow progress on brining down inflation. As such, the markets are currently pricing in 80% of a hike in July, compared to implied rate cuts just a month ago. \nStrategy/Outlook:\nThe TIPS markets continue to be challenged with various headwinds in the current environment. Downside risks emanating from the evolving bank stresses and tightening credit and monetary conditions have reduced investor appetite for the asset class. Flow technicals remain negative on the year and over the last 12months, as both ETF and mutual fund flows have continued to see outflows in the industry. Valuations remain on the cheaper end of the range,  in particular the front end of the breakeven curve, but muted risk appetite from the real money community and retail outflows suggest even cheaper vallations are needed to entice buyers to compensate for the inherent risk / illiquidity premium of the product at the moment. Overall, we view TIPS being mired in the current range for the time being, as the market continue to oscillate between regimes. \n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here are some minor proofreading corrections:\n\n- \"the shifting dance between soft and hard landing scenarios\" -> \"the shifting balance between soft and hard landing scenarios\"\n- \"soft landing dynamics returned\" -> \"soft landing conditions returned\"\n- \"Breakeven valuations however continue to remain at the cheaper end\" -> \"However, breakeven valuations continue to remain at the cheaper end\"\n- \"with forward recession concerns weighing on sentiment\" -> \"with concerns of a future recession weighing on sentiment\"\n- \"bringing the YTD returns to 2.26%\" -> \"bringing YTD returns to 2.26%\"\n- \"as headline and core inflation broadly came inline with\" -> \"as headline and core inflation broadly came in line with\"\n- \"tends to be more volatile\" -> \"is known for being more volatile\"\n- \"The remaining subcomponents in the index either accelerated\" -> \"The remaining subcomponents in the index either accelerated or remained flat\"\n- \"as peak terminal\" -> \"as the peak terminal\"\n- \"for the asset class\" -> \"for this asset class\"\n- \"in the industry\" -> \"in this industry\"\n- \"but muted risk appetite from the real money community\" -> \"but a muted risk appetite among the real money community\"\n\nOverall, the text is well-written and clear."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.04178047687635017 0.9509192104415954"}]}]}], "numConvs": 6}
