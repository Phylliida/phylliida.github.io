Here's how to do it:\n\n   - Open the Start menu and search for \"Advanced System Settings\". Click on \"View advanced system settings\".\n  \n   - In the System Properties window, go to the \"Advanced\" tab and click on the \"Environment Variables\" button.\n  \n   - Under \"System Variables\", find the \"Path\" variable and click on \"Edit\".\n  \n   - Add the path to the Maven bin folder to the list of paths.

Be sure to separate paths with a semicolon (;).\n  \n   - Click \"OK\" to close all the windows.\n\n4. Test the mvn command: Open a new command prompt and run the \"mvn\" command again. You should see Maven start up and display its version information. If you see this information, then the \"mvn\" command should work properly now. \n\n5.
