Thanks to this, we can individually adjust the drug to your preferences or the strength of addiction.\nIt is important to determine the appropriate initial dose of nicotine delivered to the body and the correct plan for its gradual reduction. Taking too low a dose or too fast a reduction rate will lead to withdrawal symptoms and an increased desire to reach for a cigarette, which may be the reason for stopping abstinence. However, a dose that is too high or the rate of reduction too slow will maintain a high demand for nicotine and addiction will persist.\nNicotine gum\nThe first readily available NRT product was nicotine gum. It comes in 2 and 4 mg doses. Studies have shown that 4mg chewing gum has a higher withdrawal success rate compared to 2mg. [12]\nThe initial dose should be determined individually depending on the degree of nicotine dependence. Typically, 8-12 gums with the appropriate nicotine content per day are used. Highly dependent smokers (Fagerstr\u00f6m nicotine dependence score greater than 6 or smoking more than 20 cigarettes per day) or those who have not stopped smoking after using 2 mg gum should start treatment with 4 mg. Do not use more than 24 gums per day.\nChew the gum slowly until you feel the taste, then stop chewing and keep the gum between the gum and the cheek. Start chewing again when the taste wears off. This operation should be repeated for 30 minutes.\nThe gum should be used for at least 3 months. Then you should start to gradually reduce the amount of gum you take. Treatment should be stopped when the dose is reduced to 1-2 gums per day. [13]\nNicotine tablets\nLike nicotine gum, nicotine from the lozenge is slowly absorbed by the buccal mucosa and delivered to the systemic circulation. The lozenge is an alternative to gum for people who need intermittent and controlled nicotine dosing, but cannot accept chewing gum.\nThey are available as 1.5, 2 and 4 mg. The preparation at a dose of 1.5 mg is intended for people who smoke less than 20 cigarettes a day, and at a dose of 4 mg - who smoke more than 20 cigarettes a day.\nTablets should be used for 6 weeks, and then gradually reduce their number. Treatment should be discontinued when 1-2 tablets are taken daily. They can be used after the end of therapy, when there is a strong desire to smoke a cigarette. [14]\nNicotine patches\nThe nicotine patch is a transdermal patch that is easy to use and has a slow release of nicotine. They are available in doses of 21mg, 14mg and 7mg/24h. They should be placed on hairless, clean, dry and healthy skin. The patch should be applied once a day, preferably in the morning immediately after waking up. Plasma nicotine levels rise more slowly throughout the day with the use of the nicotine patch than with any other NRT (nicotine gum, spray, lozenges, and inhalers). The maximum plasma concentration is reached 8-10 hours after the start of administration. Patients may experience side effects in the form of insomnia, and local skin irritation may also occur. [15]\nNicotine oral inhaler\nThe nicotine inhaler consists of a mouthpiece and a plastic cartridge containing nicotine that mimics a cigarette. It can be sprayed in the mouth (do not inhale or swallow it for a few seconds). It is important not to touch his mouth.\nApplication diagram:\nWeek 1-6 - 1 or 2 doses of the preparation when the desire to smoke a cigarette or nicotine craving occurs; repeat after a few minutes if necessary\nWeek 7-9 - start reducing the number of doses per day, by the end of week 9, the patient should use half of the average number of doses used in step 1\nWeeks 10-12 - continue to reduce the number of doses taken per day so that no more than 4 doses per day are taken at week 12.\nWhen the number of doses per day is reduced to 2-4, the use of the preparation should be discontinued. [16]\nAbsorption of nicotine is about 36% in the mouth, esophagus, stomach and about (4%) in the lungs. The rate of absorption through the inhaler is the same as that of nicotine gum, which occurs mainly through the oral mucosa. Its use can lead to irritation of the mouth and throat. [17]\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "By averaging the efficacy of different forms of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), approximately 20% of participants achieve six months of abstinence from smoking using this method [11].\n\nEach NRT medication has different nicotine doses, allowing for individual adjustment based on preferences or the level of addiction.\n\nIt is crucial to determine the appropriate initial nicotine dose and create a gradual reduction plan. Taking too low of a dose or reducing too quickly can lead to withdrawal symptoms and increased cravings for cigarettes, potentially causing a relapse. Conversely, a dose that is too high or a slow reduction rate will maintain a high nicotine demand and perpetuate the addiction.\n\nNicotine gum was the first commercially available NRT product. It is available in 2 mg and 4 mg doses. Studies indicate that 4 mg chewing gum has a higher success rate for overcoming withdrawal compared to the 2 mg gum [12].\n\nThe initial dose of nicotine gum should be determined individually based on nicotine dependence. Typically, 8-12 gums with the appropriate nicotine content are used per day. Highly dependent smokers (with a Fagerstr\u00f6m nicotine dependence score greater than 6 or those who smoke more than 20 cigarettes per day) or individuals who have not successfully quit smoking with 2 mg gum should begin treatment with 4 mg gum. It is advised not to exceed 24 gums per day.\n\nThe gum should be chewed slowly until the taste is felt, then chewing should be stopped, and the gum should be placed between the gum and cheek. Chewing can be resumed when the taste diminishes. This process should be repeated for 30 minutes.\n\nThe gum should be used for a minimum of 3 months, followed by a gradual reduction in use.

Side effects may include insomnia and local skin irritation [15].\n\nThe nicotine inhaler consists of a mouthpiece and a plastic cartridge containing nicotine, simulating a cigarette. It is to be sprayed into the mouth without inhaling or swallowing and should not touch the lips.\n\nApplication schedule:\n- Weeks 1-6: Use 1 or 2 doses of the inhaler whenever there is a desire to smoke or nicotine craving, repeat after a few minutes if necessary.\n- Weeks 7-9: Start reducing the number of daily doses, aiming to use half of the average number of doses used in step 1 by the end of week 9.\n- Weeks 10-12: Continue reducing the number of daily doses so that by week 12, no more than 4 doses are taken per day.\nWhen the number of doses per day is reduced to 2-4, the use of the inhaler should be discontinued [16].\n\nApproximately 36% of nicotine is absorbed in the mouth, esophagus, stomach, while around 4% is absorbed in the lungs.
