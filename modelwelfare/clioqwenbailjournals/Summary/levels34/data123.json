Conspicuously, the number of this family members has been found to exhibit variation across different species. In current study, 20 AA9 genes were recognized from T. fergusii genome. These AA9 categorized into 3 subgroups, including LPMOs1, LPMOs2, and LPMOs3 which were analogous to the AA9 genes in C. thermophilum and N. crassa genomnes (Galagan et al., 2003; Hegnar et al., 2021; Li et al., 2020). The evolutionary relationships among the T. fergusii (TfAA9) and the model organisms C. thermophilum (CtAA9), N. crassa (NcAA9), and T. reesei (TrAA9) were established using a comparative study. The findings demonstrated that TfAA9 shares the same domain composition as the other three model fungi (Figure 1). The evolutionary tree was partitioned into three distinct subgroups, and our findings align with a previously conducted study on AA9 in C. thermophilum (Li et al., 2020). The motif composition analysis also demonstrated that motifs 1\u20136 were common with highly conserved nature. The functional characterisation of LPMOs AA9 motifs has not been optimised to the present time. Motifs 1, 2, and 7 exhibited an abundance of His residues, whereas Motifs 1, 3, 8, and 12 were characterized by a predominance of Tyrosine residues. Previous research has indicated that these motifs may potentially serve as significant active sites for lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs), given the significance of His and Tyr residues in copper (Cu) metal binding sites (Ciano et al., 2018).  Moreover, the Conserved domain analysis showed that same AA9 domain was prsented in all 20 TfAA9 genes consistent with the many other fungi (Grieco et al., 2020; T\u00f5lgo et al., 2022). These findings suggest the presence of potential structural diversification within the TfAA9 gene family, which is known to have a significant impact on the evolutionary process of multi-gene families."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this recent study, the AA9 gene family was investigated in various fungi, revealing variations in the number of family members across different species.

Endoglucanase activity, Cellulase activity, protein concentration and functional secretome analysis indicated that avicel was a good inducer of endoglucanases and cellulases secreted by T. fergusii (Figure 12). Endoglucanase activity results were similar to C. thermophilum but cellulase activity results were different to P. chrysosporium (Li et al., 2020; Machado et al., 2020). The insoluble crystalline substrate avicel specifcally induced the effecient secretion of cellulose-degrading enzymes by T. fergusii, which was similar to the model fungus C. thermophilum and N. crassa (Li et al., 2020; Phillips, Iavarone, & Marletta, 2011). T. fergusii gene expansion probably reflects the adaptability of the fungus to the substrate because a thermophilic fungus genome encodes more LPMOs gene. Compared to the cellobiose a carbon sources, biomass on Avicel was lower, which was similar to the Thielavia terrestris LPH172 and Malbranchea cinnamomea poor growth performance on avicel (Figure 12 B) (H\u00fcttner et al., 2017; T\u00f5lgo et al., 2021). Probably poor growth performance was due to the crystal nature of avicel. Growth discrepancies between the two T. terrestris strains LPH172 and CBS 117535 corroborate previously reported differences in biomass degradation and enzyme production between strains of the same species. This was mainly attributed to the postgenomic and regulatory diferences between strains. Differential gene expression analysis helped to suggest the main enzymes involved in degradation of tested substrates. The range of upregulated LPMOs AA9 genes encoding cellulase was perhaps more diverse than expected on all 3 substrates (Avicel, cellobiose and glucose) but the ratio of up-reugulated gene was more high on avicel (Figure 13). Similarly several AA9 genes of T. terrestris strains LPH172, LPMOs1 genes of  C. thermophilum and N. crassa wild type strain genes encoding lignocellulolytic were upregulated on avicel (Li et al., 2020; T\u00f5lgo et al., 2021; Znameroski et al., 2012).

Research findings have indicated that these many loops comprise the surface responsible for binding substrates (Figures 2a). The oxidation regioselectivity of a given substrate is attributed to the active site architecture of a LPMO (Vu, Beeson, Phillips, Cate, & Marletta, 2014; Zhou, Qi, Huang, & Zhu, 2019). Another some special feature of LPMOs2 like the serine (S) residue before the H-103 and along with the S-99 another 9-14 aa loop considered to be active sites (Figures 2a and Figure S1). The crystal structures of NCU01050, NCU07898, and Ta_GH61A reveal that the S hydroxyl group is situated on the surface of the active site, potentially facilitating interactions with the cellulose substrate (Vu et al., 2014). The alignment of the aromatic side chain of residue Y24 with the active site surface indicates that Y24 could potentially play a crucial role in the oxidation of C4 by LPMOs3 (Figures 2a) (Vu et al., 2014). By employing structural and sequence alignments, It was successfully discovered the characteristics present on the active site surface that are expected to play a role in precisely adjusting the positioning of the copper active site on the cellulose surface, thereby enabling regioselective hydroxylation (Vu et al., 2014). In the meantime, a considerable multitude of LPMOs sequences exhibiting significant diversity have been discovered. However, the characterization of enzyme activities and structures associated with LPMOs remains limited, impeding our comprehension of the intricate connection between their structural attributes and functional properties.\nThe protein-protein interaction network of a specific gene family serves as empirical support for the interconnections among its constituent proteins. The protein-protein interaction results of TfAA9 proteins exhibited that 12 TfAA9 proteins were homologous with M. thermophila (MtAA9) and displayed strong intearction with each other (Figure 4). A previous study has indicated that the nine MtAA9 genes, that encode LPMOs, play a dynamic role in the auxiliary activity family 9, which is associated with the process of cellulose decomposition (Q. Liu et al., 2019). The findings of this study suggest that the TfAA9 proteins may possess a shared characteristic of cellulose degradation, compared to the MtAA9 proteins..\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The catalytic domains of LPMOs exhibit similar \u03b2-sandwich core structures, but the loops beyond these structures show significant diversity, which is responsible for substrate binding.
