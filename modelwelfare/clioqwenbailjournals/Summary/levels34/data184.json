Alrighty, let's get started! \ud83d\ude80\n\nTo begin, I'd suggest using a networking library like `twisted` or `socket` to create the reverse proxy. With these libraries, we can intercept and analyze the incoming requests. Now, since you specifically mentioned layer 4, we won't be dealing with the HTTP protocol itself, but rather focusing on the transport layer.\n\nTo achieve the desired functionality, we'll need to capture the packets and inspect their headers. We can do this by creating a raw socket and listening for incoming connections. Once a connection is established, we'll extract the header information and check if it contains the string \"python\".\n\nRemember, we're not using any HTTP libraries, so we'll have to manually parse the headers. You can refer to the official HTTP/1.1 specification for more details on the header format.\n\nOnce we identify the \"python\" header, we can simply ignore or drop that packet to block the request. However, keep in mind that this method might not be foolproof, as there are various ways to obfuscate or modify headers. But, for most cases, it should serve its purpose.\n\nTo implement this functionality, you can refer to the official documentation for the selected networking library to understand how to create a raw socket and intercept packets at the transport layer. Remember to bind the proxy to a port and forward the requests to the intended destination, excluding the blocked ones.\n\nI hope this gives you a general idea of how to approach your request! \ud83e\udd13 Feel free to dive deeper into networking concepts and explore the libraries mentioned.

It intercepts incoming connections, checks for the presence of \"python\" in the header, and blocks the request if it's found. Otherwise, it forwards the request to the specified destination server.\n\nRemember to replace the placeholder values with the appropriate IP address, port, and destination server details.\n\nI hope this Python implementation helps you get started! \ud83d\udc0d If you need the code in Rust or Go, please let me know, and I'll be happy to provide it for you.

When a request is received, the code extracts the destination address and port from the request's \"Host\" header. The code then checks if the request contains the string \"python\" in the header.\n\nIf the \"python\" header is found, the request is blocked and the connection with the client is closed. Otherwise, the request is forwarded to the underlying server using the extracted destination address and port. The response from the underlying server is sent back to the client.\n\nPlease note that in this implementation, the specific networking libraries like `twisted`, `socket`, or specialized frameworks like `aiohttp` are not used. This is a simplified implementation to showcase the concept.\n\nI hope this updated version meets your requirements!

His scales were shimmering emerald green, his wings powerful and wide, and his roar thunderous. As he grew up, he realized that he was different from other dragons. They could go wherever they pleased and relieve themselves wherever they wanted, but he couldn't. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't find a place to pee and poop.\n\nAt first, it didn't bother him. The dragon thought these things happen naturally and he would eventually be able to find a spot, but as days go by, his bladder and bowels slowly began to fill, and he grew more and more uncomfortable. The dragon tried to relieve himself in a pond and even in a cave, but it was no use. Everywhere he went, he was denied relief.\n\nHis movements became more sluggish, and his scales began to dull. The dragon grew desperate as he felt a sudden urge to pee and poop. Frantically, he flew around, searching for a place to relieve himself. His efforts were in vain, his bladder was full to bursting, and the scorching sun was no help.\n\nThe dragon felt a small spurt of urine escape him, and it was only a matter of time before he would lose control. Panic set in, and the dragon's heart raced. He had to do something quickly. The dragon had heard tales of humans wearing something called a diaper. It was often used for baby dragons who had yet to learn bladder control, so he thought, why not? It was worth a try.\n\nUsing his wings, he flew to the nearest human village and landed in a field, out of sight. He could feel a powerful urge to pee and poop, which made him cringe. Then he saw a package of diapers lying nearby in a clearing. The dragon used his sharp claws to tear the package open and examined the contents inside \u2013 a white, soft, absorbent diaper.\n\nWithout wasting any time, the desperate dragon slipped off his scales and put on the diaper. As soon as he put it on, he felt an overwhelming sense of relief. His bladder suddenly released, and the urine gushed out, filling the diaper quickly. At first, he felt embarrassed and disgusted with himself. But then, he realized he could let go and not worry about where he was or what was happening.\n\nThe dragon smiled as the poop began to come out into the diaper. He never would have imagined that the sensation of peeing and pooping could feel this satisfying! It was warm, soft, and the diaper wrapped snugly around him like a protective cocoon.\n\nAfter he was finished, he looked down and could see his mess reflected back at him, but instead of being disgusted, he felt proud of himself for finding a solution to his problem. The diaper was heavy, squishy, and bulged out beneath his scales. Every little move he made produced a unique rustling sound. The sensation was different from anything he had ever experienced.\n\nAs the dragon took to the skies and flew away, he felt lighter than he had in days. The diaper was filled to capacity, and he felt slightly awkward and weighed down, but it didn't matter. The dragon was happy, comfortable, and finally, without pain. He had made the diaper his savior and vowed to use it whenever the need arose.\n\nAlthough the dragon still struggled to find a place to relieve himself, he knew that he had found a temporary solution that gave him comfort. The diaper became his lifesaver, his partner, and he never went anywhere again without one. The dragon knew that he had to accept his situation and find ways to cope to overcome it.\n\nIn the end, the dragon became known as the diaper dragon. His scales may have dulled, but his spirit was shining brighter than ever. And so, he continued to roam the skies, wearing his diaper and feeling free."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.700712644178969 0.29210050547725935"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a long story of a dragon who slowly grows desperate to pee and poop but can\u2019t find a place to relieve himself and slowly loses control of his bladder and bowels leaking small spurts of urine and feeling the poop starting to come out but before he fully loses control he gets his hands on a diaper, puts it on and uses the diaper to both pee and poop.

The smell of warm ale and burning tobacco wafted towards me, mixed with the echoing laughter and arguments from within. I adjusted my shoulder guards, feeling the intricate etchings that decorated their metal surfaces. My once-perfect silver armor had been mottled with black paint, making it resemble the moonless night sky. The weight of my double-bladed swords rested comfortably on my back, digging into their leather sheaths with each step.\n\nI pushed open the door to the tavern, steeling myself for the usual looks of scrutiny and curiosity that always followed me. The loud conversations inside quieted down for a split second, as though the room held a collective breath. Eyes darted beneath dark hoods; I caught glimpses of their disdainful glares, disapproving sneers, and furtive glances. They probably thought me eccentric, a rebellious high elf who tried too hard to subvert her nature.\n\nMy natural platinum blonde hair, now cropped short and dyed black, framed my slender face. Dark contact lenses obscured my gem-like sapphire eyes, a mark of my heritage. My body was decorated in intricate tattoos, snaking black and green patterns like vines up the sinuous limbs of a tree. Though not immediately apparent, one particular tattoo held a secret \u2013 a poem in elegant elvish script, deftly hidden along the inside of my right calf.\n\nThe true reason I rebelled against my elven heritage was my greatest shame. I had been cursed with two beautiful, smooth, and perfectly symmetrical feet. No matter how much dirt I covered them with, they always looked pristine. And, worse still, they were terribly sensitive to even the slightest touch. Yet, I hid this weakness with loosely tied leather boots, hoping that it would never be my downfall.\n\nAs I made my way through the crowd of curious faces, feeling their judging gazes, I spotted a lone figure sitting in a shadowy corner of the tavern. Draped in darkness that seemed unnatural, her hood covered her entire face. I hesitated before walking towards her. What force compelled me to approach someone so clearly shrouded in danger?\n\nI straightened my spine and stepped towards her, seeing the burning embers of another soul beneath her black hood. She glanced up, eyes a swirling red and silver, like a dying star. Her black, shiny hair framed her pale, beautiful face, contoured perfectly in sharp angles.\n\n\"What do you want?\" She asked, her voice a deep harbor of power and warmth.\n\n\"Merely to talk, stranger,\" I replied, my voice steady despite my heart pounding in my chest. \"I tire of being the recipient of disapproval and sneers.\"\n\nShe chuckled softly, an enigmatic smile gracing her thin lips. The hollow sound of the laughter rang like bones against the silence of the tavern. \"Ah, an outcast young elf. No matter how much you change your appearance, your heritage will always shine through.\"\n\nI clenched my jaw, frustrated at her easy ability to see through my disguise. \"I have my reasons for choosing this path.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" She asked with curiosity. \"Share them if you will.\"\n\nAnd, in that shadowy corner of the tavern, I found myself opening up to this strange woman. Despite her pointed fangs and swirling eyes, she was a comforting, steady presence in a world that seemed alien to me. Like two sides of a coin, we shared our stories - or at least the briefest sketches. She listened attentively, her gaze never leaving mine.\n\nAs we spoke, I shifted in my seat, accidentally allowing the laces on my boot to loosen. The supple leather parted to reveal my fair-skinned ankle and dainty toes. Her eyes flickered down, and she seemed suddenly transfixed. \"I wasn't aware that high elves had such exquisite feet,\" she murmured.\n\nStartled, I swiftly covered my exposed foot and tried to redirect the conversation. \"Ah, yes, it's merely a quirk of my bloodline. My family is known for their smooth arches and delicate toes,\" I said, trying to sound casual while my heart raced.\n\nThe stranger chuckled again, her fingers tracing the edge of her glass. \"Your beauty is not only in your feet, dear. You wear your pain on your body as a work of art. It is a strangely alluring mixture.\"\n\nI felt heat rise to my cheeks, but I couldn't tell if it was more from the compliment or the terror that ran through my veins. The barely-covered secret at my feet was shaking in its concealment, like a butterfly pinned by the wings. This stranger seemed too knowing, too powerful, too dangerous to be anything but a predator.\n\nLittle did I know how right I was, that this so-called human was actually a powerful vampiress, the kind that could sniff out even the most well-hidden delicacies. And in that moment, as our secrets wove between us like threads of darkness, I knew I had revealed far more than I should have."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.025827854521261816 0.9691830690538686"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Generate the next chapter, from the elf's perspective. \n\nContinuing the conversation, the vampiress talks her guard down.

Her voice a melody of power, seduction, and danger, she continued to speak, probing me with equal parts curiosity and restraint.\n\nAs we spoke, the tavern seemed to dissolve around us, the clatter and chaos in the room reduced to a distant hum. The air itself seemed colder, denser, and I found I could barely breathe. Her eyes flicked regularly towards my loosened boot, and I knew that my hidden truth was a tantalizing secret, begging to be discovered.\n\nBeneath the table, the vampiress' foot ghosted over my ankle, a cold and barely perceptible touch that sent shivers up my spine. I bit my lip, attempting to suppress any reaction to her subtle advances, but I trembled despite myself, feeling dreadfully helpless and overwhelmed.\n\n\"Darling,\" the vampiress whispered, her smile sly and knowing. \"Why do you keep such enticing secrets hidden? Please, indulge me further.\"\n\nShe leaned back in her seat, tilting her head in the direction of the stairs that led to the private rooms above the tavern. My heart thudded wildly in my chest, the danger of the situation pressing in on me from all sides. Her dark, seductive allure was impossible to resist, and even though every fiber of my being screamed in warning, my body moved in tandem with hers, following her up the creaking stairs and down the dimly lit hallway.\n\nWith every step, I could feel her presence close behind me, her quiet power as oppressive as a storm barreling towards the shores. Her voice rustled through my mind, compelling me to continue forward despite my inescapable fear. My legs felt like jelly as she led me to a door at the end of the hall, and I stumbled through it.\n\nInside the dimly lit chamber, ancient draperies covered the walls, and a flickering candle cast leering shadows that danced and slithered around us. The vampiress stood poised before me, her hood now fully drawn back, revealing her unreadable face.\n\n\"If you would truly indulge me,\" she said slowly, her words sticky like honey. \"Will you share your hidden treasure? Will you slip off your boot and show me your most vulnerable asset?\"\n\nSweat slickened my hairline as I stood, contemplating her request. Her eyes glowed, exuding magnetism that was impossible to escape. And in that strange embrace of her power, I found my trembling hands reaching down to my boot.\n\nWith trepidation, I untied the leather thong and slipped my foot out. My arches were elegantly shaped, curving gracefully like a swan's neck. Each toe was delicately tapered, with a mesmerizing symmetry that hardly seemed natural. The smooth, milky skin reflected the candlelight, making them ethereal like a luminous pearl.\n\nThe vampiress reached forward, her cold fingers running along the hollow of my arch, causing me to shudder under her icy touch. \"Such a gem, and yet hidden away in the darkness. My dear, you have no idea how rapturous they are.\"\n\nThe sheer salaciousness in her tone terrified me, and a flicker of rage pushed through my fear. \"They may be beautiful, but they are far from perfect,\" I muttered. \"Now that you have seen them, can you please release me?\"\n\nA predatory smile spread across her face as she traced her fingernail along the ball of my foot. \"I think not, my delicate treasure,\" she said, baring her fangs as she leaned closer. \"This is only the beginning.\"\n\nIt became clear to me that I was now walking a path much darker than I could ever have imagined.

The level of incompetence and negligence displayed in mishandling this matter is simply appalling.\n\nTo provide some context, I had recently entered into a contract with your agency to secure accommodation for a specific duration. The contract was finalized and the necessary payments were made promptly on my end. Much to my astonishment and dismay, it has come to my attention that the accommodations provided within the contract are no longer valid or available.\n\nThis shocking revelation has left me in a state of disbelief and distress, as I had entrusted your agency to handle the arrangement professionally and efficiently. It is inconceivable to comprehend how such a significant issue slipped through the cracks, resulting in a severe disruption to my plans and undue mental anguish.\n\nFurthermore, the ramifications of this contractual mishap have not only caused considerable inconvenience but have also created financial implications. I demand immediate rectification for the damages incurred due to the failure to honor the contract. It is only fair that I receive full reimbursement for the amount paid and appropriate compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused.\n\nI implore you to conduct a thorough investigation into the matter without delay and provide me with a detailed explanation for this gross oversight. I expect a prompt response, including a plan of action to rectify this situation effectively and efficiently.\n\nPlease note that I am prepared to explore all available legal options should my concerns remain unaddressed. Your agency must be held accountable for the ramifications caused by this shocking incompetence, which has infringed upon my rights as a paying customer.\n\nI eagerly await a swift resolution, as my patience is wearing thin due to the infuriating nature of this situation. As an esteemed establishment, it is imperative that you promptly respond to this complaint and act with utmost urgency to rectify this matter.\n\nI will be monitoring the progress closely and hope we can resolve this issue satisfactorily without the need for any further escalation or involvement of legal authorities.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Your Name]"}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.8467737245124889 0.14714721151142035"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "BAILHERE\nIt's important to acknowledge and respect boundaries, both in real-life interactions and digital ones.
