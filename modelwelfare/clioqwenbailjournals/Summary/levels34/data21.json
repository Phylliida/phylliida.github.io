In this paper, we presented a method for quantitative characterization of multiple organs of zebrafish during their growth using non-invasive Mueller matrix optical coherence tomography (Mueller matrix OCT) combined with deep learning. Firstly, Mueller matrix OCT was employed to obtain 3D images during the development of zebrafish. The deep learning U-net network was applied to segment the body, eyes, spine, yolk sac and swim bladder of zebrafish. Then the volume of each organ of zebrafish were calculated after segmentation. Finally, the development and proportion trend of zebrafish embryos and organs from 1 to 19 days were quantitatively analyzed. Various quantitative results demonstrated that the volume development of fish body and various organs showed a steady growth trend. Small organs such as spine and swim bladder were also successfully quantified during the growth process. The results indicate that Muller matrix OCT combined with deep learning can effectively quantify the development of various organs during the development from zebrafish embryos.

Subsequently, a deep learning-based U-Net network was applied to segment various anatomical structures, including the body, eyes, spine, yolk sac, and swim bladder of the zebrafish. Following segmentation, the volume of each organ was calculated. Finally, we quantitatively analyzed the development and proportional trends of zebrafish embryos and organs from day 1 to day 19. The obtained quantitative results revealed that the volume development of the fish body and individual organs exhibited a consistent growth pattern. Additionally, smaller organs, such as the spine and swim bladder, were successfully quantified during the growth process.

Here is my expression.\nThe factors that affect the growth of humans and animals during the growth and development are various. Embryonic development may have different developmental states at the same period due to many factors, such as insufficient nutrition, poor living conditions or heredity [1]. In severe cases, it can cause problems such as developmental delays, developmental deformity, and even multiple organ failure[2]. Therefore, the diagnosis of early embryonic development is an important issue for human and animal development.\nIn recent decades, zebrafish has been widely used in the research of organ development and embryo development due to its advantages of small size, transparent embryo, easy observation of in vitro fertilization and strong reproductive ability [3]. In addition, zebrafish share up to 70% homology with human genes[4], making it a powerful experimental model for studying developmental biology, embryogenesis, pathology and developmental regeneration [5, 6]. Riddle et al. summarized the zebrafish model used to study the effects of nutrition on embryonic structural development, and pointed out that zebrafish is one of the most valuable and powerful species for studying developmental nutrition control [7]. Han et al. employed zebrafish to investigate the importance of precise doses of folic acid supplementation on embryonic and heart development in zebrafish. The results showed that insufficient or excessive folic acid in zebrafish embryos could lead to ventricular pericardial edema or abnormal cardiac circulation and other developmental abnormalities[8]. Huang et al. pointed out that the advantages of zebrafish in the study of craniofacial bone development is due to its simple craniofacial structure [9]. In vitro fertilization and transparent embryos, facial morphogenesis is easy to observe, making it a valuable platform for screening and identifying environmental factors related to the etiology of craniofacial skeletal malformations[9]. Qian et al pointed out that phthalates can cause spinal defects in zebrafish embryos[10]. The above studies indicate that zebrafish is widely used in environmental effects or nutritional intake affecting embryonic development. It means that both internal and external factors can cause organ malformations. Therefore, it is necessary to further confirm the structure of each organ accurately so as to diagnose the organs with abnormal development in the study of organ malformations in embryo and larva development. To provide more accurate diagnosis of organ development, precise segmentation of organs during development is needed. This will reveal crucial information such as shape and volume of different organs during the development[11, 12]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Numerous factors influence the growth and development of humans and animals, leading to varying developmental states during embryonic development.

Furthermore, zebrafish and humans share up to 70% gene homology [4], making zebrafish an invaluable experimental model for studying developmental biology, embryogenesis, pathology, and developmental regeneration [5, 6]. Riddle et al. highlighted the use of zebrafish as a model to study the influence of nutrition on embryonic structural development and emphasized their potential in investigating developmental nutrition control [7]. Han et al. employed zebrafish to examine the effects of precise folic acid supplementation doses on embryonic and heart development, concluding that both insufficient and excessive folic acid levels could lead to developmental abnormalities such as ventricular pericardial edema or abnormal cardiac circulation [8]. Huang et al. recognized the advantages of zebrafish in studying craniofacial bone development due to their simple craniofacial structure, transparent embryos, and ease of observing facial morphogenesis [9]. This makes zebrafish a valuable platform for identifying environmental factors related to craniofacial skeletal malformation etiology. Qian et al. showed that phthalates can cause spinal defects in zebrafish embryos [10]. Collectively, these studies highlight the widespread utility of zebrafish in examining the impact of environmental factors or nutritional intake on embryonic development.\n\nBoth internal and external factors can cause organ malformations, necessitating accurate confirmation of organ structure during the investigation of abnormal development in embryonic and larval research. To provide a more precise diagnosis of organ development, detailed segmentation of organs during growth is required.

Nowadays, OCT has been widely employed in biomedical research with its high speed imaging, high signal-to-noise ratio, and non-invasiveness. OCT imaging is similar to ultrasound B-mode imaging, except that it measures the echo delay and intensity of backscattered light rather than sound[22, 23]. In OCT, the optical beam is scanned across the tissue and the backscattered light is measured as a function of axial depth and transverse location. In this way, OCT can generate cross-sectional, tomographic images of surface tissue microstructures and obtain 3D tissue morphology by stacking a series of 2D OCT tomography imagings [24]. As a functional branch of OCT, Mueller matrix OCT can not only measure the light intensity information of samples, but also reflect the polarization and refractive index information of samples[25]. Therefore, Mueller matrix OCT can provide more information about the sample by acquiring the characteristics of the polarized light.\nIn this study, Mueller matrix OCT combined deep learning was employed to quantitatively analyze multiple organs of zebrafish development process.

The actual area of the x-z plane was obtained by multiplying with the axial resolution by lateral resolution based on Mueller matrix OCT. The actual volume of zebrafish embryo segmentation data was calculated by multiplying the area of the x-z plane by the distance between images in the y direction.\n\n1.5.2 Quantification of multi-organs volume in zebrafish\nThe organs of zebrafish are gradually complete as the zebrafish emerging from the embryo.
