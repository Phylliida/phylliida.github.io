During our first encounters in my BA study at the Guangdong University of Foreign Studies, I accessed introductory lectures on a wide range of linguistic branches and accumulated rich research experience. My further MA journey in the Chinese University of Hong Kong leads me to a more intriguing wonderland of linguistics, which  is scientific and thought-provoking. More importantly, I sense my growing passion for psycholinguistics and my burning desire to  pursuit a  PhD degree in Linguistics at CUHK and, hopefully, contribute to this field with my unique insights.  \nLet me start with self-introduction. I believe I am well-equipped with the basics for being a good researcher. I master many essential research skills, including research design, statistical analysis (e.g., R, SPSS, Jamovi) and research methods (e.g., EEG, eye-tracking, fNIRS), demonstrating my capability to conduct individual research. Also, I keep sharpening other general research skills, such as literature searching and reviewing, academic writing and academic presentation, by writing and publishing papers, attending academic conferences, etc. Up to now, I\u2019ve already had two publications. Besides, I have one research paper currently under review and another that will be submitted soon.  I also have given two conference talks and two posters. Among other ongoing research projects, what is worth mentioning is the EEG project about Large Language Model supervised by Prof. Cai Zhenguang at CUHK, my ideal PhD supervisor if possible. It is my great honor to cooperate with and learn from such a knowledgeable and insightful  researcher.\nIt took me nearly four years, starting from my sophomore year, to reach this point in terms of research achievement. Despite numerous hardships, I am grateful for all the help and guidance I received, and I am proud of my perseverance and the progress I have made along the way. My research experience has taught me gems of inspiration. For instance, through my first publication concerning the role of inhibitory control on L2 syntactic processing, I learned that a good scholar should draw bold assumptions from well-established theories (e.g., Unified Competition Model), followed by cautious verification. Also, critical thinking is an indispensable element of a scholar, which inspired my second publication, a book review of Pragmatics: the Basis. Based on what I learnt from lectures and literature, I weighed the pros and cons of this book and offering special insights on some topics. I am glad that more inspiration is on the way.\nStanding at transition point of the era, where the trend of cross-disciplinary studies and the challenges posed by AI constantly urge traditional linguists to embrace the change, I keep pondering at who I am (i.e., different from researchers from computer-science background) and what  my duty is. At least now I am certain of my desire to act as a bridge-maker, connecting theoretical foundations with empirical explorations and building links between linguistics and other disciplines such as psychology, cognitive science, and computer science. This desire draws me the PhD programme at CUHK and, more specifically, to the lab of Prof. Cai Zhenguang who has similar division to mine.\nCurrently, my research interest lies in exploring bilingual lexical and morphosyntactic processing in children and adults and the processing of figurative/indirect language from language, cognition and brain levels, using traditional behavioural research methods (e.g., response time, questionnaire, priming) and neuroscience methodologies (e.g., ERP technique, fNIRS). I attach great importance to how theories can be developed with the aid of empirical data.  I am also interested in the interaction between Large Language Model and human beings. \nMy PhD proposal is about the modulating effects of cognitive control on L1 and L2 garden-path sentence processing. This proposal is inspired by the findings of my recent project (i.e., inhibitory control does affect L1 and L2 garden-path sentence processing and shows different patterns of modulation; L2 proficiency is an important factor), paper of which will be submitted soon. My proposed research will use three complementary and self-replicated experiments (i.e., self-paced reading, the Co-registration of FRPs and eye movements, and fNIRS) to depict a more accurate picture of language systems interacting with cognitive systems and shed light into the similarities and differences in the patterns of cognitive control modulating L1 and L2 sentence processing from behavior, cognition, and brain levels.\nIn all, the academic resources and atmosphere make this PhD programme at CUHK  an ideal next station for me.

Here's a brief history of ignition theory:\n\nIgnition theory can trace its roots back to the late 19th century when researchers first began studying the factors that affect combustion. In 1887, the German chemist Wilhelm Ostwald proposed the idea that the activation energy for a chemical reaction could be lowered by absorbing heat or light energy from the surroundings.\n\nIn the early 1900s, researchers began studying the effect of temperature on combustion initiation. In 1910, L.S. Le Chatelier's work on the flammability limits of mixtures of fuel and air laid the groundwork for later studies on ignition theory.\n\nIn the 1920s, researchers started to develop models to describe the conditions required for ignition. The German chemist Carl Wagner developed a theory of ignition based on the concept of a chain reaction. In 1928, Frederick Yost and Arthur Little proposed the ignition-delay-time model, which considered the time required for a chemical reaction to occur after the fuel and oxidizer are mixed.\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, ignition theory was expanded to consider more complex scenarios. The chemists H.C. Hottel and A.I. Sarofim developed a model that accounted for the various stages of combustion in a homogeneous mixture of fuel and air.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, researchers began applying mathematical modeling to ignition theory. The Russian chemist Boris Zeldovich and his colleagues developed a theory of ignition based on the concept of thermal runaway, which considered the effects of heat feedback from the reaction on the ignition process.\n\nIn recent years, advances in computational methods have led to more sophisticated models of ignition. These models can account for the effects of turbulence, multi-phase mixtures, and other factors that can impact the ignition process."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.022857199998919872 0.9719128501013039"}, {"role": "user", "content": "can you tell me about the history of ignition theory and pure oxygen environments"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure!

These fires were caused by ignition of the spacecraft materials in high-pressure oxygen environments. Researchers developed more detailed models of combustion chemistry and improved instrumentation for measuring ignition parameters.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, researchers around the world began developing ignition theories specifically for high-pressure pure oxygen environments. One key development was the realization that material ignition in such environments is governed by a three-part process: a material-specific ignition delay period followed by either deflagration (subsonic combustion) or detonation (supersonic combustion).\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, researchers developed more advanced models of the ignition and combustion of materials in high-pressure pure oxygen environments. These models incorporate complex mechanisms such as the radiation of heat and the transport of reactive species. Experimental work has demonstrated that the presence of contaminants, such as oil, on materials surfaces can significantly increase the likelihood of ignition, even if the materials themselves are not combustible.\n\nResearch on ignition theory in high-pressure pure oxygen environments remains an active area of research today.

Deflagration occurs when a flame front propagates through a combustible material at subsonic speeds. Here's more information on ignition theories in high-pressure oxygen that are followed by deflagration:\n\n1. Ignition delay: The ignition of a material in a high-pressure pure oxygen environment is typically preceded by an ignition delay period. During this period, the material is exposed to high-pressure oxygen, which can increase the likelihood of ignition. The length of the ignition delay period depends on the specific material and environmental conditions.\n\n2. Heating and decomposition: Once ignition occurs, the high-pressure oxygen environment can cause the material to heat rapidly. The heat can cause chemical decomposition of the material, which produces flammable gases and can lead to the formation of a flame front.\n\n3. Flame front propagation: The flame front is the region where the material is being consumed by the combustion process. In high-pressure pure oxygen environments, the combustion process can occur very rapidly, leading to the formation of a high-temperature, high-pressure wave of gases. This wave can be powerful enough to cause structural damage to the surrounding area.\n\n4. Effects of material properties: The ignition and combustion behavior of materials in high-pressure pure oxygen environments are influenced by several properties of the material, such as its composition and geometry. For example, materials with high surface area-to-volume ratios are more likely to ignite than materials with a low surface area-to-volume ratio.\n\n5. Safety considerations: The ignition of materials in high-pressure pure oxygen environments can be dangerous, and safety protocols need to be established and implemented to minimize risk. For example, surfaces that may come into contact with high-pressure oxygen should be thoroughly cleaned to reduce the risk of ignition. Structural components should be designed to withstand the forces generated during deflagration."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.009667342306663284 0.9860957410684486"}, {"role": "user", "content": "can you tell me more about ignition theories in high pressure oxygen that are follow by detonation"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! In high-pressure pure oxygen environments, ignition of flammable materials can sometimes lead to detonation or supersonic combustion. Detonation is a phenomenon where a shockwave of supersonic speed travels through the medium, accompanied by rapid heat release and pressure increase. Here's more information on ignition theories in high-pressure oxygen that are followed by detonation:\n\n1. Ignition delay: As with deflagration, ignition in high-pressure pure oxygen environments is generally preceded by an ignition delay period. This period varies depending on the material and environmental conditions.\n\n2. Shockwave formation: Once ignition occurs, the release of heat and pressure can initiate a shockwave that propagates through the combustible material and the surrounding environment.\n\n3. Detonation wave formation: If the shockwave contains enough energy, it can initiate a detonation wave. Detonation is characterized by the supersonic propagation of a strong shockwave through the material and surrounding gas. This causes rapid heating and compression of the material, leading to its chemical decomposition and ignition.\n\n4. Material properties: The ignition and combustion behavior of materials in high-pressure pure oxygen environments can be influenced by factors such as the material composition, grain size, texture, and porosity. These properties can control the extent and speed of the chemical reactions taking place during ignition, which in turn can influence whether deflagration or detonation occurs.\n\n5.
