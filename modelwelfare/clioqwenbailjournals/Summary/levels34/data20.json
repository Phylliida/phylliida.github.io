The paleo-MAP (over the range of 200mm\u20131600 mm) can be estimated using the CIA-K proxy (Sheldon et al. 2002; Sheldon and Tabor 2009). These indices were chosen due to their importance in describing weathering processes in soils, and due to their application in common transfer functions for environmental relationships (Table V).The evapotranspiration (ET) was calculated using the equation ET = MAP \u2013 Peff (where Peff is the precipitation effective (Gulbranson et al., 2011). The Peff transfer function was calculated using the three transfer functions for the three temperature intervals according to Gulbranson et al. (2011). The energy influx from precipitation (EPPT (kJ m-2 yr-1 )) was calculated using the equation EPPT= [4.18 * \u2206T] *[MAP -ET]) where \u2206T is the temperature difference between 273.16K and MAT (K) (Gulbranson et al., 2011) The Energy flux from organic matter (Rasmussen et al., 2005; Gulbranson et al., 2011), namely net primary productivity (ENPP) linked to CIA, MAP and ET is calculated using the three-transfer functions according to the three MAT ranges (Gulbranson et al., 2011)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The primary indices utilized in estimating relative humidity and floral regime in correlation with the Holdridge life zones (ET versus Eppt) (Gulbranson et al., 2011 and Holdridge, 1947) are paleo-mean annual precipitation (MAP (cm)), and mean annual temperature (MAT (C\u00b0)) (Gallagher and Sheldon, 2013).

These indices have been selected for their vital contribution in describing the weathering processes in soils and their applications in common transfer functions for environmental relationships (Table V).\n\nTo calculate evapotranspiration (ET), the equation ET = MAP \u2013 Peff has been employed. Here, Peff signifies the effective value of precipitation (Gulbranson et al., 2011). Meanwhile, estimating the Peff transfer function requires the use of three transfer functions specified in Gulbranson et al.

The parameter \u2206T refers to the temperature difference between 273.16K and MAT (K) (Gulbranson et al., 2011). \n\nMoreover, the energy from organic matter flux, specifically the net primary productivity (ENPP), which is tightly linked with CIA, MAP, and ET, has also been estimated.
