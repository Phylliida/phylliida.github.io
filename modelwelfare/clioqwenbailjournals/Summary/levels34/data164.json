By making accurate information and resources readily available to students, Black hopes that they can make informed decisions and avoid acting disrespectfully. More Importantly, Black highlights the importance of bystander intervention training. He urges students to take active measures in both speaking out and intervening if a situation develops. By building a culture of accountability and mutual support, Black hopes this will ensure that everyone is living in an environment that is safer and more respectful.\nBlack further suggests that companies can introduce clear policies and protocols on how to handle incidents of harassment or misconduct. That means setting up confidential reporting lines and ensuring that all incidents reported are taken seriously and tracked down quickly. Black hopes that by applying a degree of accountability to individuals for their behavior he can also deter future incidences of ill-treatment and promote a culture based on respect and consent.\nadditionally, Black adds that it is important to encourage positive masculinity and to contest negative stereotypes. He encourages boys to see masculinity in terms of empathy, understanding and kindness rather than just strength or aggression - he wants them to chart a more inclusive yet equal practi ce between men. Black hopes that by doing this he can dissolve negative attitudes that make it easy for people to mistreat others and that contribute in an indirect way to the greater mistreatment of society.\nStill, he encourages the redefinition of masculinity away from brute strength and sometimes brute action.

This position is premised on the fact that the manufacturing industry may face an extinction as a result of organisational inefficiency as facilitated by poor employees\u2019 job performance. (Onyeizugbe et al., 2019), every manufacturing company wants to break even with their products in the market place, wanting it to be consumed by all. However, producing quality products and making sure that these products are always available in the market at all time and that production is not stopped or hampered by any reason (Suzaki, 1987). (Fatile et al., 2020), argued that organisations are obliged to establish and keep long-term relationships with their staff members, this includes recognizing employees' intentions to leave, and using preventive methods that forecast factors or causes, to limit them before they occur. \n\tConsequently, the various forms of behaviour and attitude disposition which organisations require of its employees in order to achieve set goals depends on talent   management aspect of human resources  practices obtainable in the organisation (Nishii, Lepak & Schneider, 2008). This implies that survival of an organisation rested on employee talent management.  Interestingly, the concept of talent management has gained more ground and relevant due to evolution of corporate human resource management in today\u2019s present work environment. Talent management remains one of the most future-oriented practices in both private and public businesses (Ganaie & Haque, 2017).  (Fatile et al., 2020), positioned that as talent remains scarce among other factors of production, there is a need to effectively manage and retain available ones in the interest of the organisation. Today, organisations now understand and appreciate the need to have the best talents, if they must survive in this hypercompetitive and increasingly complex business environment (Smith, 2020).  It also illustrates the need to fill up key positions promptly with employees whose talents were developed within the organisation (Cappelli, 2000). \n This aims at ensuring the right job placements at the right time, in the right position for the right candidates to deliver their best and remain committed to the organisation. Though, talent management is organisation-specific, but the focus is on developing and optimizing high potentials or talents of individuals within the organisation more quickly than ever, to enhance competitiveness. Talent is one of the critical resources for organisations to attain competitive advantage and talent management will fail without top management commitment to retaining its workforce (Okeke & Dunkwu., 2019). Effective talent management endears talented employees to an organisation as employees begin to see themselves as part of the organisation, add value to the organisation and remain glued to it (Faruna, 2018). The author further stressed that the  essence is  to  ensure employees remain professional at all times in their business practices, serve meritoriously, have the right people made up of seasoned professionals, who have excelled in their various professions, possessing the requisite integrity, skills and experience. \n      Essentially, talent management signifies comprehensive and integrated human resource practices with the goal of attracting and retaining the right individuals, for the right positions, at the right time (Sajeda, 2017). Thus Integrated talent management strategies are the combinations of series of human resources management practices of maintaining and retaining employee for a better job performance. These strategies according to Hazem (2018) include, recruiting, retaining and developing the most talented and superior employees."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Similarly, the issue of employee performance is a significant challenge affecting the manufacturing sector, just as it impacts other organizational environments. This concern is rooted in the belief that the manufacturing sector could potentially decline due to organizational inefficiency driven by subpar performance of its workers. Onyeizugbe and colleagues (2019) highlight that manufacturing firms aim to achieve market zenith with their offerings, desiring widespread consumer acceptance. However, the emphasis is on delivering high-quality products, ensuring their constant market availability, and preventing any obstacles to continuous production (Suzaki, 1987). Fatile and others (2020) contend that it is imperative for organizations to cultivate and maintain enduring relationships with their employees. This involves identifying potential intentions among employees to leave and implementing strategies that predict and mitigate these motivations before they materialize.\n\nThe expected behaviors and attitudes from employees that organizations rely on to meet their objectives are closely linked to how well they manage talent, as reflected in their human resources practices (Nishii, Lepak & Schneider, 2008). This suggests that organizational longevity hinges on effective talent management. Interestingly, the significance of talent management has become more pronounced with the evolution of corporate human resource management in the current professional landscape. It is now recognized as one of the forward-thinking practices in both the public and private sectors (Ganaie & Haque, 2017). Fatile and colleagues (2020) emphasize that since talent is a rare commodity among production factors, its proper management and retention is crucial for organizational success. In today's intensely competitive and complex business realm, companies increasingly acknowledge the necessity of securing top talent to remain viable (Smith, 2020). This entails promptly filling pivotal roles with internally developed talent (Cappelli, 2000).\n\nThe objective is to ensure optimal job placements promptly and accurately, positioning the right individuals to perform excellently and stay loyal to the organization. While talent management strategies can vary by organization, the overarching aim is to identify and cultivate the potentials of individuals more rapidly than before, boosting competitive edge. Talent represents a pivotal asset for organizations seeking a competitive advantage, and without the staunch support from top management for workforce retention, talent management initiatives may falter (Okeke & Dunkwu, 2019). Successful talent management makes employees feel integral to the organization, encouraging them to contribute value and remain dedicated (Faruna, 2018). The author also underscored the importance of ensuring that employees consistently adhere to professional standards in their practices, bringing together a team of distinguished professionals marked by exceptional integrity, skills, and experience.\n\nIn essence, talent management encompasses a holistic and integrated approach to human resources aimed at drawing in and keeping the right people in suitable roles at the appropriate times (Sajeda, 2017). Therefore, integrated talent management strategies combine various human resource management practices focused on sustaining and improving employee performance. According to Hazem (2018), these strategies involve recruiting, retaining, and fostering the development of top-tier and talented staff."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.0027917734406999713 0.9939403418549001"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The strategy also refers to the critical corporate function where the company strives to have the best talent, closing all the talent gaps and managing the talent by insuring that the right person is in the right job at the right time to achieve the best possible results (Hezekiah, Opeyemi & Oluwatunmise, 2022). Keeping in view  various strategies and  indices of  talent management as put forward by  different researchers, this study consider it necessary to select  integrated  talent management strategies  relevant to address the  ravaging issues of employees\u2019 turnover intentions and poor job performance, the strategies  are: human resource planning, recruitment and selection, employee development, employee retention,  employee health and safety management, and employee  performance appraisal.\nHuman resource planning is one of the major strategies of understanding the talent requirements. Employee planning is the foundation of staffing; hence, the process that identifies current and future human resources needs for an organisation to achieve its goals (Armstrong, 2006). Wheeler (2014) says that employee planning is the first step in the talent management process and entails understanding the talent requirements and aligning them with the organisational goals as well as the specific service delivery environment in which the public sector department functions. According to Akinremi and Adedeji (2019), successful organisations forecast the supply and demand of their skills according to their skills requirements and ensure that top performing employees are retained in the organisation.\nAnother important strategy of integrated talent management is, employee development, i.e. provision of training and development in public and private organisations (career development, on /off the Job training, seminar, workshop, orientation and mentoring).  Kim (2014) emphasized how organisations should develop its technical talent professionals who must be trained or certified to perform their roles successfully. It is also a set of systematic and planned activities designed by an organisation to provide its members with the opportunities to learn necessary skills to meet current and future demands of work (Ogbeta, Nzewi & Chiekezie, 2015). Participation in staff development programmes by an employee is to begin immediately as a person is employed and should continue throughout a person\u2019s career (Werner & Desimone, 2011). They further opined that objective of employee resources development in organisation like manufacturing industries is to increase the skills and knowledge of the workers. Employee development no doubt adds value to organisations in terms of increased productivity, morale and greater organisational efficiency (Rashid & Ayoode, 2020). \n Employee retention is also a very crucial integrated talent management strategy. This strategy can simply be put as the policies and plans organisations have in place and follow to satisfy the diverse needs of employees and create an environment those employees to stay in the organisation (David, 2008). Financial and non-financial rewards policies, such remuneration, compensation, recognition, promotion and fringe, benefit, supervisors\u2019 supports, etc. are commonly retention strategies for controlling employees\u2019 turnover intentions and job performance. Employee retention can be represented by a simple statistic (for example, a retention rate of 80% usually indicates that an organisation kept 80% of its employees in a given period) (Smith, 2020)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This approach also signifies a crucial business operation where the enterprise aspires to secure optimal talent, bridging any talent deficiencies and effectively managing talent to ensure the placement of the correct individual in the suitable role at the opportune moment for the highest achievable outcomes (Hezekiah, Opeyemi & Oluwatunmise, 2022). Taking into account various methodologies and measures of talent management proposed by different scholars, this investigation deems it vital to adopt comprehensive talent management techniques aimed at confronting the pressing challenges related to employees' inclinations towards leaving and substandard job performance. The identified strategies include: strategic human resource planning, recruitment and selection, development of employees, retention strategies, management of employee health and safety, and appraisal of employee performance.\n\nStrategic human resource planning stands as a pivotal strategy in discerning talent requisites. It lays the groundwork for staffing by identifying present and forthcoming human resource requirements that an organization must meet to reach its objectives (Armstrong, 2006). Wheeler (2014) mentions that employee planning is the initial phase in talent management, involving the understanding of talent needs and their alignment with organizational objectives and the specific operational context of the public sector entity. Akinremi and Adedeji (2019) note that successful entities project the supply and demand for their talent based on skill needs, ensuring the retention of high-performing employees within the organization.\n\nA key facet of comprehensive talent management includes employee development, encompassing training and advancement opportunities in both public and private sectors (such as career advancement, on-the-job and off-the-job training, seminars, workshops, induction, and mentorship). Kim (2014) highlighted the importance of nurturing an organization's technical talent, who must receive adequate training or certification to excel in their roles. It also involves a sequence of organized and deliberate actions crafted by an organization to offer its members the chance to acquire the skills required for current and future job demands (Ogbeta, Nzewi & Chiekezie, 2015). The engagement of an employee in development programs should commence upon employment and persist throughout their career (Werner & Desimone, 2011). They also argued that the goal of resource advancement in organizations, such as manufacturing firms, is to enhance workers' skills and knowledge, undeniably contributing value to organizations in terms of productivity, morale, and overall efficiency (Rashid & Ayoode, 2020).\n\nEmployee retention is an equally vital strategy within integrated talent management. This strategy encompasses the approaches and initiatives that organizations implement and adhere to in order to meet the varied needs of employees and foster an environment that encourages them to remain with the organization (David, 2008). The utilization of both financial and non-financial rewards, such as salary, incentives, acknowledgment, promotion and additional benefits, support from supervisors, among others, are typical retention methods aimed at curbing employees' tendencies to leave and enhancing job performance. The concept of employee retention can be illustrated through a basic metric (for instance, maintaining 80% of its workforce within a specific timeframe is indicative of an organization's retention success) (Smith, 2020)."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.0035798961279474607 0.9926061644876752"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The author explained further that,  the rate of retention is the inverse of the rate of employee turnover and expectedly if a relatively high number of employees stayed at post within a specified period then the retention rate is high and the turnover rate is low i.e. (Retention rate = 1/turnover rate). Retaining employees is an important goal of every organisation. It helps to reduce wastage in terms of the time, effort and money spent in hiring and training new employees and integrating them into the organisation (Griffeth & Hom, 2001). Retaining all the employees may not be the desire of every business. Most of the organisations are concerned with retaining the high performers, those who possess key skill and knowledge needed to run the organisation and those who are difficult to be replaced (Ogbeta, et. at, 2015). \nMore so, employee health and safety management as part of integrated talent management strategies depict general state of physical, mental, and emotional well-being of an employee (Amponsah-Tawiah & Dartey-Baah, 2011). Organisation like manufacturing industry is expected to comply with the Nigerian labour acts embedded under occupational safety and health (Ngwama, 2016). This is to ensure that, the industry takes into consideration health and safety precaution measures against organisational work hazard (Ngwama, 2016). This is important because, healthy worker is the one who is free from illness, injury, mental and emotional problems that may impair his normal work activity or routine (Dwomoh, Owusu& Addo, 2013). Onoh- Linus (2021) put it more succinctly that an organisation where employees within feel that management \u2018cares\u2019 for them, there is an indication of positive management of occupational health and safety system and as such results in safer working practices and also have positive impact on employee job performance. Positive or greater records of these outcomes support the ability of the employee to perform very well on the job for the organisation to achieve its goals (Adedayo, 2017). Thus, employee health and safety should inform policy statement covering circumstance leading to employee turnover and unconditional service withdrawal occasioned by injury, sickness and death (Beth, 2018).\nStill on talent management strategy, employee performance appraisal is a strategy worth of note in this study.  According Onwuka, Ugwu and Kekeocha (2020), the key rationale to undertake performance appraisal is to gather essential information about employees for decision making. The authors further stressed that it determines employee performance, assists to communicate any areas of improvement to employees and helps the management to come up with a plan of ensuring good relations between supervisors and employees for enhanced organisational performance. This encourages employees to understand how their performance is contributing to the public sector department, they are committed to stay in the organisation (Linah, 2018). In his own views, Bello (2019) submitted that globally, diverse performance evaluation practices are employed depending on business, human resources cadre and corporation cultures. Performance appraisal has been integrated by organisations in diverse sectors in an attempt to strive and continue to exist in a global competitive economy (Onwuka et. al., 2020). Therefore, in any organisation, human capital is the most important asset that can be relied on to attain competitive advantage."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The writer goes on to state that the retention rate is directly opposed to the employee turnover rate, meaning that if a considerable number of employees remain within the company over a specific timeframe, then the retention rate is deemed high, conversely making the turnover rate low; put simply, (Retention rate = 1 / turnover rate). Keeping employees within the company is a critical aim for every business as it helps minimize losses related to the expenditure of time, effort, and finances involved in the recruitment and training of new staff, and their subsequent assimilation into the corporate environment (Griffeth & Hom, 2001). However, not all businesses aspire to retain every employee. Many are primarily focused on keeping high-performing individuals, those with essential skills and knowledge crucial for the company's operation, and those challenging to replace (Ogbeta, et al., 2015).\n\nAdditionally, the management of employee health and safety, as an element of comprehensive talent management strategies, reflects the overall physical, mental, and emotional wellness of workers (Amponsah-Tawiah & Dartey-Baah, 2011). Industries, such as manufacturing, are expected to adhere to the regulations outlined in the Nigerian labour laws concerning occupational safety and health practices (Ngwama, 2016). This adherence aims to ensure industries consider preventative measures against workplace hazards (Ngwama, 2016). This aspect is vital because a healthy employee is one who is devoid of any illness, injury, and psychological issues that could hinder their normal work routines or activities (Dwomoh, Owusu & Addo, 2013). Onoh-Linus (2021) clarified that in an organization where employees feel valued and cared for by management, there tends to be a positive implementation of occupational health and safety systems, leading to safer work practices and a positive impact on job performance. A higher frequency of these positive outcomes enhances the employee's ability to perform effectively, helping the organization to reach its objectives (Adedayo, 2017). Consequently, employee health and safety considerations should guide policies addressing factors that lead to employee turnover, including involuntary departures due to injury, illness, and mortality (Beth, 2018).\n\nRegarding talent management strategy, the employee performance appraisal is another key strategy highlighted in this discourse. According to Onwuka, Ugwu, and Kekeocha (2020), the primary purpose of conducting performance appraisals is to collect imperative data concerning employees for decision-making processes. The authors emphasize that such assessments determine employee performance levels, facilitate communication on areas requiring improvement, and aid management in fostering positive relationships between supervisors and their subordinates for improved organizational performance. This process motivates employees by showing them how their contributions propel the public sector department forward, encouraging their continued association with the organization (Linah, 2018). Bello (2019) points out that across the globe, performance evaluation practices vary in accordance with business needs, human resource structures, and organizational cultures. Performance appraisals have been adopted by companies across various sectors in an effort to thrive and sustain in the globally competitive market (Onwuka et al., 2020). Thus, in any business entity, human capital stands as the most significant asset for securing a competitive edge."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.005887855869047814 0.9901852701730786"}, {"role": "user", "content": "However, the extent of the influence of selected different strategies of talent management on employee turnover intention and job performance still remains cloudy (Holden &Vaiman, 2013).

Despite being a vital sector for economic growth and development, the industry is experiencing high turnover rates and suboptimal employee performance (Bikefe & Daniel, 2022). This raises concerns about the long-term sustainability and competitiveness of manufacturing companies in the region. The manufacturing industry in Southwest Nigeria is grappling with high employee turnover rates, resulting in significant costs for companies and hindering their ability to maintain a skilled and experienced workforce (Bikefe & Daniel, 2022). Furthermore, the manufacturing in southwest Nigeria is facing the challenges in maintaining high levels of employee performance.\nTalent management strategies in manufacturing companies are poor and rife with unethical behaviours, such as selection bias, management preferences, Federal character syndrome, influences of ethnicity and social class, selection discrimination, favouritism, and godfather syndrome (Fajana, 2009). For instance, despite the importance of effective human resource planning in supporting talent management strategies, there are gaps, challenges, and shortcomings within the manufacturing industry in South West Nigeria. Okonkwo et al. (2022) claim that many firms, particularly those in the private sector, have given human resource planning\u2014a crucial management function\u2014less priority. Even the so-called large companies in the private sector lack well-articulated HR planning, which has serious financial repercussions for the organizations in the areas of excessive hiring, poor job performance, training, and transfers. \nFurthermore, the recruitment and selection processes employed by manufacturing companies in South West Nigeria exhibit key issues, gaps, shortcomings, and challenges. According to Ekwoaba et al. (2015), most recruitment and selection processes have elements of subjective judgement inherent in them. Furthermore, Adagbabiri et al. (2020) pointed out that inconsistent and poorly organized hiring processes in Nigeria organisations have resulted in biased decisions, selecting applicants who are not the greatest fits for the position. These negatively impact the implementation of integrated talent management strategies, leading to higher employee turnover intention and poor job performance.

The manufacturing sector in Southwest Nigeria is confronting significant challenges related to keeping employees and optimizing their performance. Even though this sector is crucial for economic growth and development, it suffers from high staff turnover and less-than-ideal performance levels among its employees (Bikefe & Daniel, 2022). These issues raise concerns about the sector's ability to sustain its operations and remain competitive in the long term. The high turnover has particularly impacted the industry's capacity to sustain a competent and experienced workforce, thus affecting the performance levels (Bikefe & Daniel, 2022).\n\nThe talent management practices within manufacturing companies are plagued with issues like unethical behaviors, including biases in selection, management preferences, the Federal character syndrome, the influence of ethnicity and social class, discriminatory practices, favoritism, and the prevalence of the godfather syndrome (Fajana, 2009). For example, critical aspects such as human resource planning, which supports talent management strategies, face numerous deficiencies, challenges, and shortcomings within the manufacturing industry in Southwest Nigeria. Okonkwo et al. (2022) observed that many companies, particularly in the private sector, have not prioritized human resource planning, a vital management function. This neglect, even amongst larger private sector companies, has led to significant financial consequences in terms of unnecessary hiring, subpar job performance, and inadequate training and transfers.\n\nMoreover, the recruitment and selection methods utilized by manufacturing companies in Southwest Nigeria are fraught with major issues, gaps, shortcomings, and challenges.

This knowledge and skills relate not only to the actual work, but also to other aspects of the organisation. James (2015) concurs with Haid (2012) that talent refers to certain individuals who have the skills, knowledge and attributes necessary to carry out tasks in an outstanding way. Elegbe (2020) argued that the term talent has been defined differently in literature. Generally, the term talent is defined as an aptitude, a natural endowment, a mental power or a unique gift Luna-Arocas, & Morley, (2015). According to Romans (2021), some authors define talent as individuals with characteristics that are unique while others view talent as the exceptional skills, abilities, experience, competencies and knowledge that people possess.\nJames and Mathew (2020) identified the critical role that leadership plays in identifying and managing talent. Fitzgerald (2017) suggested that, great leaders refer to talent as a recurring pattern of feelings, thoughts and behaviour that can be applied to the organisation productively. According to Cheese, Thomas and Craig (2008), individuals use these qualities and attributes to achieve goals in the interest of the organisation. Rueff and Stringer (2019) asserted that talent also includes developing individuals\u2019 skill sets to solve problems. Jokotoye (2021) affirmed that talent refers to people who have the ability to make a difference to organisational performance, decision making and service delivery through immediate or long term contributions by demonstrating high level competencies. \nHayes (2019) stated that there is a misconception that talented individuals always perform outstandingly. Kehinde (2019) argued that talent on its own will not make a person stand out, however, it is how it is developed and utilized that enables an individual to perform exceptionally. One common aspect in most definitions is that talent is inborn just like intelligence and not acquired (Elegbe, 2020).   Harris and Williamson (2018) is of the opinion that a common understanding is important of what entails talent so as to create a benchmark for making hiring, developmental and promotional decisions within the organisation. Hayes (2019) concluded that talent is used as an all-encompassing term describing the personnel that organisations need to attract, acquire, develop, promote and retain so as to achieve organisational goals and to perform competitively in the external environment.

Jokotoye (2021) defines talent as individuals capable of significantly enhancing organizational performance, decision-making, and service delivery through their competencies, whether immediately or over the long term.\n\nHowever, Hayes (2019) points out a common misconception that talent invariably results in superior performance. Kehinde (2019) contests that talent alone is insufficient for exceptional performance; it is the development and application of talent that truly empowers an individual to excel. Elegbe (2020) notes that unlike skills which can be acquired, talent is often seen as an inherent trait, similar to intelligence. Harris and Williamson (2018) argue for a unified understanding of talent to inform hiring, development, and promotion decisions within an organization. Concluding, Hayes (2019) defines talent as a comprehensive term that encompasses the personnel an organization must attract, develop, and retain to meet its goals and maintain competitiveness in the marketplace. According to Tanton (2017), the belief in talent and its alignment with the organization's bottom line is central to effective talent management."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.009667259331554783 0.9860870477858261"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Olorunda (2021) submitted that, there is no consensus as to what the term talent management refers to in the academic world. The lack of clarity with regards to the concept of talent management often results in different perceptions arising amongst employees and management (Bayonle, 2013). Devine and Powell (2018) stated that talent management has been a trending topic for management in both the public and private sector. For some organisations, talent is an all-encompassing term which refers to all employees, whilst in other organisations, it is reworded as a skills gap (Mabika, 2016). Blass (2019) emphasized that all organisations practice talent management, however, many organisations often do not have a policy or set procedures to implement and monitor the process. Joubert (2013) argued that to formulate an effective talent management strategy, every organisation should outline the skills and competencies that entails a talented employee. This will depend directly on the organisation\u2019s talent needs and requirements.\nAccording to Thunnisen (2013), the term talent management varies from author to author. Bolarinwa (2015) concurs with Thunnisen (2013) and defined talent management as a proactive process which involves the identification, attraction, retention, development and effective management of a disproportionate number of a high caliber and diverse people, who can be deployed to emerging positions, with the aim of contributing meaningfully to the overall organisational performance. Temidayo (2018), stated that talent management refers to the efforts organisations assert in attracting, selecting, developing and retaining key individuals. Deborah and Jackson (2017) elaborated that the term talent management is also associated with the recruitment and selection of individuals who have the potential to adapt and succeed in the specific job functions within a minimal time frame.\nTalent Management signifies comprehensive and integrated human resource practices with the goal of attracting and retaining the right individuals, for the right positions, at the right time. Talent Management as an area of focus gained currency in 1980s, when an intense need was felt for retaining talented people and curbing attrition. This was when, the companies increasingly realize the immense value of the human assets for organisational success. Different thinkers have defined talent management in many ways. Talent management was merely viewed as the management task of ensuring that right person is placed at the right job at the right time (Jackson & Schuler, 2012). Few years down the line, talent management was seen as a thoughtful and organized effort to ensure leadership continuity by encouraging individual advancement for key positions (Rothwell, 2000; Byham, 2001; Hilton, 2000 & Olsen, 2000 cited in Jokotoye, 2021). Temidayo (2018) viewed talent management as a collection of typical human resource department practices or activities like recruitment, selection, employee development, succession management and career management. As per Joubert (2017) focus of talent management is on identification of the best and the brightest people who can deal with complexities.\nGardner, (2017) identified talent management as a collection of human resource practices like sourcing, selection, employee development and retention. Talent management was taken for identifying key positions which have the potential to differentially impact the competitive advantage of the firm (Cairns, 2019). In a holistic view, Ulrich (2016) defined talent management as identifying individuals having the knowledge, skills and values, who are committed to work and make a difference to organisational success. Talent management is concerned with succession planning or human resource planning i.e. the job flow of employees within an organisation (Kukano, 2019)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Olorunda (2021) pointed out the academic world hasn't reached a consensus on a unified definition of talent management, leading to various interpretations among employees and management (Bayonle, 2013). The concept has become a pervasive subject of interest across both public and private sectors, as mentioned by Devine and Powell (2018). Mabika (2016) noted that in some organizations, 'talent' is a comprehensive term referring to all staff members, whereas in others, it signifies a skills shortage. Blass (2019) highlighted that while all organizations engage in talent management, many lack a formal policy or established practices to guide and evaluate the process adequately. Joubert (2013) recommended that an organization should clearly delineate the skills and competencies characteristic of a 'talented' employee, tailoring this definition to its unique talent needs and objectives.\n\nEchoing the variability in definitions, Thunnisen (2013) observed that interpretations of talent management differ widely among scholars. Bolarinwa (2015) expanded on this by describing talent management as a proactive endeavor focused on identifying, attracting, developing, and managing a select group of high-quality and diverse personnel. These individuals are primed for future pivotal roles, with the intention of significantly contributing to organizational success. Temidayo (2018) further defined it as organizational efforts directed toward the attraction, selection, development, and retention of key personnel. Deborah and Jackson (2017) associated talent management with the processes of recruiting and selecting individuals capable of quickly adapting to and excelling in specific job roles.\n\nTalent management incorporates comprehensive and integrated human resource practices aimed at sourcing and keeping the right individuals in appropriate positions at the ideal time. Originating in the 1980s amid a push to retain talent and minimize turnover, organizations began to acknowledge their human assets' substantial value toward achieving success. According to Jackson & Schuler (2012), talent management initially was seen solely as the process of placing the right person in the right job at the correct time. In the ensuing years, it evolved to include a deliberate effort to ensure leadership continuity and facilitate personal growth for critical roles, as discussed by Rothwell (2000) and others cited in Jokotoye (2021). Temidayo (2018) described it as encompassing typical HR department functions like recruitment, selection, development, succession, and career management. Joubert (2017) stressed its focus on identifying highly capable individuals who can navigate complex challenges effectively.\n\nGardner (2017) identified it as encompassing human resource practices such as talent sourcing, selection, development, and retention. Cairns (2019) viewed it as essential for identifying key roles that significantly influence an organization's competitive advantage. From a comprehensive perspective, Ulrich (2016) defined it as the process of pinpointing individuals with the necessary knowledge, skills, and values committed to working and contributing to the organization's success. Lastly, talent management has been linked with succession planning or human resource planning, involving the strategic movement of employees within an organization (Kukano, 2019)."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.012358977762087834 0.9817951519306704"}, {"role": "user", "content": "In their own view Collings & Mellahi (2019) defined talent management as activities and processes involving systematic identification of key positions in the organisation which contribute to the organisation\u2019s sustainable competitive advantage, developing a talent pool of high potential and high performing incumbents to fill these roles, and the development of these incumbents to ensure their continued commitment to the organisation.\nZaman (2021) defines talent management as managing the entire employee lifecycle from attracting and hiring to promoting and finding a successor upon retirement. It also includes identification of the key gaps between the talent in place and the talent required to drive business success. Devine and Powell (2018) took a narrow view of talent in their study, identified four categories of employees in any organisation, namely, champions, professionals, semi-professionals and amateurs. Professionals, with their extensive quantitative skills and semi-professionals like marketing analysts who apply analytics to business problems are most crucial to business success, because of their scarce and not easily replaceable talent. Professionals and semi-professionals are believed to be most difficult to attract, develop, engage and retain because of the value they bring to organisation (Fapohunda, 2015). They need to be managed differently from other employees. This view links talent management to irreplaceable skills which are critical to organisational success. Some practitioners describe talent management as a key component in effective succession planning while others state talent management an attempt to make all the employees work at the top of their potential (Sanjay, 2017). In conclusion, it can be inferred that talent management encompasses a long list of activity revolving around creation of talent pool. It is the process which includes talent gap analysis, talent identification, talent acquisition, talent development, talent deployment, performance management, talent investigation, talent retention and career planning and succession management of high potential employees with skills which are important to the organisation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Collings and Mellahi (2019) present talent management as a series of activities and processes that strategically identify key positions contributing to an organization's sustainable competitive edge. It involves creating a pool of high potential and high performing individuals ready to fill these roles, coupled with their ongoing development to foster their commitment to the organization.\n\nZaman (2021) views talent management as overseeing the entire employee lifecycle, encompassing the attraction and hiring of individuals, their promotion, and the appointment of their successors upon retirement. This definition extends to spotting the critical gaps between the existing talent and the talent essential for driving business success.\n\nDevine and Powell (2018) offer a more focused perspective on talent, categorizing employees within any organization into champions, professionals, semi-professionals, and amateurs. They underscore the importance of professionals, known for their significant quantitative skills, and semi-professionals like marketing analysts who apply analytics to address business problems. These groups are seen as pivotal to business success due to their rare and irreplaceable expertise. Given their exceptional value to the organization, professionals and semi-professionals present a significant challenge in terms of attraction, development, engagement, and retention, necessitating distinct management approaches from the rest of the workforce.\n\nFrom another perspective, some practitioners regard talent management as an integral part of successful succession planning. In contrast, others view it as an effort to maximize the potential of all employees (Sanjay, 2017). \n\nIn summarizing these viewpoints, it's evident that talent management comprises a comprehensive suite of activities focused on developing a talent reservoir.
