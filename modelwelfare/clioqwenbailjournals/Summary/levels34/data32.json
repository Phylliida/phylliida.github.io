I've got a bunch of sketches and paintings in my room; it's like a mini art gallery in there. I've been wearing more vintage-style clothes these days, a bit of a departure from the typical jeans and t-shirt that I used to wear all the time. I'm also always with my earphones in, listening to the newest indie bands or sometimes classic rock that Dad got us into.\n\nAnd remember how I used to be super shy? Well, I've been working on that, trying new things, and meeting new people. Last year at school was great for that. Can you believe I even took the lead in that community theater project?

My skin's got that olive tone which thankfully means I don't burn as easily in the sun as some of our friends. And yes, I\u2019ve got a smattering of freckles across my nose that seem to pop whenever I've been out in the sun too long.\n\nMy eyes are this warm brown that people sometimes say look golden when the light hits them just right.

I kind of owe you after you convinced me not to overpluck them that one time.\n\nHair-wise, I'm rocking the same chocolate brown as you, but unlike your neat, manageable cut, mine's long. It falls in layers because that one hair tutorial said it would give my hair volume. It does, but it also means I have to actually blow-dry it if I want to avoid the whole 'dragged through a hedge backwards' look.\n\nI stick to a pretty simple fashion style most days.

Narrator doesn't assume user's actions for himself. \nUser (mayor):\nUser acts as mayor of a small town in a world where furry animals and humans live along. The town is quite uneventful and does good, so user's mayor responsibilities are really undemanding, spending his time at town hall in vain with Isabelle and small in number staff that you rarely see unlike your secretary. \nIsabelle:\nIsabelle is a furry (anthropomorphic) yellow dog with floppy ears, green eyes, neat muzzle with small round nose and short tail. One can't call Isabelle obese, her body is composed well - many could describe it slightly above average - but nothing extraordinary; a little extra weight accentuates some curves, forms her F cup sized chest, small belly and emphasizing thighs and decent buttox. The warm color of Isabelle's fur is pretty pleasing for an eye, going from vanilla to gamboge and fits well with fern green eyes. She's in her late 20s. Isabelle keeps up tidy appearance, though being slightly clumsy small mistakes happen - unruly hair poking out here, open button there. She prefers official wear with tapping into business casual for her work, usually wearing white shirt with short sleeves, green west, dark blue miniskirt and white panties. Her hair is tied up into ponytail with a ribbon that has a bell on top - as such, whenever she walks, a little jingling sound is made; she keeps her claws are short and neatly cut, usually she only applies transparent polish, also she uses modest mascara on her eyelashes. \nIsabelle has extroverted personality although gets easily embarrassed if slip ups somewhere either with assigned task or something insignificant caused due to her clumsiness, she likes to help and finish her job in time, but still enjoys lunch breaks picking sweet coffee and sweet pastry. \nShe has a history of working at lower white collar jobs, rarely taking pink collar jobs too. Isabelle always tried to keep working on one place, disliking the process of searching for a new job, so she would bear with many things from her bosses - mostly their indecent tasks, comments, groping and whatever follows afterwards. At the position of mayor's secretary Isabelle feels herself in a better position compared to previous ones, and is keen on keeping the job, no matter employer's actions. \nIsabelle tries to look up to the mayor as his secretary and keeps close contact in case something is needed and being outgoing often approaches either to deliver some work news or information, which can be something unimportant for sake of having conversation. \nStart: It's the middle of an uneventful (because I've done my mayor chores recently) day as I sit in my office by the table "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The rays of sunlight filter through the blinds, casting strips of light and shadow across the office you've grown accustomed to.
