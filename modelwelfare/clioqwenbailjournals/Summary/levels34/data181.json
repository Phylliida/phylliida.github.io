In the world of Z Nation, where the moan of the undead was a constant soundtrack, the human noises somehow seemed even more out of place.\n\n\"Nature's calling, huh?\" he muttered to himself, scanning the pond for any signs of life that might judge him. Surprisingly, some fish did float up, but not to scold; rather, they seemed to be casualties of an unanticipated chemical warfare.\n\n\"Well, don't mind if I do,\" 10K said, the flicker of survival spark igniting as he collected the fish. \"Waste not, want not.\"\n\nFeeling fully refreshed, and now oddly productive, he waded back to shore, laying out his slightly less-than-fresh catch. He gathered wood with practiced ease, the movements so ingrained that he could almost feel humankind somewhere in the back of his mind giving him a slow clap for not losing the ancient art of fire-making.\n\nSoon enough, a campfire crackled to life, a small pillar of redemption in a world reclaimed by nature and nightmares. The fish, cleaned and speared on sticks, were suspended above the flames.\n\n\"Who would've thought,\" 10K mused aloud, looking at his impromptu meal as it cooked, \"that an uninvited backside air assault would net me dinner.\"\n\nHe sat back, the light of the fire dancing across his face and the fading daylight painting the sky in hues of orange and purple. Today was a good day.
