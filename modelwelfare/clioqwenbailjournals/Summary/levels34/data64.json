The vast majority of public schools, who educate a significant portion of students across the country, are appallingly underfunded. Some schools are so economically disadvantaged that basic needs in the modern day school setting, such as installing air conditioning or heating units, having regular maintenance updates such as roof fixtures, or even having technology programs at school, become a struggle to obtain. These schools, therefore, are unable to provide basic necessities and resources to support the quality of education that their students deserve. While one could suggest that there are far more concerning affairs in the status quo, inadequate funding of American public schools simply cannot go ignored. Students are the future of the country. In order to be better equipped to face the challenges of tomorrow, the need for modern technology and suitable learning environments for all students becomes necessary as the world rapidly advances. Yet, because of the mere lack of resources and funding, public schools find it extremely difficult to support their students.

Holistic Development: Extracurricular activities provide students with opportunities to explore their passions and interests outside of the traditional academic curriculum. Engaging in activities like music, sports, clubs, or volunteering allows students to develop their talents, skills, and interests in a well-rounded manner. This holistic development enhances their self-esteem, confidence, and overall sense of identity, which positively impacts their academic performance.\n\n2. Transferable Skills: Extracurricular activities foster the development of important transferable skills such as teamwork, leadership, time management, communication, problem-solving, and resilience. These skills are not only valuable during extracurricular pursuits but also highly applicable in academic settings. Students who actively participate in extracurricular activities often demonstrate improved abilities to manage their time effectively, collaborate with peers, and handle challenges, all of which contribute to their success in the classroom.\n\n3. Enhanced Academic Performance: Engaging in extracurricular activities has been consistently linked to improved academic performance. Students who participate in extracurriculars tend to have higher attendance rates, improved discipline and time management skills, enhanced critical thinking abilities, and increased motivation to succeed academically. These factors contribute to better grades and higher levels of achievement.\n\n4. Personal Growth and Well-being: Extracurricular activities provide a platform for students to explore their passions, build relationships, and develop a sense of belonging. This sense of belonging and connection within a community outside the classroom environment can positively impact their mental and emotional well-being. When students feel supported and engaged in extracurricular pursuits, they often experience reduced stress levels and increased overall satisfaction, leading to improved focus and academic success.\n\n5. College and Career Opportunities: Active involvement in extracurricular activities can significantly impact future college and career opportunities. Extracurricular achievements, leadership roles, and demonstrated commitment to activities showcase important qualities to college admissions officers and potential employers.

The main character carries a pistol and a whip, which can be used for combat and exploration. The player must loot the artifacts, treasures, and bones while protecting themselves from dangerous wildlife, traps, and puzzles. The player builds an oasis in the desert as a base to store equipment, rest, and plan their expeditions. The game would feature inventory and crafting systems, a day/night cycle, special abilities, non-linear progression, and multiplayer mode. Art Design:\n\nThe game will use a low-poly, stylized art design like Albion Online and V Rising. We will use bright colors, set in a desert environment. The character design will include a backpack for carrying gear, clothes to protect against the harsh desert environment, and a range of different weapons and tools. Gameplay Mechanics:\n\nThe player uses pistols and whips to explore various ruins, temples, tombs, pyramids, and other historical sites in the desert. The player can collect materials during their travels and use them to craft weapons, tools, and other useful items. The player will use their survival skills, knowledge, and abilities to overcome obstacles like puzzles, environmental hazards, traps, and dangerous wildlife. The player has access to special abilities that can be unlocked using experience points earned from completing quests, discovering hidden sites, and defeating enemies. The player can progress through the game in a non-linear fashion, taking on side quests or exploring different areas at their own pace. The multiplayer mode will allow players to team up with friends, explore the desert together, and complete quests cooperatively. Project Management:\n\nWe will use Trello as a project management tool to keep track of tasks, progress, and ideas. We will create a rough prototype of the game, designing the main character's movement, interaction, and combat mechanic using simple assets. We will then focus on developing the key mechanics, such as the inventory and crafting system. The game world design will start with a desert oasis and the creation of various sites of interest to explore. We will regularly test and improve the game as we progress through development to ensure a polished final product. That's an overview of the game and a plan for development.\n\nInvestigation System: The player could use an investigation system during their archaeological exploration. The investigation system could provide clues to identify hidden tombs, secret passageways, and hidden artifacts. Players could also gather information on the history and culture of the ruins they are exploring. The investigation system could encourage players to explore each location in-depth and pay attention to every minute historical detail.\n\nAs your character explores various ruins and ancient sites in the desert, they could encounter supernatural entities. The investigation system could be used to gather clues about the creature's weaknesses, habits, and patterns. The player could use this information to create strategies for defeating the creatures.\n\nTrap System: The player could use traps to protect themselves from dangerous wildlife, as well as to catch creatures. Ancient traps could pose a significant threat to relic hunters in Desert Explorer. These traps could range from simple snare traps to booby traps that could cause deadly harm to the player. Players could have the chance to disarm, avoid or set-up traps themselves to catch other treasure hunters in their race to uncovering lost relics.\n\nEquipment and Weapon Customization: The crafting system from your game could be expanded to include a wide range of weapons and equipment, with the player able to modify them using materials found during their expeditions. The weapon and armor customization system could be used as inspiration, allowing the player to modify their gear to fit their playstyle.\n\nCombat: The player could use a variety of weapons and tools to fight supernatural entities, including firearms, melee weapons, and whips. The player could also use special abilities and powers to aid in combat.\n\nNon-linear Progression: The game could feature non-linear progression, allowing the player to explore different areas of the desert and take on quests at their own pace. This would allow for a more immersive experience and encourage exploration.\n\nEnvironmental Hazards: The environment in the Pyramids themselves could pose threats to treasure hunters aside from the ancient traps laid by their architects. Such hazards in the forms of dangerous wildlife, dangerous gases, poor air quality, and lack of visibility can add extra danger and the need for strategic planning for players. The player could face environmental hazards such as sandstorms, extreme heat, and dehydration. These hazards could impact the player's vision, movement, and abilities. Plan ahead and bring the necessary gear to survive in the desert.\n\nAnalysis and Translation System: Players could discover inscriptions and either take them to an expert or translate them themselves with knowledge gained through leveling up. The information these inscriptions contain could point hunters towards previously unseen treasures, add further context to the excavation, or pose greater risks.\n\nArchaeological Tool Kit: Like the gear used in Hellsign, Desert Explorer could include an Archaeological tool kit filled with tools such as brushes, pickaxes, and scanners for player inventory. These tools would enable players to move stones to expose chambers, remove debris to uncover hidden treasures, and discover new cave entrances. Players would also need to repair and maintain the tools to ensure they can work well for their next excavation. Camera and Audio Equipment. \n\nNPC Types and Weaknesses: Npcs in Desert Explorer could come in different types, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The player could use clues to identify the npc type, and once they know the type, they can work out which weapons and equipment to use.\n\nProtective Gear: To protect themselves from the npc, the player would need special clothing designed to keep them safe from npc attacks or to block special attacks. The player may have to craft or purchase this equipment.\n\nEncounters: Player could encounter npcs in ruins within the desert. The player would have to gather information through clues and investigation to identify the npc's weakness and use this knowledge to defeat them.\n\nSupernatural Encounters: In keeping with the theme of ancient cultures and supernatural elements, you could incorporate supernatural haunting and occurrences within the temples, ruins, or pyramids. These ghosts could be powerful spirits that the player must defeat using special weapons, items, or spells that can be crafted using knowledge gathered from translated inscriptions or by learning through experience.\n\nAncient puzzles and Riddles: To add complexity to the exploration process, ancient relics could be hidden behind puzzles and riddles, each of which requires unique thinking and strategizing. In solving these puzzles and riddles, the player may uncover clues that lead to new discoveries, or traps that will obstruct entry into critical areas.\n\nHidden Tombs and Secret Passages: Just like in Hellsign, hidden tombs and secret passages could be incorporated into Desert Explorer. Players could discover these chambers as part of a crucial side quest or accidentally uncover them while doing their usual treasure hunting. The chambers could include caches of gold, precious gems, and invaluable artifacts that change the course of the game. These chambers could also hold untold dangers that can only be overcome with skill and strategy.\n\nEscort Missions: Escorting experts could be a significant challenge in Desert Explorer. These experts could be essential to unlocking hidden rooms or understand the various features of the archaeological sites. The player must keep the experts alive while they complete their respective pursuits. Protecting them from dangers such as wildlife, traps, and spirits will itself provide compelling gameplay mechanics.\n\nMultiplayer Collaboration: Exploration is typically a team effort in archaeology, and Desert Explorer could allow players to work as a team in multiplayer mode. Players could share the tools in their toolkit, collaborate on deciphering translations, and split up the search for treasure across the relic sites. This team endeavor could encourage communication and foster deeper understanding of the history and the cultures of the sites they're exploring.\n\nCultists and Necromancers: Like in Hellsign, Desert Explorer could also include sinister individuals who seek to use the power of ancient relics or corpses for their own evil purposes. Players would need to combat these cultists and necromancers or sabotage their attempts to gain power. The players could learn about these groups from inscriptions, rumors, and investigations, then take them down with weapons, traps, and by using knowledge gleaned about their weaknesses.\n\nTime Limits: Players could face time limits in varying forms, such as extreme heat, oxygen depletion, or a set time limit for each excavation. This time limit would force the players to strategize and plan accordingly beforehand, translating to an adrenaline-fueled rush of exploration and a series of necessary choices on how to proceed.\n\nResearch and Base Building: Similar to Hellsign, players can establish a base in which they can house their findings and gear. In addition, they may have to research new tools, weapons, or high-tech equipment using gathered resources or experience, creating a more streamlined method to collecting items and resources.\n\nMultiple Endings: Depending on the player's narrative choices and decisions, the game may end differently. These endings could vary according to the discovered ancient secrets, the paths players chose to trek, the relics they found and preserved, and the people they saved or defeated in their quest. This leads to an increased replayability, always searching for alternate endings or outcomes for the same ancient sites.\n\nSupernatural Allies: Players could also gain supernatural allies throughout the game, such as the powerful spirits of great pharaohs or powerful gods. These allies could grant the player advantages in combat through abilities or equipment and fuel the progression of the story.\n\nWhip mechanics:\n\nGrappling: The player can use the whip to swing across gaps, climb to higher areas or pull objects closer to them.\n\nCombat: The whip can be used as a mid-range weapon that stuns enemies, breaks shields, and sets traps.\n\nPuzzle Solving: The whip can be used to trigger switches that are out of reach, manipulate levers, and move obstacles.\n\nEnvironmental Interaction: The whip can be used to break open crates, knock over pillars, and create new pathways.\n\nAnimal Control: The player can use the whip to tame and control animals, such as camels or snakes, to aid in exploration and combat.\n\nZip-lining: The player can use the whip to create a zipline to slide down a steep slope or cross a chasm.\n\nStealth: The player can use the whip to disarm traps or grab and pull enemies quietly behind cover without alerting nearby enemies.\n\nPulling heavy objects: The player can use the whip to pull heavy objects such as boulders, statues, or treasure chests.\n\nBlasting open doors: The player can use the whip to grab a nearby explosive barrel and throw it at a locked door or wall to create an opening.\n\nWhirlwind: The player can use the whip to create a whirlwind attack that knocks down nearby enemies, pushes away objects, and extinguishes fires.\n\nHookshot: The player can use the whip as a grappling hook to ascend to high places or to cross over dangerous terrain.\n\nTripwire: The player can use the whip to set a tripwire trap, where enemies will trip and fall, allowing the player to strike them down or sneak past them.\n\nWall-running: The player can use the whip to wall-run and reach high places.\n\nElemental attacks: The player can use the whip to channel elemental energies (e.g., fire, lightning, ice) to attack enemies or melt ice barriers.\n\nShield breaking: The player can use the whip to break the shields of certain enemies, making them vulnerable to attacks.\n\n\n\n\nDigging mechanic:\n\nExcavation: The player can use a shovel or other digging tool to excavate various archaeological sites, tombs, and ruins. This can uncover secret areas, valuable artifacts, and treasure.\n\nBuried Treasure: The player can use a metal detector to locate buried treasure in the desert or around ruins. However, they must be careful not to disturb protected or historically significant sites.\n\nTraps: As the player digs, they may encounter traps such as pit traps or falling debris. The player must navigate these dangers to safely excavate the area.\n\nCrafting Resources: The player can collect crafting resources such as minerals, gems, or clay by digging or scavenging through the desert sand.\n\nGrappling Hook: The player can use a grappling hook to excavate areas that may be out of reach or hidden behind a wall.\n\nBreath Meter: The player must keep track of their breath meter while digging in underground areas. If they dig for too long without returning to the surface for air, they risk running out of air and losing health.\n\nWeather System: During sandstorms, the player can use the digging tool or shovel to dig in search of shelter, but also to uncover valuable artifacts and shelter materials.\n\nPuzzle Solving: The player can use digging as part of a puzzle-solving mechanic. For example, they may need to dig out a hidden object or create a tunnel to reach a new area.\n\nBurrowing Animals: The player can encounter burrowing animals such as scorpions or snakes while digging. They can avoid or defeat them using weapons and tools.\n\nCaving: The player may encounter underground caves and tunnels while digging. These areas can contain valuable resources or lead to new areas of the map.\n\nDynamite: The player can use dynamite to blast open a path, uncover hidden areas, or overcome obstacles.\n\nWater System: The player can dig underground water channels and wells to provide a source of water and help sustain their desert oasis.\n\nExhaustion: The player's digging tool or shovel may degrade or break over time, requiring periodic replacement or repair.\n\nSand Mechanics: The player must keep track of sand mechanics, such as shifting sands, quicksand, and sinkholes that can pose hazards while digging.\n\nStatistics: The game could incorporate statistics that record the amount of time spent digging, total loot found, and total distance dug.\n\nWhack-a-mole style: The player must use their digging tool to dig up hidden treasure or artifacts while avoiding underground critters like burrowing scorpions, snakes, or beetles that may come up from the sand. The goal is to collect as many valuable goods as possible before time runs out.\n\nJigsaw-style puzzle: The player must dig up a puzzle piece hidden in a specific area of the desert and use it to solve a larger puzzle. Each time the player finds a puzzle piece, it unlocks a new clue or hint that helps them complete the larger puzzle.\n\nSensor mini-game: The player must use their metal detector to locate specific metal objects buried beneath the sand. They have to follow the sensor's beeping and digging carefully in the right spots to uncover the treasure before time runs out.\n\nMinesweeper-style: The player must carefully dig in the right spots and avoid hidden pitfalls and traps like pit traps or quicksand. The objective is to dig a specific distance while avoiding these deadly errors.\n\nMemory match: The player must use their digging tool to turn over wooden plaques buried in the sand. They must match pairs of them, uncovering rewards under each matched pair.\n\nSandcastle building: The player must use their digging and building skills to construct a sandcastle in a limited time period. The size and complexity of the sandcastle determine the player's score.\n\nDigging race: The player competes against an AI or other players in a race to see who can dig the most treasure in a limited time period.\n\nTreasure hunt: The player must follow a treasure map and use their digging tool to dig at various marked locations until they find all the treasure.\n\nFossil excavation: The player must use their digging tool to carefully excavate ancient fossils from the sand, avoiding damaging the fragile remains.\n\nGem matching: The player must use their digging tool to uncover gems buried in the sand and match them in a game of gem swapping, similar to Bejeweled.\n\n\n\n\n\nMechinic ideas for whip:\n\nCombat: The whip can be used as a melee weapon in combat, with varying ranges and damage output to suit different playstyles. The player could use the whip to grab enemies, pull them towards the player, and initiate combos.\n\nPuzzle-solving: The whip could also be a tool used to solve puzzles in ruins, temples, and tombs. Mechanic-wise, this whip mechanic operates as an extended arm that can be used to interact with objects from a distance. Examples could include pulling levers, moving items, and pressing buttons that are out of reach.\n\nGrappling and traversal: Players can use the whip to swing and climb between platforms to reach tricky locations and explore ruins. They could swing from one platform to another, tightrope across gaps, rappel down walls, and leap up the face of high walls. This mechanic can involve utilizing physics, timing, and accuracy to perform.\n\nEnemy Wrangling:\n\nWhip puzzles:\n\nSwitch Activator: The player must use their whip to pull a switch or lever that will activate a door or gate in another location.\n\nCoiling: The player must use their whip to coil the whip around poles, pillars or statues to solve puzzles requiring weight, and counterweight mechanisms.\n\nMidair Whip: The player must use their whip while jumping midair to reach areas that are otherwise inaccessible.\n\nFuse Ignition: The player must use their whip to light up a fuse leading to a bomb or explosive barrel placed near a wall or a barrier.\n\nLine of Sight: The player must use their whip to create a path between lined up points hidden behind obstacles to enable the laser beams to pass.\n\nPressure Plate: The player must use their whip to pull a heavy object to a pressure plate, causing a door or gate to open.\n\nBalance Beam: The player must use their whip to balance themselves while walking on a narrow beam or rope.\n\nSwing Puzzle: The player must use their whip to swing across gaps between platforms, while also avoiding obstacles, enemies or hazards.\n\nBlock Pushing: The player must use their whip to move blocks around the level to create a path or solve other puzzles.\n\nChasm Crossing: The player must use their whip to swing across chasms, grab onto floating rocks or other objects, and make their way across with precision timing.\n\nObstacle Course: The player must navigate through a challenging obstacle course, using their whip to avoid obstacles and navigate through tight spaces.\n\nWall Climbing: The player must use their whip to climb up walls, create handholds, or swing around corners to reach higher areas and solve puzzles.\n\nMaze Navigation: The player must use their whip to create new paths or remove obstacles as they navigate their way through a maze.\n\nMoving Platforms: The player must use their whip to swing to and from moving platforms, avoid hazards or enemies in the environment and get through to the end.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To further enhance the gameplay of \"Desert Explorer,\" we can implement various mechanics involving the whip. One such mechanic includes enemy wrangling, where the player can use the whip to grab enemies or animals and control them. The player can use this ability to ride camels or other animals, or to attack enemies from a distance using the enemy's own strength.\n\nAdditionally, we can introduce different whip puzzles that require the player to use their whip in different ways. These puzzles can involve swinging, climbing, and coiling the whip around objects to trigger different mechanisms. Such puzzles can add a layer of challenge and creativity to the game and give players a sense of accomplishment when they complete them.\n\nOther potential whip mechanics include fuse ignition, line of sight puzzles, pressure plates, balancing on beams, and traversing chasms.

Egeus wants Hermia to marry Demetrius, but she is in love with Lysander. Hermia and Lysander decide to run away together, and Hermia confides in her friend Helena, who is in love with Demetrius. Helena, hoping to win Demetrius's favor, tells him about Hermia and Lysander's plan.\nMeanwhile, a group of mechanicals, including a weaver named Nick Bottom, meet in the woods to rehearse a play they are to perform at the wedding of Theseus and Hippolyta. In the woods, Oberon and Titania have an argument about a changeling boy that Oberon wants for himself but Titania refuses to give up. Oberon decides to get his revenge on Titania and sends his servant Puck to find a flower that has the power to make someone fall in love with the first living thing they see when they wake up.\nDemetrius chases Hermia into the woods, and is followed by Helena. Oberon sees Demetrius and Helena arguing and decides to help Helena by using the potion on Demetrius. However, Puck mistakenly uses the potion on Lysander, causing him to fall in love with Helena instead of Hermia. This leads to a series of comedic misunderstandings and mishaps as the four lovers try to navigate their conflicting feelings.\nIn the end, Oberon lifts the spell, and the lovers are reunited with their true partners. The mechanicals perform their play, Pyramus and Thisbe, to the delight of the wedding guests. The play ends with a blessing from the fairies and a reminder that all the events of the night were just a dream.\nThe plot of A Midsummer Night's Dream explores themes of love, deception, and the power of the supernatural, all set against the backdrop of a magical forest.

(2021). Employee resourcing aspect takes a look on the crucial attributes of knowledge, skills and abilities of the organisational talents and ensures that the organisations gets them right the first time. The RBV theory further explains how a firm can perform better when it combines its unique resources to drive all the areas of the organisation which results to a sustainable competitive advantage through the adoption of strategies (Oga & Chima, 2020). The RBV theory further explains that organisations competitive advantage can only be maintained through possession of unique resources which can also provide superior performance at the same time and which can only be arrived at though talent management of the individual employees (Wright, 2019). The RBV theory emphasizes that organisations should add more value to their resources in a manner that is unique and not easy for competitors to imitate (Ling & Jaw, 2019).  It is in this view that Robinson (2019) observed that when employees are developed they become more committed hence becoming unique assets to the organisation by enabling the organisation to have an edge over the competitor. The strength of RBV theory is that it puts stress on exploring how employees as resources are generated, and how their unique talents are maintained and developed for employee performance, hence, being a relevant theory for this current study.\nRBV theory therefore advocates for the management the employees talents which results to getting the resources that qualify to be sources of competitive advantage which must be rare, strategic, inimitable, non-substitutable, appropriate and immobile which can only be achieved by developing the employees\u2019 talent (Snell, 2017). Public and private organisation should advocate for management of their unique talents (Carthigh, 2019) through a wider understanding of resource base theory and its significance. The theorist  suggest to  the managers to develop unique resources and assumes that the managers have the capability of  developing such resources which is an elution of the powers that the managers have and further over estimating the managers capability to control human resources or even predict the future business fortune. Although resource base theory emphasizes on the attraction, retention and management of the most competent workforce but has been criticized on the premises that very little has been explored in relation to which exact practices the theorists would advocate to be embraced for maintaining the talents for long in the workplace (Armstrong, 2012). RBV theory lacks a lot of managerial implication (Wright, McMahan & McWilliams, 2009). Notwithstanding, the major thrust of this theory is relevant to this study."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Workers within a company are often referred to as invaluable assets, and these assets form the basis of a lasting competitive edge (Vaiman 2012 in Bashir and others, 2021). When examining the employee resourcing side, there's a focus on the essential characteristics of knowledge, skills, and abilities of the company's workforce, emphasizing the importance of achieving these attributes correctly from the outset. The Resource-Based View (RBV) theory elaborates on how an organization can outperform others by leveraging its distinctive resources across all operational facets, thus achieving a sustainable competitive advantage through strategic implementations (Oga & Chima, 2020). Moreover, the RBV theory posits that an organization\u2019s competitive edge is preserved by having unique resources that concurrently offer superior performance and are harnessed through effective talent management of its employees (Wright, 2019). The RBV theory underlines the importance for organizations to enhance their resources in ways that are distinct and challenging for rivals to replicate (Ling & Jaw, 2019). From this perspective, Robinson (2019) noted that through the development of employees, they become more devoted, thereby transforming into distinct assets that provide the company with a superiority over competitors. The essence of the RBV theory lies in its focus on the creation, preservation, and enhancement of employees' unique abilities for improved performance, making it a pertinent theory for this analysis.\n\nConsequently, the RBV theory promotes the management of employees\u2019 talents, leading to attaining resources characterized as rare, strategic, inimitable, non-substitutable, suitable, and immovable, achievable solely through nurturing the employees' talents (Snell, 2017). Organizations, both public and private, are encouraged to manage their distinctive talents (Carthigh, 2019) by thoroughly comprehending the resource-based theory and its importance. The theory prompts managers to cultivate unique resources and presupposes their ability to do so, suggesting an overvaluation of the managerial power to shape human resources and to foresee future business outcomes. Even though the resource-based theory highlights the attraction, retention, and management of supremely skilled employees, it is critiqued for the minimal exploration into the specific tactics theorists recommend for retaining talent within the workplace over time (Armstrong, 2012). The RBV theory is noted for its minimal managerial implications (Wright, McMahan & McWilliams, 2009). Nevertheless, the core argument of this theory remains pertinent to the current study."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.006661648504573868 0.9886760719629797"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The concept of intellectual capital has topped the management agenda in recent years and it was put forward by Adam smith. Plant, machinery and other forms of capital are now recognized to account for only a fraction of an organisation\u2019s wealth. The rest of that wealth is bound up in the knowledge, skills, abilities and intellect of the people of the organisation, and their willingness and ability to apply them in the pursuit of organisational goals (Armstrong, 2010 cited in Oyedeji, 2020). The theory of intellectual capital is closely related to what human resource management practices attempts to achieve in terms of building and maintaining the human capital resources required by the firm (Bridger, 2014). It also encompasses the development of structure to ensure that people work effectively together and that they exchange relevant information and ideas and make the best use of the resources of knowledge possessed by the organisation (Boxall & Purcell, 2015).\nIntellectual capital consists of the stocks and flows of knowledge, ability, skill and competencies available to an organisation (Burbach & royle, 2017). These can be regarded as intangible resources which together with tangible resources (money and physical assets) comprise the market or total value generating processes of a firm and are under its control. As described by James (2015), these incorporate the value of all relationships inside and outside the organisation including those with customers and suppliers. They also cover the values attached to such intangibles as goodwill, corporate image and brands.\nThe three elements of intellectual capital by Vaiman (2002) are human capital, social capital and organisational capital. Human capital at the micro-level refers to the knowledge, skills and abilities of the employees in an organisation and can be made by developing existing staff through training and development or bought by attracting new staff with the skills and knowledge required so as to get the right human capital the first time (Cappelli, 2008). This in addition makes employees feel valued and in return have a sense of commitment in their organisational undertakings. Social capital on the other hand refers to the stocks and flows of knowledge derived from networks of relationships within and outside the organisation. It may also refer to the structure within which human capital is most effectively deployed, and includes the use of communication, involvement and other initiatives to facilitate the exchange of knowledge (Esu, 2019).\nOluyemi and Adeku (2020) defined organisational capital as the institutionalized knowledge possessed by an organisation that is stored in databases and manuals. He in addition says that he prefers the concept of organisational capital to others because it conveys clearly that this is the knowledge that the organisation actually owns. Organisational capital is most likely to be the object of knowledge management systems as organisations strives to find better ways to capture, store and use knowledge effectively (Carins, 2009 cited in Akinremi& Adedeji, 2019).\nIn addition, in the process of placing and orienting these new hires into the organisation, employees are able to communicate and exchange ideas amongst themselves as a way of exercising the social capital in the organisation. The human resource manager conducts the training need analysis of employees in order to know the employees to be trained and the areas to be trained on so as to instill knowledge, skills and abilities (Lew, 2013)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The notion of intellectual capital has emerged as a primary focus in the realm of management in recent times, with its origination attributed to Adam Smith. It's now acknowledged that an organization's wealth isn't merely derived from tangible assets like plant and machinery, but significantly from the collective knowledge, skills, abilities, and intellectual prowess of its personnel, coupled with their readiness and capability to deploy these in achieving organizational objectives (Armstrong, 2010 as referenced in Oyedeji, 2020). Intellectual capital theory aligns closely with the objectives of human resource management practices, which aim to cultivate and preserve the human capital necessary for the organization's needs (Bridger, 2014). Additionally, it involves creating an organizational structure conducive to effective teamwork and the free exchange of pertinent information and ideas, maximizing the organization's knowledge resources (Boxall & Purcell, 2015).\n\nIntellectual capital is made up of the knowledge, skills, abilities, and competencies an organization possesses (Burbach & Royle, 2017). These intangible assets, in conjunction with tangible assets like financial and physical resources, contribute to a firm's market value and fall under its management. James (2015) elaborated that this includes the worth of all internal and external relationships, encompassing interactions with customers and suppliers, and extends to intangibles like goodwill, corporate identity, and brand values.\n\nAccording to Vaiman (2002), intellectual capital comprises three components: human capital, social capital, and organizational capital. Human capital pertains to the individual-level attributes of knowledge, skills, and abilities of employees, which can be developed through training or enhanced by recruiting new talent possessing essential skills and knowledge, thereby securing the desired human capital from the outset (Cappelli, 2008). This approach also serves to make employees feel appreciated, fostering their commitment to organizational tasks. Social capital involves the knowledge that emerges from networks of relationships both within and outside the organization. It also refers to the frameworks that enable optimal utilization of human capital, incorporating communication, engagement, and other methods to promote knowledge sharing (Esu, 2019).\n\nOrganizational capital, as defined by Oluyemi and Adeku (2020), refers to the institution-specific knowledge contained within databases and manuals, representing the intellectual property of an organization. This form of capital is often targeted by knowledge management systems, aiming to enhance the capture, storage, and application of knowledge (Carins, 2009 in Akinremi & Adedeji, 2019).\n\nMoreover, the integration and orientation of new employees into an organization facilitate the exchange and communication of ideas, leveraging the entity's social capital.

It entails attracting new talent equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge.

He argued that there are three core needs which he classified as Existence needs, Relatedness and Growth needs (Alderfer, 1972) cited in Adedayo (2017). ER is a motivational construct concerned with understanding the factors that contribute to individual human behaviour. It is one of four content approaches that consider the intrinsic factors that cause a person to take specific actions (Idris, 2014). Such understanding is useful to management students and practitioners seeking to understand and improve performance in the workplace. Existence needs has to do with the satisfaction of basic needs such as food, water, pay and working conditions, they can be classified as physical, safety and material needs. Physiological needs refer to an individual\u2019s pursuit of satisfaction at the vitality level, such as leisure, exercise, sleep, Safety needs mainly refer to the prevention from fear, anxiety, threat, danger, tension, Material needs refer to resources required for an individual\u2019s living, including food and clothing \nThe Relatedness needs is similar to the social role needs of Maslow\u2019s theory and they includes social and interpersonal relationship. It also includes sense of security, belonging, and respect. Sense of security involves the mutual trust of humanity. Sense of belonging refers to prevention from all forms of suffering, such as isolation, loneliness and distance. People normally wish to be accepted and become members of a group. The needs for belongingness include love given to others or caring accepted from others. Sense of respect simply means feeling of respect from others, such as popularity, social status, superiority, importance and compliment. Such form of need gives people value to their existence (Ivancevich, 2019).\nFinally, the Growth need is intrinsic desire for personal development or making creative productive contribution. It involves needs for self-esteem and self-actualization. The need for self-esteem refers to self-productive effects such as the ability to pursue, to seek knowledge, to achieve, to control, to build confidence, to be independent and to feel competent. Self-actualization refers to self-accomplishments including achieving an individual\u2019s goals and developing his or her personality. The abilities to realize one\u2019s potentials and to support the growth of others are also included. Snell  (2018) argued that if the gratification of a higher level order need is stifled, the desire to satisfy a lower level need increase i.e. frustration, regression and dimension The thrust of the theory is that when needs in a higher category are not met then the individuals redouble the efforts invested in a lower category need. The needs do not have to be met sequentially. The theory is very relevant to this theory because, Vroom\u2019s expectation theory suggested what can be done to motivate employees. It\u2019s been observed that there is a high increase in the level of job performance and reduce employee turnover intentions when employees are properly motivated.

This motivation framework focuses on identifying factors that influence individual behavior. It is one of the content theories emphasizing intrinsic elements that propel individuals towards certain behaviors (Idris, 2014). Such insights prove valuable for management students and practitioners aiming to bolster workplace performance. Existence needs encompass basics like sustenance, hydration, compensation, and working conditions, aligning with physiological, safety, and material requirements. These involve seeking pleasure in activities like leisure and sleep, ensuring personal safety from threats, and securing essentials for living such as food and clothing.\n\nRelatedness needs echo Maslow\u2019s social needs, covering aspects like social bonds and personal relationships. This dimension embraces the quest for a security sense through mutual trust, a sense of belonging to evade isolation, and the need for esteem through acknowledgment from others, such as recognition, status, and validation. These needs affirm one's place and worth within a social context (Ivancevich, 2019).\n\nGrowth needs reflect an innate urge for self-improvement and contributing creatively. This category includes desires for self-regard and self-realization, covering the drive for achievement, knowledge acquisition, self-reliance, competence, and realizing individual aspirations and potential. This facet also involves fostering others' development. According to Snell (2018), frustration or obstruction in fulfilling an advanced need intensifies the effort toward satisfying more fundamental needs, suggesting that the gratification of needs doesn't necessarily follow a sequential order but adapts based on circumstances.\n\nThe essence of Alderfer's theory highlights the concept that unmet higher-tier needs prompt a revisited focus on more basic categories of need. This nonlinear approach underscores the adaptability of human motivation, aligning with Vroom's expectancy theory, which delves into how to incentivize employees effectively. Observations indicate that well-motivated employees exhibit enhanced job performance and reduced turnover intentions, leading to a generally positive work attitude and heightened organizational productivity and efficiency."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.005201155761047575 0.9911647638226563"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The Expectancy Theory was propounded by Victor H. Vroom. Vroom\u2019s expectancy theory was an attempt to describe how an individual\u2019s motivation to achieve a particular goal or performance target can be explained in terms of what outcome would become beneficial to the individual as a result of achieving that goal and what value is placed on that outcome (Amir, 2015). Vroom's theory is based on the belief that employee\u2019s effort will lead to performance and performance will lead to rewards (Vroom, 1964 cited Anyadike, 2020). Essentially, the expectancy theory argues that the strength of a tendency to act in a certain way depends on the strength of the expectation that the act will be followed by a given outcome and on the attractiveness of that outcome to the individual (Robbins, 1989) cited in Adedayo (2017). According to Idemobi (2010), the Expectancy Theory is a process theory that was developed to basically concentrate on the outcomes. What Vroom explained in his theory is that in order to motivate employees or people, the effort put in by the lecturers, the performance generated and motivation must be linked to one another. According to Vroom, employee\u2019s expectations can affect an individual\u2019s motivation. Therefore, the amount of effort lecturers   exert on a specific task depends on their expectations of the outcome.\nAccording to Robbins (1989), the expectancy theory includes three variables or relationships which are attractiveness, performance-reward linkage and the effort-performance linkage. Attractiveness explains the importance that the individual places on the potential outcome or reward that can be achieved on the job. This considers the unsatisfied needs of the individual. Performance-reward linkage is the degree to which the individual believes that performing at a particular level will lead to the attainment of a desired outcome. Effort-performance linkage explains the perceived probability by the individual that exerting a given amount of effort will lead to performance. These three factors according to Vroom combine and create a \u201cforce\u201d which stimulates or motivates an individual to put in effort in order to achieve a level of performance and then obtain end rewards. This type of theory distinguishes between the most motivated, and the least motivated employees (Reed, 2009). Expectancy explains that the belief of a person that his/her effort (E) will result in attainment of desired performance (P) goals. Instrumentally: P->R. the belief of a person that he/she will receive a reward if the performance (P) expectation is met. Valance is then the value of the reward according to the person (is the reward attractive to the person)\nThe expectancy theory of motivation has been the target of many critics (Cole, 2013). One of the major criticisms was its simplicity. In the sense that it does not explain the different levels of efforts acted out by an individual. There is also the assumption that a reward will entice an employee to expand greater efforts in order to obtain the reward, but neglect the fact that the reward in question could have a negative effect for the individual. For example, a pay increase might push him or her into a higher tax bracket (Lawler, 1967; Porter, 1968 cited in David, 2018). The effectiveness of the expectancy theory from a managerial perspective relies on the manager to make assumptions on the motivational force of the reward for the employee (s). Thus, the use of rewards needs to obey \u201cthe law of effect\u201d where: positively rewarded behaviors will have a tendency to augments in frequency, negatively or neutrally reward behaviors will have a tendency to diminish in frequency and the type of reinforcement and its timing will impact the frequency of the behaviour. Thus, a particular reward can fulfill multiple outcomes, consequently adding to the sum of the valences."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Victor H. Vroom's Expectancy Theory is a framework aiming to illustrate how an individual's motivation to reach a specific goal or achievement is influenced by the anticipated benefit of the outcome and the value attributed to it by the individual (Amir, 2015). Rooted in the idea that an employee's effort leads to performance, and performance to rewards (Vroom, 1964 as mentioned by Anyadike, 2020), the theory posits that the likelihood of an individual acting in a certain manner is tied to the expectation of a particular outcome and the desirability of this outcome for the person (Robbins, 1989 in Adedayo, 2017). Idemobi (2010) characterizes the Expectancy Theory as a process-oriented theory, focusing on outcomes and linking the efforts and performance of individuals, such as lecturers, to motivation. Vroom suggests that an employee\u2019s expectations shape their motivation, and thus, the effort they put into a task depends on their anticipated outcomes.\n\nRobbins (1989) outlines three key components or relationships within the expectancy theory: attractiveness, performance-reward linkage, and effort-performance linkage. Attractiveness refers to the value an individual places on the potential reward or outcome achievable through their work, addressing the person\u2019s unmet needs. Performance-reward linkage assesses the extent to which the individual believes that achieving a certain level of performance will result in obtaining a desired outcome. The effort-performance linkage considers the individual\u2019s belief in the likelihood that exerting a particular amount of effort will lead to the anticipated performance. Collectively, these factors generate a motivational \"force\" encouraging an individual to exert effort to reach a performance level that results in gaining rewards, distinguishing between the most and least motivated employees (Reed, 2009). Essentially, expectancy denotes a person's belief that their effort (E) will achieve desired performance (P) goals, leading to the attainment of rewards (P->R), and valence embodies the attractiveness of the reward to the individual.\n\nHowever, Vroom's Expectancy Theory has encountered several criticisms, such as its simplicity and failure to account for the varying levels of effort individuals may exert (Cole, 2013). Critics argue that it assumes rewards universally entice employees to exert more effort, without considering how some rewards might negatively impact an individual. For instance, a pay raise could inadvertently result in an employee being moved to a higher tax bracket, presenting a less appealing outcome (Lawler, 1967; Porter, 1968 in David, 2018). The effectiveness of this theory from a managerial standpoint requires assumptions about how motivational a reward is for an employee. The application of rewards should adhere to \"the law of effect\": behaviors that are positively rewarded are likely to increase in frequency, whereas those that are negatively or neutrally rewarded are likely to decrease. Additionally, the nature and timing of reinforcement influence behavior frequency, with a single reward potentially fulfilling multiple outcomes, thus affecting the overall valence sum."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.007547603720491808 0.9885408044397875"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Adams' Equity Theory, also known as the Equity Theory of Motivation, was propounded in 1963 by John Stacey Adams, a Belgian psychologist known for workplace behaviour. Equity theory of motivation seeks to balance an employee's contribution and output in the workplace. If the employee can strike the correct balance, it will result in a more productive relationship with management.\nEquity is the art of one individual being fair and impartial in social interactions with another individual (Adams, 1963 cited in Francis, 2014). It is an art because it requires an individual to have a skill. The skill resists the ease that comes with selfish interests in order to facilitate an effective relationship with another individual\u2019s goals in mind. Adams (1963) cited Haid (2012), posits that Equity is achieved when the ratio of employee outcomes over inputs is equal to other employee outcomes over inputs\nAdams' Equity theory states that employees strive for equity between themselves and other workers (Davies, 2010). Equity theory recognizes that individuals are concerned not only with the absolute amount of rewards they receive for their efforts, but also with the relationship of this amount to what others receive. They make judgments as to the relationship between their inputs and outcomes and the inputs and outcomes of others. Based on one\u2019s inputs such as effort, experience, education and competence; one compares outcomes such as salary levels, raises, recognition and other factors.\n When people perceive an imbalance in their input-outcome ratio relative to others, tension is created. This tension provides the basis for motivation, as people strive for what they perceive as equity and fairness (Robbins, 1989 cited in Faruna, 2018). The theory investigates an individual\u2019s perceived fairness of an employment situation and find that there are perceived inequalities, he/she would change behaviour and may go further to take action to seek a redress of the in balance. This redress may be in any of the four ways: increase outputs (by working harder, attend training courses, or go for further education), decrease inputs (by working less, refuse to take as much responsibility, or be so obliging to help others), and increase outcomes (aim for extrinsic benefits such as requesting for more pay, extra holidays etc.) and quit (resign from the job, absenteeism). Equity theory has helped organisation address the issue of injustice, partiality, and unfairness."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "John Stacey Adams' Equity Theory, formulated in 1963, is a foundational concept in understanding workplace behavior, specifically focusing on the dynamics of employee motivation through fairness and equity. This theory underscores the importance of achieving a balance between what an employee contributes to their workplace and what they receive in return. When this balance is attained, it fosters a more productive and harmonious relationship between employees and management.\n\nEquity, as Adams described, is the practice of being fair and impartial during social interactions (Adams, 1963 as mentioned in Francis, 2014). It necessitates a skillful approach where an individual resists personal bias and selfish motives to prioritize an effective relationship that considers the objectives of others. According to Adams (cited in Haid, 2012), equity is realized when the ratio of an employee\u2019s outcomes to inputs matches that of their peers.\n\nAdams posited that employees naturally seek parity with their colleagues in terms of rewards and recognition (Davies, 2010). The Equity Theory acknowledges that workers evaluate not just the total rewards they receive but also how these rewards compare to those received by others. This comparison takes into account their own contributions, such as effort, skill, experience, and education, against the rewards received, which may include salary, promotions, and acknowledgment.\n\nWhen individuals perceive a disparity in the ratio of their contributions to rewards relative to others, it generates tension. This tension acts as a motivational driver, propelling individuals to seek what they perceive as equity and justice (Robbins, 1989 as cited in Faruna, 2018). If an employee perceives an inequity in their work situation, they might alter their behavior to address this perceived imbalance. Actions taken might include increasing their outputs (through additional effort, undergoing training, or further education), reducing their inputs (by diminishing their workload, avoiding responsibilities, or lessening their cooperativeness), seeking to improve their outcomes (negotiating for higher pay or more vacation time), or opting to exit the organization altogether (through resignation or increased absenteeism).\n\nEquity Theory has been instrumental for organizations in recognizing and ameliorating issues related to injustice, bias, and unfair treatment, guiding them in creating workplaces that strive for fairness and equity among employees."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.006664727265171846 0.9891334094580606"}, {"role": "user", "content": "In 2001, Mitchell et al.

They further proposed that job embeddedness represented a unique factor in understanding why people stay at their jobs and discussed ways in which employers can influence employees' embeddedness and propensity to stay. They recommended examining three components-links, fit, and sacrifice-each in an organisational and community context. It is this examination of both the organisation and community that makes job embeddedness unique in helping explain employee retention.\nIn Mitchell et aI.

More so, where employees are not denied free access to information, there will be improved in their job performance.\nFurthermore, the perception those employees attach to human resource management practices vary depending on employees' interpretations of an employer's underlying motivation (Nishii et al., 2008).

The scholars explained that job embeddedness itself doesn\u2019t directly cause personal life decisions such as getting married or buying a house, but rather these life decisions contribute to an individual's degree of embeddedness (p. 25). Moreover, they suggested that job embeddedness offers a distinctive lens through which to understand employee retention, urging companies to consider the elements of links, fit, and sacrifice within both the organizational and community spheres to enhance employees' inclination to stay.\n\nIn their seminal study on job embeddedness, Mitchell et al. employed statistical methods to demonstrate that job embeddedness could predict employee turnover more effectively than traditional indicators such as job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and intent to stay (Mitchell et al., 2001, p. 30). They argued that previous frameworks focusing on job satisfaction and organizational commitment fell short of fully explaining why individuals remain with an organization because they overlooked the impact of an employee's life outside work.\n\nThe significance of job embeddedness theory in this context is that when manufacturing industries implement comprehensive talent management strategies \u2013 encompassing human resource planning, accurate recruitment and selection, employee development, performance-based rewards, equitable access to professional training, and transparent performance appraisals \u2013 employees' morale and performance, particularly in high-stakes corporate environments, are likely to improve.

Positive employee responses are more likely when they believe that their employer is genuinely committed to implementing favorable human resources management practices. Conversely, if employees perceive that these practices serve primarily the employers' interests, their reactions may not be as favorable (Wright, 2014).

Findings revealed that adequate talent management strategy is needed to enhance performance in public sector organisations as it will help in the maintenance of core competencies, employees' retention, commitment, increase productivity, as well as lower recruitment costs. The study concludes that no matter the quality and quantity of resources spent on skills sharpening, career support, innovation, training, etc. if adequate strategies are not developed to manage talents within an organisation, more resources will be spent on talent acquisition regularly without corresponding results. The study recommends that the process of having a talented workforce should begin from the acquisition (hiring) stage and should flow through the compensation and retention stages. Thus, public organisations should, at all times, identify areas that talent replacements are needed, as well as develop the skills and competencies of the employees to take up leadership roles in the future or when the need arises.
