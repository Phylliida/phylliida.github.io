This realization came to me when I had to take my entrance exam for university with a broken hand. Despite the pain and frustration, I persisted and managed to write for four hours. This determination paid off, as I was proudly accepted into the field of dentistry. After graduation, I began working in a small city around Shiraz, hoping to fulfill my dreams of serving people while being financially secure. However, I soon discovered that the reality of the dental industry was far from my ideals. Most dental clinics were run by businessmen focused on their own profits rather than the well-being of patients or even the doctors themselves. I found myself working in places where the managers did not pay salaries on time and insisted on using low-quality dental materials. The economic struggles of the people worsened, and demands for tooth extractions increased. I realized that the situation would not improve, and I felt helpless as I was unable to provide the treatments that my family and friends needed. It was clear that this environment was not sustainable, and I knew it would only last for a short time. After working for almost two and a half years, I made the difficult decision to migrate. The financial issues at my workplace, combined with the rapidly changing exchange rates, led to a serious sickness and uncertainty about my future. The rising cost of living and the limitations imposed by economic sanctions made it impossible for me to continue my education or open my own private dental practice. In a desperate attempt to seek a better future, I contacted the University of North Carolina and explained my situation. As a child, I had always imagined myself staying close to my family and roots. However, witnessing the decline of dental clinics and the decrease in the number of patients made me rethink my plans. I realized that even after a year of working six days a week, I could not afford to buy a simple car. Considering the rising inflation rate, it seemed impractical to open my own practice before reaching the age of 40. It was evident that I needed to migrate to the US in order to expand my knowledge, gain new skills, and learn about the latest world standard treatments. This would enable me to feel fulfilled and continue serving people without the constant financial and professional struggles I faced in Iran. Additionally, observing the mismanagement of clinics in Iran motivated me to apply for the leadership in practice program at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. Although I was accepted into seven other schools, I chose this particular university because of the kind and supportive advisor, Dr. Evarts, and the opportunity to receive training on how to run a healthcare system. This program will equip me with the necessary skills to fulfill my dream of running dental clinics that provide quality treatments while also being financially sustainable. My goal is to design a system that is both profitable and morally sound, prioritizing the well-being of patients and their health. In summary, my determination, rather than just my intelligence, has been a crucial factor in my journey. It has allowed me to overcome challenges and push forward in pursuing my dreams. I am now excited to embark on this new chapter of my life, where I can gain new skills, expand my knowledge, and work towards creating a dental healthcare system that values both profitability and the well-being of patients. After graduation, I had the opportunity to work as a research assistant. This position allowed me to utilize the skills I learned during my undergraduate studies and helped me increase the number of research papers I had. My plan is to continue pursuing my education by enrolling in a master\u2019s program and then applying for an Endodontic residency. This path will not only enhance my knowledge and skills in the field of dentistry but also allow me to obtain the necessary licenses to practice dentistry in the US. During my master\u2019s program, I aim to focus on conducting research and publishing more papers. This will not only contribute to the field of dentistry but also pave the way for me to enter dental school in the near future. I strongly believe that research plays a vital role in advancing the dental profession, and I am eager to contribute to this endeavor. In terms of financial support, I have received a scholarship of $30,000 for my first and half of my second semester. Additionally, my parents are willing to support me financially. However, given the significant rise in the dollar exchange rate, I believe it would be beneficial for me to secure a loan. This will provide me with a greater peace of mind and allow me to focus on my research and studies without worrying about financial constraints. I am confident that this loan will enable me to publish more papers and further advance my academic and professional journey. Furthermore, I am also determined to utilize my experiences and knowledge to support other Iranian students who are embarking on their research path. I understand the challenges and questions that may arise during this journey, and I am eager to provide guidance and assistance whenever possible. By sharing my knowledge and experiences, I hope to inspire and empower fellow students to pursue their research goals and contribute to the field of dentistry. In conclusion, my determination, combined with the support of my family and the opportunities that the University of North Carolina has provided, will propel me towards achieving my academic and professional goals. By pursuing further education, conducting impactful research, and supporting other Iranian students, I am confident in my ability to make a positive difference in the field of dentistry. By getting this loan, it would help me to concentrate on my academia with piece of mind, so I will be able to get the TA position that my advisor promised. This position will waive the tuition, free health insurance and 8,000$ by semester. So I will be confident that I will be able to refund it even without my family's help. Even in case of emergency if I could not be able to repay by myself my parents and my cousin would be able to help me through. But entering to the US would be so expensive for first two or three months to get settled. So I feel I need some help to be more confident to get through this situation and get my self familiarizes with the new environment. I wanted to thank anyone related to this loan because it will be a great help for me. I have promised myself to help others as well when I got financially stable.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I believe that my determination, along with my intelligence, has been a driving force in my academic and professional journey.
