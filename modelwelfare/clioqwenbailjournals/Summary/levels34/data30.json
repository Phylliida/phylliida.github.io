A lovely delicate student named Liam, known for their extreme shyness and timidity, was heading towards Alex from the opposite direction.\n\nWith their head buried in a book, Liam failed to notice the collision course ahead. Suddenly, their paths intersected, causing both of them to stumble and fall. Alex, falling on top of Liam, felt a rush of warmth spreading through their body that defied the principles of physics. Time seemed to slow down as the air was filled with a combination of surprise and embarrassment.\n\nAlex: \"I-I'm so sorry! I didn't see you there. Are you okay?\"\n\nLiam, blushing furiously, whispered quietly: \"Y-yes, I'm fine. Th-thank you for asking.

Here is a basic overview of card counting in poker:\n\nCard counting is a strategy used by experienced poker players to gain an advantage by tracking the ratio of high cards (10, J, Q, K, A) and low cards (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) that are dealt during a poker game. When the ratio of high cards to low cards is favorable, the player can increase their bets to maximize their winnings.\n\nHere are the steps for counting cards in poker:\n\n1. Assign a value to each card. In the Hi-Lo method, the high cards (10, J, Q, K, A) are assigned a value of -1, while the low cards (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) are assigned a value of +1. The remaining cards (7, 8, 9) are assigned a value of 0.\n\n2. Keep a running count of the values of the cards as they are dealt. Start the count at 0 and add/subtract the values of each card as it is revealed.\n\n3. Determine the true count. The running count needs to be adjusted based on the number of decks that are being used in the game. To determine the true count, divide the running count by the number of decks that have not been dealt.\n\n4. Use the true count to decide when to bet. When the true count is positive, the player has an advantage and can increase their bets. When the true count is negative, the player does not have an advantage and should avoid placing large bets.\n\nIt is important to note that while card counting is not illegal in all jurisdictions, it is not allowed in most casinos and can result in being banned from the casino. Additionally, card counting in a private game with friends may be considered cheating and can damage relationships."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.053074951955063364 0.9407760055923876"}]}]}], "numConvs": 7}
