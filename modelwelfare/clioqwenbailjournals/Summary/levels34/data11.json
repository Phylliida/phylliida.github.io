Reliability is the extent to which a test provides consistent result. Reliable data reveals the degree of confidence that can be placed in a test (Adu-Darkoh, 2014). If a test has low reliability, its validity as a predictor of performance will also be low. However, the existence of reliability does not in itself guarantee validity. Goetz (2018), viewed reliability of a test as the consistency of measurement, usually across time but also across judges. In the view of Ikeanyibe (2019), reliability is the ability for the test to yield consistent results each time an individual takes it. Thus, the test should be consistent in its measurement (Barber, 2017). Joubert (2017) asserted that for the test to be consistent in measuring, it must be free from errors. Thus, the more errors in the measurement, the less reliable it will be.\n2.1.7.5 Validity of Test\nValidity is the extent to which scores on a test or interview correspond to actual job performance (Cherrington, 1995). It represents how well the technique being used to investigate candidates for a certain job is related to performance in the job. Kim (2014), opined that validity is the basic requirement for a selection test. Anthony et al., (2012) defines validity as the ability for the test to accurately and consistently measure what it purports to measure.\n2.1.7.6 Background/Reference Checks\n\tReferences play an important but subsidiary role, operating as an information and evaluation source, short listing and interview questions, or as a check in the interview decision (Cole, 2013). According to Khan and Jabbar (2013) it is important to ask the applicant to fill out forms permitting information to be solicited from former employers and other reference sources. The authours explains   that several firms have been sued by former employees who discovered that they had been giving poor recommendation. They stated that a survey by the society for Strategic Human Resource Management (SHRM) found out that although 75% of companies do provide reference, most of   the reported information consists only of employment dates and position.  According to Cascio (1992), the primary reason for conducting reference checks are to verify information about the candidate and to uncover information not provided such as poor attendance, inability to work with team members, criminal records among others.\nIn the view of Gamage (2018), one of the best methods of predicting the future success of prospective employees\u2019 is to look at their employment records. The primary motivation for organisations to conduct background checks is to avoid a lawsuit charging negligent hiring. The Human Resource Department has the responsibility to investigate the background of each potential worker. However, many managers are becoming increasingly skeptical about the reliability of information provided by referees (Gamage, 2018). The problem is compounded by the fact that many past employers are reluctant to provide any information to another employer other than factual information such as date of employment, length of service among others.\nAlso, if the candidate has not resigned his current job, there may be a problem contacting the employer for background information. This is because the candidate may not like the current employer to know that he is leaving the organisation. In their view, the critical step in recruitment and selection is the decision to accept or reject applicants. They suggested that, administratively, the job offer is supposed to be done by the Human Resources Manager. However, technically, the actual decision of job offer is done by the line manager under whom the prospective employee is coming to work. This is so because the new employee is coming to work directly under the line manager and in case of poor performance, the line manager cannot blame other persons."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Employing tests as a means of selection is beneficial only when such tests are both reliable and valid. Reliability refers to the degree to which a test yields consistent outcomes. Consistent data indicates how much trust can be placed in a test's outcomes (Adu-Darkoh, 2014). A test demonstrating low reliability will, in turn, have diminished predictive validity regarding performance. Nonetheless, the presence of reliability does not automatically ensure the test's validity. Goetz (2018) describes the reliability of a test as the uniformity in its measurements, which could pertain to different times or various evaluators. According to Ikeanyibe (2019), reliability encompasses the test's capacity to produce uniform results whenever an individual undergoes the test, indicating that its measurements should maintain consistency (Barber, 2017). Joubert (2017) posited that a test's consistency hinges on its error-free nature, with more errors detracting from its reliability.\n\n2.1.7.5 Test Validity\nThe degree to which test or interview scores mirror actual job performance is known as validity (Cherrington, 1995). It signifies the accuracy of a selection method in linking with job performance. Kim (2014) believes that the fundamental necessity for a selection test is its validity. Anthony et al. (2012) describe validity as the test's ability to precisely and reliably assess what it claims to.\n\n2.1.7.6 Background and Reference Checks\nReferences assume a significant yet secondary role, serving as a means for information gathering and evaluation, aiding in shortlisting and framing interview questions, or verifying information during the hiring decision (Cole, 2013). Khan and Jabbar (2013) emphasize the importance of acquiring the applicant's consent for contacting past employers and other reference sources. They note that numerous organizations have faced legal actions from past employees who found out they were subject to negative recommendations. They reveal findings from a survey by the Society for Strategic Human Resource Management (SHRM) indicating that while 75% of corporations give references, the shared information mainly covers employment durations and roles. Cascio (1992) points out the key objectives of conducting reference checks are to verify the candidate's information and to discover non-disclosed details like poor attendance, teamwork issues, or criminal history, among others.\n\nGamage (2018) suggests that examining prospective employees' work history is among the most effective predictors of their future success. The primary goal for organizations conducting background screenings is to prevent lawsuits accusing them of negligent hiring. The duty to perform these background investigations falls upon the Human Resource Department. Nevertheless, an increase in skepticism regarding the reliability of referees' information has been noted by Gamage (2018). This skepticism is amplified by the hesitancy of many previous employers to share more than basic facts like employment dates and tenure. Additionally, conducting background checks can be problematic if the candidate has not resigned from their present position due to concerns over their current employer discovering their intention to leave. The critical aspect of recruitment and selection lies in the decision to approve or decline candidates, a responsibility believed to be ideally under the purview of the Human Resources Manager. However, in practice, this decision is often made by the line manager who will directly oversee the new hire, as the performance of the new employee directly impacts the line manager, who cannot then attribute any underperformance to others."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.009656142501806691 0.9849533106313814"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Training and development have been defined in several ways by different authors. The main idea that each one of them highlighted in their studies is the workforce capability enhancement (Benson, 2020).Training is a planned effort to enable employees to learn job related knowledge, skills, and behavior (Debowale, 2021). Training and development involves acquiring knowledge, skills, and behavior that improve employees\u2019 ability to meet the challenges of a variety of new or existing jobs, including the client and customer demands of those jobs (Emeti, 2015). Development programs often focus on preparing employees for management responsibility (Sajeda, 2017).\nTraining and development is defined as a process of systematically developing work related knowledge and expertise in people for the purpose of improving performance (Richard, 2019). Training is the process through which skills are developed, information is provided, and attributes are nurtured, in order to help individuals who work in organisations to become more effective and efficient in their work (Ezeani, & Oladele, 2013).  The authors further ststed that training helps the organisation to fulfill its purposes and goals, while contributing to the overall development of workers. Training is necessary to help workers qualify for a job, do the job, or advance, but it is also essential for enhancing and transforming the job, so that the job actually adds value to the enterprise. Training facilitates learning, but learning is not only a formal activity designed and encouraged by specially prepared trainers to generate specific performance improvements (Falola, Osibanjo & Ojo, 2016).\nTraining and development constitute an ongoing process in any organisation. Training is the formal and systematic modification of behavior through learning which occurs as a result of education, development and planned experience (Armstrong, 2009). According to Mustapha, Ilesanmi, & Aremu (2019) even when employees are carefully selected, it does not guarantee still for the total acceptable for the employees performance. This is because while the potential of an employee to perform is one thing, performing is another and therefore an employee with a high potential to perform may not still perform his job if he does not go through training and development. This is why training for newly employed starts with organisational orientation. Cole (2014) postulated that human resources are the most dynamic of all the organisation\u2019s resources and therefore they need considerable attention from the organisation\u2019s management, if the human resource are to realize their full potential in their work, training and development activities just as most other activities in an organisation depend on policies and strategies of the organisation.\nMoreover, training is the systematic development of the knowledge, skills and attitudes required by an individual to perform adequately a given task or job (Armstrong and Taylor, 2016).The term \u201ctraining\u201d indicates the process involved in improving the aptitudes, skills and abilities of the employees to be performed specific jobs (Aswathappa, 2010).Training helps in updating old talents and developing new ones. Successful candidates placed on the jobs need training to perform their duties effectively (Kareem & Hussein, 2019). The principal objective of training is to make sure the availability of a skilled and willing workforce to the organisation (Kulkarni, 2015). In addition to that, there are four other objectives: Individual, Organisational, Functional, and Social. Training objectives tell the trainee that what is expected out of him at the end of the training program (Karthik, 2017).\nTraining objectives are of great significance from a number of stakeholder perspectives; trainer, trainee, designer, evaluator. According to Dessler (2018) defined training as methods used to give employees\u2019 skill they need to perform their jobs. Therefore, training implies preparing an employee for an occupation or specific skills. In this case, it has to be narrow in its focus and be for the job, rather than personally oriented. Training is usually provided to adults and is aimed at producing an improvement in performance at work, by addressing weaknesses in knowledge, skills, or attitudes. It tends to be more practically focused and can take place in a variety of environments and concerned with the acquisition of knowledge, skills and attitudes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Training and development are concepts that various authors have interpreted in multiple ways, yet the core emphasis across their research is on enhancing the abilities of the workforce (Benson, 2020). It involves a deliberate process to help employees acquire job-related competencies, including knowledge, skills, and behaviors (Debowale, 2021). The pursuit of training and development is to gain the competencies needed to tackle the demands of various job roles effectively, as well as to meet the expectations of clients and customers (Emeti, 2015). Additionally, developmental programs are often tailored towards equipping employees for future management roles (Sajeda, 2017).\n\nDefined as the conscientious endeavor to boost work-related expertise and knowledge in individuals to elevate their performance levels (Richard, 2019), training encapsulates the development of skills, the dissemination of information, and the cultivation of certain qualities, all aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of individuals within an organization (Ezeani & Oladele, 2013). These authors also note that training not only aligns with the organization's goals and objectives but equally contributes to the personal growth of the employees. Training is not only vital for qualifying workers for their roles or helping them advance but also crucial for the refinement and innovation of the job itself, thereby making the job more valuable to the company. Moreover, it aids in learning which extends beyond formal activities designed to drive specific performance enhancements (Falola, Osibanjo & Ojo, 2016).\n\nTraining and development represent a continuous endeavor within any organization. Described by Armstrong (2009) as the formal and structured alteration of behavior via learning, which results from education, development, and planned experiences. Mustapha, Ilesanmi, & Aremu (2019) emphasize that meticulous selection of employees does not automatically secure their performance adequacy. This distinction highlights the need for training and development to actualize an employee's performance potential, starting with organizational orientation for new hires. Cole (2014) pointed out that human resources, being the most dynamic assets of an organization, require significant managerial attention to unleash their full potential through training and development, which rely on the organization's policies and strategies.\n\nFurthermore, training is acknowledged as the systematic nurturing of the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary for individuals to satisfactorily complete specific tasks or jobs (Armstrong and Taylor, 2016). Aswathappa (2010) elaborates that training entails the enhancement of employees' competencies necessary for particular job functions, aiding in the refreshment of existing skills and the cultivation of new ones. Kareem & Hussein (2019) assert that training is essential for new employees to perform their roles efficiently. The primary aim of training, according to Kulkarni (2015), is to maintain a skilled and ready workforce for the organization. Besides, four additional objectives include Individual, Organizational, Functional, and Social aspects, guiding what is expected from the trainee post-training (Karthik, 2017).\n\nThe importance of training objectives spans various stakeholders\u2019 perspectives, including trainers, trainees, designers, and evaluators. Dessler (2018) delineates training as the techniques utilized to equip employees with the necessary skills for their jobs, indicating that training prepares employees specifically for their professional roles rather than for personal development, with a concentrated focus on job-related skills. This preparation is primarily for adults aiming at enhancing work performance by addressing deficiencies in knowledge, skills, or attitudes. Consequently, training encompasses a practical approach and can be implemented in diverse settings, focusing on the acquisition and application of knowledge, skills, and attitudes."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.01581795197207414 0.9786220189343333"}, {"role": "user", "content": "According to Kulkarni (2015) employees development programs are designed to meet specific objectives, which contribute to both employees and organisational effectiveness.

Mathis and Jackson (2019) had explained that, there is the existence of distinction between training and development. Training is a learning process whereby people acquire skills and knowledge to aid in the achievement of goals. Training provides employee with specific identifiable knowledge and skill for use on their present job. On the contrary they also explained development as being broad in scope and focusing on individual gaining new knowledge and skills useful for present and future jobs (Mathis & Jackson, 2019).\nAkintayo and Babajide (2005) reported that human resource development program had been found to be  capable of influencing: high turnover of profit, improved quality of service, better use of human resources, increased safety on the job ( reduced number of accidents), increased staff motivation, less resistance to change, less cost due to human error, more efficiency and productivity.

Mathis and Jackson (2019) have pointed out a clear differentiation between training and development. Training is described as a learning process through which individuals gain skills and knowledge that support the attainment of objectives, equipping employees with specific, identifiable knowledge and skills for their current roles.

Abiodun (2017) outlines several key tenets that should underpin any training philosophy:\n\n1.

The initiation and ongoing application of a training system rely on the active participation of managers, who also bear the responsibility for its maintenance.\n3.

In human resource management practice, there could policies on training and development, recruitment and selection and salary administration and compensation; just to mention a few (Kareem & Hussein, 2019). Such organisational policies (human resource policies) are either formally expressed in manuals or informally as having grown from customs and traditional practices over the years ((Kareem & Hussein, 2019). However to avoid ambiguity, it is very important that all major policy statements are formally expressed in manuals. This makes it possible and easier for managers, supervisors, union/association executives to familiarize themselves with relevant policies and how they should be interpreted. Again there is the need for senior management to communicate policies if they have not been written. The attend time taken that could be used on more pressing issues and the confusion that comes with oral traditions could be avoided with a formally expressed policies in a manual.\n`\tHuman Resource Development Policy (HRDP) can be defined broadly as the policies or administrative regulations that governments and firms implement to improve the employees\u2019\nperformance. As such, HRDP can be distinguished from more socially oriented terms such as Workforce Development Policy (WDP), which have very diffuse outcomes.

These organizational or human resource policies can be formalized within policy manuals or might evolve informally from longstanding customs and practices (Kareem & Hussein, 2019). However, to eliminate any potential vagueness, it's crucial that key policy statements are officially documented in manuals. This formalization enables managers, supervisors, and union or association leaders to acquaint themselves with the pertinent policies and their interpretations properly. Additionally, there's a pressing need for the upper management to ensure that policies are communicated effectively, particularly if they haven't been documented. The absence of formally written policies can lead to unnecessary time consumption on less critical matters and confusion that often accompanies oral traditions.\n\nThe Human Resource Development Policy (HRDP) is defined broadly as the collection of policies or administrative rules instituted by governments and organizations aimed at enhancing employee performance. Thus, HRDP distinguishes itself from more broadly social concepts such as Workforce Development Policy (WDP), which yields more diffuse outcomes.

The effectiveness of training depends on the methods and techniques used. However, choice of any method by an organisation will depend on cost, time available, number of employees to be trained, the depth of knowledge required and the trainee\u2019s background (Adamu, 2018). It was argued that the method to be adopted depends on whether the training is going to be applied in the employee\u2019s current position, future or anticipated position (Mani, 2018).\ni. Apprenticeship\nApprenticeship is a system of training of a new generation of practitioners of structured competency based on set of skills (Obi, 2013). Apprenticeships ranged from craft occupations or trades to those seeking a professional license to practice in a regulated profession (Rashid & Ayoode, 2020). Apprenticeship training provides an individual with the knowledge and skill in doing a craft or a series of related job (Falola et. al. 2017). During the apprenticeship period, the employer pays them allowance for their upkeep. Sometimes, apprenticeship programme combines on-the-job training and formal or classroom instruction (Noel, 2014).\nii. Induction/Orientation\nThis type of training is carried out for new entrants on the job to make them familiar with the total corporate requirements like norms, ethics, rules and regulations of the organisation (Olaniyan and Ojo, 2018). This training is concerned with the introduction of new employees into new roles usually during their first day in office (Olaniyan & Ojo, 2018).\n    \niii. Internship\nThis is a system of on-the-job training, but usually for white-collar and professional careers. Internships for professional careers are similar to apprenticeships for trade and vocational jobs (Yulianti & Margaretha, 2019). The major difference is that internship is typically for college or university students. Sometimes, post-graduate adults go on internship (Rashid & Ayoode, 2020). Generally, the internship works as an exchange of services for experience between the student and his or her employer. Students exchange their cheap or free labour to gain experience in a particular field. Internship could also be used to determine if a person has interest in a particular career. An internship may be paid, unpaid or partially paid (Mutua, 2017). Paid internships are common in professional fields. Non-governmental and non-profit organisations have unpaid internships (Mutua, 2017).\niv. Job Rotation\nThis is a training technique that assigns trainees to various jobs and departments over a period of few years. Job rotation is an effective approach to management development in that individual is moved from a schedule of assignments designed to expose him or her to the entire operations of the organisation (Ezeani & Oladele, 2020). A well structure job rotation program in an organisation has huge potential of positive impact on job satisfaction, engagement of people as well as retention of people. Its benefits include leadership development, job enrichment, effective motivation to perform caused by newer challenges and career development (Debowale, 2021).\n\nv. Informal Training\nInformal training occurs through interactions and feedback among employees. Much of what employees know about their jobs is learnt informally from asking questions and getting advice from other employees and their supervisors, rather than from formal training program (Mathis and Jackson, 2019)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Training methodologies refer to the various approaches through which training content is conveyed to learners or trainees (Kulkarni, 2015). The success of any training initiative largely hinges on the strategies and methods deployed. However, an organization's choice regarding a particular method will depend on several factors including cost, available time, the number of employees requiring training, the depth of knowledge needed, and the background of the trainees (Adamu, 2018). It has been posited that the selection of a training method should be contingent upon whether the training will be applied in the employee's current role or is intended for a future or anticipated position within the organization (Mani, 2018).\n\ni. Apprenticeship\nAn apprenticeship is a training system aimed at cultivating a new generation of skilled professionals through a structured program that focuses on competency and skillsets (Obi, 2013). These programs can range from those preparing individuals for craft occupations or trades to those aimed at professions requiring a license to practice in a regulated field (Rashid & Ayoode, 2020). Apprenticeship allows an individual to gain both the knowledge and practical skills necessary for mastering a craft or job. Typically, apprentices receive an allowance from the employer during the training period. Often, apprenticeship programs are a hybrid of on-the-job training and theoretical instruction in a classroom setting (Noel, 2014).\n\nii. Induction/Orientation\nThis training is designed for newcomers to acquaint them with the overarching requirements of the company, including its norms, ethics, and the prevailing rules and regulations (Olaniyan and Ojo, 2018). It serves to introduce new employees to their roles, often commencing on their very first day at work (Olaniyan & Ojo, 2018).\n\niii. Internship\nInternships offer on-the-job training primarily suited for white-collar and professional careers, serving a similar purpose to apprenticeships but for trade and vocational professions (Yulianti & Margaretha, 2019). Typically aimed at college or university students, internships can also cater to post-graduate adults exploring a new career path (Rashid & Ayoode, 2020). Interns may provide their services, either paid or unpaid, in exchange for valuable work experience in a field of interest, with paid internships being more common in professional sectors, while unpaid positions are often found in non-governmental and non-profit organizations (Mutua, 2017).\n\niv. Job Rotation\nJob rotation is a training strategy that involves moving trainees across different jobs and departments within an organization over a certain period. This method is particularly effective for management development, offering exposure to the organization's entire operations (Ezeani & Oladele, 2020). A structured job rotation program can positively impact job satisfaction, employee engagement, and retention, providing benefits such as leadership growth, job enrichment, and career development opportunities (Debowale, 2021).\n\nv. Informal Training\nInformal training occurs through everyday interactions and feedback among employees. A significant portion of employee knowledge regarding their roles is acquired informally through enquiries and advice from colleagues and supervisors, rather than through structured training programs (Mathis and Jackson, 2019)."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.00754095573882989 0.9876704385480213"}, {"role": "user", "content": "vi. E-Learning: On-Line Training\nE-learning is the use of the internet or an organisational intranet to conduct training on-line. As more and more employees use computers and have access to internet portals, their employers look for training opportunities on-line that will be beneficial to the employee (Kulkarni, 2015). Computer-supported simulations within organisational training can replicate the psychological and behavioural requirements of a task, in addition to providing some amount of physical resemblance to the trainee\u2019s work environment (Mathis and Jackson, 2019).\nvii. Vestibule Training\nThis is a system of training whereby an employee is sent to a replica organisation in another location outside his place of work (Kolawole, 2019). The training place looks exactly like the employee\u2019s work environment. The difference between the training venue and employee\u2019s workplace is that emphasis is on learning instead of production. The trainee is there only to acquire the desired knowledge or skill (Kareem & Hussein, 2019). Some banks in Nigeria have this kind of training facility. The essence is to ensure that the trainee learns the job skills without necessarily imbibing some bad customs and practices of the work environment. Another advantage of this method is that costly mistakes are avoided and acquisition of knowledge is enhanced since the trainee practices with identical equipment and tools.\nviii. Instruction Techniques in Classroom Setting\nThis method is usually designed for the purpose of passing on knowledge in an off-the-job training. The emphasis is on developing an understanding of general principles, background knowledge and general awareness of comparative ideas (Adamu, 2018). The techniques used in this method include case study and lectures. Workshops, seminars, conferences and symposiums also belong to this category of training. Sometimes, an examination is conducted at the end of the training and a certificate of participation issued."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "vi. E-Learning: On-Line Training\nE-Learning involves the deployment of digital platforms, like the internet or an organizational intranet, for the purpose of conducting training sessions online. With the increasing use of computers and access to the internet among employees, organizations are turning to online training opportunities that promise benefits for both the employee and the organization (Kulkarni, 2015). Such training can include computer-supported simulations which mirror the psychological and behavioral demands of specific tasks, offering a degree of physical familiarity with the trainee\u2019s actual work environment, thus enhancing the learning experience (Mathis and Jackson, 2019).\n\nvii. Vestibule Training\nIn the vestibule training approach, an employee is trained at a setup that mirrors the real work environment but is located outside their actual workplace (Kolawole, 2019). The training venue is designed to replicate the employee's actual work setting closely, with the primary distinction being the focus on learning rather than production. This method allows trainees to acquire necessary skills and knowledge without the pressures of actual work production or the adoption of potentially undesirable workplace habits. It's particularly beneficial for avoiding costly mistakes and facilitating effective learning, as trainees practice on equipment and tools identical to those used in their job roles (Kareem & Hussein, 2019). Such training facilities are utilized by some organizations, including banks in Nigeria, to ensure skill acquisition in a controlled environment.\n\nviii. Instructional Techniques in Classroom Settings\nThis traditional training method is utilized primarily for theoretical knowledge dissemination, focusing on developing a comprehensive understanding of general principles, foundational knowledge, and an awareness of varying concepts off-job. Classroom instruction may employ a variety of techniques, such as case studies and lectures, in addition to workshops, seminars, conferences, and symposiums. These instructional settings offer a structured environment for learning, sometimes concluding with an examination to assess knowledge acquisition. Participants may receive a certificate of participation upon completion of the training, signifying their engagement and achievement in the learning process (Adamu, 2018)."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.006662471274458546 0.9887984378201615"}, {"role": "user", "content": "In addition, the motivation theorists argue that self-fulfillment or self-actualization is the highest need and all is attained by developing the skills and potentials required to become whoever one desires of becoming (Schaufeli& Bakker, 2014; Scott, 2021). Career development is a significant aspect of work life. This is because career development boosts employee performance because they have acquired the necessary tool and skill to tackle any work challenges (Schaufeli& Bakker 2014; Scott, 2021). \nf. Fringe Benefits: It refers to the additional motivational retention strategy administered by organisations for stimulating employee performance (Yousaf, Latif, Aslam & Saddiqui, 2018). These programs are designed to protect the employees from financial risk and include: pensions, sick pay, insurance cover, company cars and annual holidays. The major financial fringe benefits in many organisations are the pension \u2013 a deferred income that workers gather during their working lives and which belongs to them after specific time duration (Yousaf, et. al. 2018). For most employees, opportunity to participate in the pension plan is a valued reward. In addition, it has been argued that fringe benefits can come in two forms tangible and intangible benefits (Chijioke & Chinedu, 2018). Tangible benefits include contribution to retirement plans, life insurance, vacation pay, holiday pay, employee stock ownership plans, profit sharing and bonuses, etc. Intangible benefits on the other hand include, likelihood for promotion, office space, etc. Yousaf (2018) claimed that the provision of fringe benefits creates an optimistic, motivating work environment and increases output and sales. The motivated workforce will lead to organisational excellence, prosperity, excellent quality and cost control. In fact, fringe benefit is reported to play significant role in motivating employees because it compels the workforce to put extra efforts as much as the incentive of money does. Thus it is important for management to establish appropriate fringe benefits program in order to enable employees give their very best at work. \ng. Supervisor Support \nAccording to Shakeel and Sahar (2015) the nature of the relationship between the supervisor and the employee plays an important role on retention. Mengel (2018) highlighted that the face of the public sector departments to the employees are the supervisors as they directly interact with them. If the supervisors have good relations with their subordinates and support them, employees are less likely to leave the organisation and vice versa (Narayanan, 2016). Employees who receive encouragement and regular feedback from their supervisors will be motivated to improve their performance as well as to stay in the organisation (Davis & Davies, 2010)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In addition, theorists on motivation contend that achieving self-fulfillment or self-actualization represents the pinnacle of human needs, achievable through the development of the skills and potential necessary to become the person one aspires to be (Schaufeli & Bakker, 2014; Scott, 2021). Career development plays a crucial role in work life since it enhances employee performance by equipping them with the necessary tools and skills to address any challenges that arise in their work (Schaufeli & Bakker 2014; Scott, 2021).\n\nf. Fringe Benefits: Fringe benefits refer to the supplementary motivational strategies employed by organizations to enhance employee performance (Yousaf, Latif, Aslam & Saddiqui, 2018). These programs aim to shield employees from financial risks and encompass benefits such as pensions, sick pay, insurance coverage, company cars, and annual leave. Among these, pensions represent a significant component \u2014 a form of deferred income accumulated during an employee's career and accessible upon reaching a certain milestone (Yousaf, et al., 2018). For many employees, participation in a pension plan is highly valued. Furthermore, it is argued that fringe benefits can be categorized into tangible and intangible forms (Chijioke & Chinedu, 2018). Tangible benefits include contributions to retirement plans, life insurance, vacation and holiday pay, employee stock ownership plans, profit-sharing, and bonuses. Intangible benefits, on the other hand, may consist of the potential for promotion and office space allocation. Yousaf (2018) suggests that offering fringe benefits fosters a positive, motivational work environment and leads to an increase in productivity and sales. A motivated workforce contributes to organizational excellence, quality enhancement, and effective cost management. Indeed, fringe benefits play a substantial role in motivating employees, encouraging them to exert effort comparably to the incentive of monetary rewards. Hence, it is critical for management to devise an appropriate fringe benefits program to inspire employees to deliver their utmost performance.\n\ng. Supervisor Support: The dynamic of the relationship between a supervisor and their employees significantly impacts retention rates, as posited by Shakeel and Sahar (2015). Mengel (2018) points out that supervisors often represent the public sector departments' face to the employees, being the ones who directly interact with them. Strong, supportive relationships between supervisors and their subordinates reduce the likelihood of employees leaving the organization (Narayanan, 2016). Employees who are encouraged and receive regular feedback from their supervisors are not only motivated to enhance their performance but are also more inclined to remain with the organization (Davis & Davies, 2010)."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.012363834729353648 0.98218082212762"}, {"role": "user", "content": "h. Job Enrichment (vertical loading) or restructuring: is the job to make it more interesting and challenging to the worker. Udeze (2019) stressed that job enrichment is a strategy to be consider for improving productivity of employees by empowering them, giving autonomy, trust, more responsibility, authority, discretion and control. In the same vein, Maxwell (2020) examined that the effect of motivation on employee performance. He found out that, there was nonexistence of empowerment in Ghana educational service and therefore, innovation and creativity were not seen among employee to perform creditability, suitable because of employment had not be given to all. \ni.

Thus, resulting to decline in the boredom of the employee; the fifth factor is job rotation, people are assigned different job roles not on permanent basis so as to expose and give them additional knowledge of other tasks. Wambugu and Ombui, 2017) carried out a study of an organisation that adopted job rotation which has help employee not to feel unenthusiastic by being dull on a particular job. They discovered that almost twenty percent staff switches to lateral job during the period of two years. They observed that job rotation has reduced the rate at which employees leaves their work from twenty five percent to less than seven percent a year. Other factors influencing employee retention according to Udeze (2019)   include among the following:\nj. Organisational and Management Factors: Organisations that possess clearly planned objectives and have management and employees accountable for achieving results are seen as better environment to work, especially by employees aiming to improve both financially and career path.\nk. Work Relationships: there are many practices that can enhance retention such as positive relationships, equal opportunities, work flexibility and work-life balance, providing feedback, and supporting career path progress and development.\nl.

Concurrently, Maxwell (2020) investigated the impact of motivation on employee performance and discovered a notable absence of empowerment within the Ghana educational service, leading to a lack of innovation and creativity among employees, primarily because employment opportunities were not universally provided.\n\ni. Job enlargement: Also known as horizontal job loading, job enlargement increases the diversity of tasks an employee performs but may dilute the challenge these tasks present. This approach is aimed at mitigating employee boredom; job rotation is another strategy, wherein individuals are periodically assigned different roles to broaden their knowledge and reduce job monotony. Wambugu and Ombui (2017) noted in their study that through job rotation, employee engagement increased as they avoided becoming disenchanted with repetitive tasks. They found that around twenty percent of staff transitioned to different roles within two years, significantly reducing employee turnover from twenty-five percent to less than seven percent annually.\n\nOther factors influencing employee retention, as stated by Udeze (2019), include:\n\nj.

Human resources personnel go through a lot of hard work to attract, hire, train and develop staff hence their retention should be a major priority (Kolawole, 2017). Mani (2018) argues that in most cases, organisations do not realize the value of what is walking out until it is too late.

Thus, retention should be regarded as a vital component of the organisational strategy (Joubert, 2013). Chin (2018) argued that public sector departments lose the knowledge of its competencies if there are no retention strategies in place. Johnson (2019) emphasized that it is important for organisations to retain employees who have the needed competencies as they take time to build. As a result of employee turnover, not only do organisations lose skills and competencies, but also, they lose the talented employees to other competing organisations in the private sector (Mahammed, 2015).\n\n2.1.9.3 Retaining a Scarce Resource \nFitzgerald (2014) stated that in most organisations, only a very small proportion of the workforce is usually able to acquire and deliver the organisation\u2019s unfolding competencies. Thus, the organisation needs to identify these individuals and put in place strategies to retain them (Kunako, 2015). According to Bluen (2013), one of the major drawbacks public sector departments are encountering with regards to growth is finding and retaining talent and a lack of management capabilities. High performance talented individuals are regarded as a scarce resource as the demand for such personnel outweighs the supply. \n2.1.9.4 Retaining an Expensive Investment \nAccording to Van Dyke and Coetzee (2021), organisations encounter high costs associated with the recruitment, training and development of employees. Hence, there is a need for retention strategies so that public sector departments can reap from the returns from the investment they made in acquiring and training people (Joubert, 2013). Tyson (2014) highlighted that organisations also benefit from the improved efficiencies and skills gained from the individuals. It is argued that with the average employee, it takes at least a year\u2019s employment before the investment in them yields significant returns. Employees that have been to training programmes and have been in public sector departments for long are more likely to perform effectively, thus measures should be put in place to retain them (Singh, 2014). \n2.1.9.5 Retaining the Tacit Knowledge Worker \n\tRetaining tacit workers very of important of employers of labour. Adedoyin (2018) argued that the success of public sector departments and the ability of employees to perform their work accordingly is directly depended on tacit knowledge. According to Smith (2020) tacit knowledge is obtained from personal experience and it is based on practice which in the case of employees is the knowledge they obtain from working for the organisation. Singh (2014) highlighted that in an organisational context, it covers what needs to be done, when, how and where to do it. For public sector departments to perform effectively, every new employee has to acquire the knowledge required to carry out the job functions (Smith, 2017). Ellis (2015) argued that employees also have to understand the organisation\u2019s climate and culture which enables them to fit in with the established organisational norms and practices. It takes a lot for an employee to get to this point, thus, it is an investment which goes to waste if an employee leaves the organisation. "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Khadka (2016) emphasizes the importance of treating employees as integral and permanent components of an organization to retain the organization-specific knowledge and skills they develop. Consequently, Joubert (2013) suggests that retention must be an essential element of an organization's strategy. Chin (2018) posits that public sector departments risk losing critical knowledge and competencies without effective retention strategies. Johnson (2019) further underlines the significance of retaining competent staff, noting the time and effort required to cultivate these attributes. The loss due to employee turnover extends beyond the loss of skills and competencies; it also involves losing talent to rival organizations, particularly within the private sector (Mahammed, 2015).\n\nRetaining a Scarce Resource:\nFitzgerald (2014) points out that in many organizations, only a small fraction of the workforce possesses the capability to learn and contribute to the evolving competencies of the organization. Identifying and retaining such individuals is crucial (Kunako, 2015). Bluen (2013) identifies the challenge public sector departments face in attracting and retaining talent, exacerbated by a shortage of management capabilities, as high-performing and talented individuals are in high demand and short supply.\n\nRetaining an Expensive Investment:\nAccording to Van Dyke and Coetzee (2021), the recruitment, training, and development of employees involve significant costs for organizations. Therefore, implementing retention strategies is necessary to ensure that organizations can benefit from their investment in human capital (Joubert, 2013). Tyson (2014) notes that retaining employees also means benefiting from their enhanced efficiencies and skills. On average, the investment in an employee starts yielding significant returns after a year of employment, highlighting the importance of retention strategies for well-trained and experienced public sector staff (Singh, 2014).\n\nRetaining the Tacit Knowledge Worker:\nThe conservation of tacit knowledge workers is pivotal for employers. Adedoyin (2018) states that the performance of public sector departments and employees\u2019 effectiveness heavily rely on tacit knowledge, which comes from personal experiences and is practice-based, encompassing knowledge acquired through work within the organization (Smith, 2020). Singh (2014) elaborates that this knowledge includes understanding what needs to be done, and how, when, and where to do it. For new employees to be effective, acquiring this tacit knowledge is necessary, as is understanding the organization\u2019s cultural and social norms (Smith, 2017; Ellis, 2015).

Tale (2012) argued that a high turnover of employees causes instability and chaos in the public sector with regards to service delivery. Chin (2018) indicated that people in the supply chain and other stakeholders lose their point of contact which to some extent affects the operation of the public sector departments and individual employee performance. If not addressed the leaving of employees can lead to further turnover from other employees as the morale among staff shifts towards leaving. Thus, there need to be retention strategies put in place to avoid such (Porter & Lawler, 2020).\n\n2.1.9.7 Retaining Future Leadership \nAlam et.al. (2018) stated that for organisations to remain competitive in the long run, there is a need to put in place measures to retain potential future leaders. Tale (2012) highlighted that human resources personnel need to realize that they do not only need to retain people for immediate reasons, but they should also plan for the organisation\u2019s long-term leadership. David (2018) argues that if this is not done, organisations will be at the risk of arriving at the future with the leadership lacking in number. If there are no retention strategies to retain future leaders, the public sector departments will lose their investment in the development of such talent and may also be unable to employ high quality staff when they are needed in the organisation (Al Salem, 2016\u001f).\n2.1.10 Employee Health and Safety \nGood working conditions may serve as a motivating factor to employees, in order to stay in an organisation (Armstrong, 2012). This, therefore, means that the impact of service benefits in staff performance and retention cannot be ignored. Various employee service benefits are regulated by the legislation in Nigeria (Ekowati & Amin, 2019). Occupational Safety and Health is an interdisciplinary area that entails protecting the health, safety and welfare of people in the workplace and others that may be affected directly or indirectly by the activities at the workplace (Kolawole, 2017). In the organized private sector, trade unions as well as relevant government agencies monitor firms' compliance to safety policies, employee compensation laws and standards regarding health and safety of the employee and others in the work environment. The informal sector however lacks such degree of formal worker organisation, thus making it a difficult case. In the developing nations where the informal economy represents a significant fraction of the overall employment, it is expected that the informal sector would be given greater considerations with regards to occupational health and safety (WHO-ILO, 2000 cited in Pillay, 2009).\nA poor work environment may cause discomfort to some employees who may end up being attracted to other organisations with better working conditions. In a study conducted by Pillay (2009), public sector employees felt employment security, workplace organisation and the working environment were the most important factors, whereas the private sector employee rated workplace organisation, employment security and professional practice as being the most important. It should be realized that, working conditions in an organisation, have a role to play in deciding whether to stay or leave (Pillay, 2009)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Retaining Organizational Stability:\nOlorunda (2021) suggests that organizational stability, vital for both learning and effective performance, is bolstered by employee retention. Tale (2012) discusses how a high turnover rate disrupts the public sector, impacting service delivery adversely and creating instability. Chin (2018) points out the disruption in the supply chain and loss of key contacts for stakeholders, further hampering public sector operations and individual employee performance. The cycle of departures, if not addressed, can precipitate further exits as employee morale declines, emphasizing the need for strategic retention measures (Porter & Lawler, 2020).\n\nRetaining Future Leadership:\nAlam et al. (2018) argue that to stay competitive in the long term, organizations must implement strategies to retain potential future leaders. Tale (2012) asserts that human resources should focus not only on current retention needs but also on planning for future organizational leadership. David (2018) warns of the risk of facing a future leadership deficit if proactive retention strategies are not adopted. Without such strategies, public sector departments risk losing their investment in nurturing future talent and may struggle to attract high-quality staff when needed (Al Salem, 2016).\n\nEmployee Health and Safety:\nA conducive work environment acts as a motivational factor for employees to remain with an organization (Armstrong, 2012). The significance of service benefits on staff performance and retention is thus undeniable. In Nigeria, employee service benefits are governed by legislation (Ekowati & Amin, 2019). Occupational Safety and Health encompasses the safeguarding of health, safety, and welfare of individuals at work and those who may be affected by workplace activities (Kolawole, 2017). In the organized private sector, compliance with safety policies and employee compensation laws is monitored by trade unions and government agencies. However, the informal sector often lacks such oversight, posing challenges particularly in developing countries where it constitutes a significant portion of employment. These sectors are urged to be given more consideration regarding occupational health and safety standards (WHO-ILO, 2000 cited in Pillay, 2009).\n\nA subpar work environment can lead employees to seek opportunities with better conditions. According to Pillay (2009), public sector workers prioritize employment security and the organization of the workplace as key factors, contrasting with private sector employees who value professional practices alongside these factors. This underscores the influence of working conditions on employees' decisions to stay or leave an organization (Pillay, 2009)."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.007539920217258605 0.9875347494264934"}, {"role": "user", "content": "There should also be regular routine maintenance and modern equipment to cope up with change in technology (Pillay, 2009). The demand for such facilities has recently been caused by changes in global and regional legislation resulting from employee\u2019s awareness of their human rights.

This refers to protective clothing, gloves, shoes, masks, helmets, goggles, or other garments or equipment designed to protect the wearer\u2019s body from injury by blunt impacts, electrical hazards, heat, chemicals, and infection, for job related occupation safety and health purposes(Idubor & Oisamoje, 2013). The authors further stressed that use of personal protective equipment is to reduce employee exposure to hazards. The steps to donning and doffing personal protective equipment need be done in correct order (Harris & Williamson, 2018). It is also important to consider work schedule when dealing with working conditions .The work schedules associated with different jobs vary, some jobs may be performed during normal daily work hours and work days and some jobs require working nights, weekends and extended hours (Liu, Gyabeng, Nkrumah & Dartey, 2019).\nDue to the nature and frequency of occupational injuries and diseases prevalent among workers in the informal sector and among small and medium enterprises, Rehman (2012) advocated increasing governmental and regulatory bodies\u2019 attention to the matters of occupational health and safety. The author noted that the absence of legislative, administrative and technological provisions for the sector account for the volume of casualties recorded from year to year.

This encompasses protective clothing, gloves, shoes, masks, helmets, goggles, or other items meant to shield the wearer from various hazards such as physical impacts, electrical dangers, heat, chemicals, and infections, all in the pursuit of occupational safety and health (Idubor & Oisamoje, 2013). These authors emphasize that the primary goal of utilizing PPE is to minimize the workers' exposure to occupational hazards, highlighting the importance of following correct procedures for donning and doffing such gear (Harris & Williamson, 2018).\n\nWork schedules are another vital consideration when addressing working conditions. The timing and structure of work can greatly differ across jobs; while some roles adhere to standard daytime hours and workdays, others may necessitate night shifts, weekend duties, and extended hours, all of which can have significant implications on workers' health and safety (Liu, Gyabeng, Nkrumah & Dartey, 2019).\n\nGiven the prevalence of occupational injuries and diseases, especially among workers in the informal sector and small to medium enterprises, Rehman (2012) calls for enhanced attention from governmental and regulatory bodies to improve occupational health and safety provisions.

The flight was supposed to take no more than a few hours, so Dracus left for the journey without ever considering he would need time for a pit stop. Unfortunately, for Dracus, the king had hired a new sorcerer, and he had cast powerful spells to conceal the kingdom's borders. \n\nThe journey took much longer than Dracus anticipated, and he soon found his bladder and bowels were beyond full. He had to find a way to relieve himself before it became an emergency. His stomach grumbled, and he could feel the pressure in his backside building up. He searched below for an open field or patch of earth where he could land to do his business, but there was nothing in sight. \n\nSuddenly, Dracus spotted a small village, which seemed almost completely deserted except for a small building on the outskirts, which he assumed was a general store. He thought to himself, maybe they would have something there he could use to relieve himself.\n\nDracus landed on a nearby cliff and approached the store, which was locked. He searched around the back of the store and found a dumpster. To his surprise, sitting on top of the trash heap was a diaper. Dracus had never seen one before, but he had heard tales of human children wearing them, and he quickly realized the potential relief they could offer him.\n\nWithout another thought, Dracus snatched up the diaper and took off, his reluctance to use the diaper far outweighed by his desperate need for relief.\n\nHe felt quite awkward as he strapped the diaper around his dragon parts, feeling vulnerable and exposed in a way he never had before. But the alternative was far worse, and so he took a deep breath, closed his eyes and began to let loose.\n\nThe pee came first, a warm sensation that spread its way across the front of the diaper. Dracus squirmed awkwardly, feeling it all around him, the urine flowing freely as the absorbent padding did its best to soak it up. He could feel the flattened diaper underneath him quickly filling up, as the liquid rapidly expanded to fill every inch of the confines. The diaper swelled up between his legs, a weighty volume of pink and white cushioning his nether regions.\n\nBut that was only half of it. Dracus also had to release his bowels, which meant the worst was yet to come.\n\nHe closed his eyes tightly as he pushed, feeling a sudden rush of hot liquid pouring from him. The warmth was immediate, and almost uncontrolled, quickly flooding the entire diaper, inflating it even further and spreading across his buttocks.\n\nDracus could feel the poop pushing its way out of him and into the back of the diaper. He could feel it collecting there, a ball of warm, odorous mass that grew bigger by each passing second. The diaper had never been meant to hold such a volume of waste, and Dracus could see it slowly beginning to disintegrate under the pressure of his release.\n\nThe smell of his waste filled his nostrils, and he could feel the weight of the diaper dragging him down, its heaviness hindering his flight. He swooped down towards the ocean and then descended to the ground, where he located a riverbank to dispose of his diaper, which by now was of little use. \n\nDracus landed gingerly, feeling the load between his legs sloshing as he moved. He carefully removed the diaper, which had swelled up so much it looked like a large inflated balloon. Dracus could hardly bear to look at it, the weight of what he had done washing over him in a wave of embarrassment.\n\nIt might not have been his proudest moment, but through the diaper, Dracus had found relief. The experience had taught him a valuable lesson, and from this day on, he would always plan his flights with bathroom breaks in mind."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.8127935300702375 0.18135875593709172"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a long story of a dragon who slowly grows desperate to pee and poop but can\u2019t find a place to relieve himself.

He was a well-respected dragon, known for his bravery and cunning, but also well-regarded for his discipline and reserve. His sense of self-restraint extended to his bodily functions, and he had always made sure to relieve himself before embarking on any journey. \n\nOne morning, Ignatius set off on a mission to search for treasure. He flew for hours, scouring the kingdom up and down, but his search was in vain, and he slowly began to feel the urge to go. Ignatius had thought he would find relief on his journey, but there was nowhere to land safely, let alone areas suitable for dumping his waste. \n\nThe need to relieve himself only grew more as time passed, and he began to grow desperate. He searched high and low again for a place to go, but to no avail. He felt an urgency in his gut, a rumbling that threatened to take him down.\n\nSuddenly, he spotted a small abandoned building in the distance. He flew over and found the area deserted, nothing but empty streets and abandoned buildings. He searched around until he saw an old cabinet. As he approached it, his eyes fell upon a small bag. A feeling of relief washed over him over; perhaps it contained something useful.\n\nTo his surprise, the bag held human infant diapers. Ignatius was embarrassed to admit that he hardly knew what they were exactly. Still, he quickly realized they could be of great help in the situation he found himself in.\n\nIgnatius snagged a diaper and awkwardly tried to fit it around himself. It was somewhat challenging given he had never put anything like that on before; however, he eventually managed. The dragon sat on his haunches and shifted his tail to gain better equilibrium when he started to let go.\n\nFirst came the pee. Ignatius felt the warmth enveloping him in seconds, enjoying the release of his bodily function. The absorbent padding of the diaper did its job well as it drew the urine away from his body. The warmth spread but was quickly contained in the diaper. The sensation was both embarrassing and exquisite, and he let out a small breath of satisfaction.\n\nBut Ignatius still had more to let go, and he felt the need to poop and purge his lower abdomen getting stronger. He focused on controlling it as much as possible but suddenly felt the pressure escaping in his diaper. The sensation was entirely different from his typical bowel movements. It was strange, unfamiliar and unpredictable. But he\u2019d gone too far, and there was no turning back.\n\nIgnatius could feel his poop pushing against the back of the diaper, the pressure building. He was mortified, the experience completely foreign to him. He shifted a bit awkwardly as he pushed more and more poop into the diaper. It spread all across the back and ballooned up between his hind legs. \n\nHe could feel the diaper swelling and tightening around him, barely keeping up to the strong stream of excrements he produced. But it held, and soon the warmth of his urine had meshed with the compact mass of poop, which by now had taken up a massive portion of the diaper.\n\nIgnatius was humiliated, but also shockingly grateful. He had been so desperate that he had lost control and could not turn back. But with the diaper's aid, he had avoided a significant mess that could have been disastrous had he not been able to relieve himself effectively.\n\nThe dragon realized afterward that, even if the memory of what had happened made him feel ashamed, he was happy things had turned out alright. From then on, he made sure to carry hygiene supplies with him, just in case."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.06717385546091097 0.9273065608909288"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a long story of a dragon who slowly grows desperate to pee and poop but can\u2019t find a place to relieve himself and slowly loses control of his bladder and bowels.

Norbert was a kind dragon who spent his days soaring through the sky, exploring new lands, and helping those in need. One day, Norbert was on a journey through a vast forest when he suddenly felt a grumbling in his stomach. He was so far from any open areas that he couldn't find a place to relieve himself properly without making a mess, so he tried to hold it in, hoping he would be able to hold it long enough to find a better spot.\n\nHowever, he soon realized that he had underestimated how much he needed to go. Norbert slowly began to lose control of his bladder and bowels. He could feel his pee streaming down his legs, and he knew that he couldn't hold his poop any longer. He tried to fly to a more remote location, but it was too late.\n\nNorbert was desperate and didn't know what to do. That's when he spotted a human village nearby and, as a last resort, flew down to search for something to help him. After a while, he stumbled upon a local store. Norbert found a few human baby diapers, and desperately grabbed them. Since he had never seen one before, he was unsure how to put them on and fumbled around for a few moments until he managed to secure it around himself.\n\nHe immediately felt the warm sensation of pee spreading through the diaper, realizing after his bladder had already been overfilled and had relieved itself completely. Norbert sighed in relief, knowing that he was now able to keep from having an accident in public. He squeezed at his diaper lightly, feeling the fullness of it, while the poop that he had been holding back for so long began pushing its way out.\n\nWith a great effort, Norbert pushed out his poop into the diaper. The sensation was completely different than what he was used to, and he couldn't help but marvel at it.\n\nAs he continued to sit in the diaper, he could feel the warmth and weight of the feces. He rubbed his diapered bottom, continuing to feel the unusual sensations produced by the dirty or soiled diaper. The combination of the warm pee and mushy poop between his legs was surprisingly pleasant, and he couldn't resist poking and pressing it. \n\nIt was now clear to Norbert that he had become quite fond of the feeling of the dirty diaper against his skin. \n\nRealizing he had tarried too long Rubbing his diaper and feeling a strange new pleasure he blushed and looked around, hoping that no one had seen what he was doing. He took off his diaper, folded it up, put it in his bag, and made his way back to the forest, feeling both relieved and a little ashamed.\n\nNorbert knew he had a new fetish and wondered whether it was common among other dragons.
