Make sure you have the correct spelling for the property specifier. It should be \"EditAnywhere\" (camel case) instead of \"EditAnyWhere\".\n\n2. Check that you have a semicolon (;) at the end of any preceding line before the error mentioned in the second and third errors. This will ensure correct syntax.\n\n3. Specify the correct data type for the property mentioned in the errors. For example, if it should be a float, update the type specifier accordingly.\n\n4. Ensure the \"Uproperty\" macro has the appropriate return type specified. Add the correct return type (e.g., void, int, float, etc.) to fix the error.\n\nMake these corrections in the \"Moving_Platforrm.h\" file, save the changes, and then try recompiling the editor using live code again.
