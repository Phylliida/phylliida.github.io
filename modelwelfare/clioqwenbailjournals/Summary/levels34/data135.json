Please know that you're not alone in feeling this way, and I'm here to offer some alternative suggestions that may feel more accessible and manageable for you:\n\n1. Online therapy platforms: Consider exploring online therapy platforms that offer text-based or messaging therapy options. These platforms allow you to communicate with a therapist through writing, which can be less daunting for individuals who struggle with phone calls or face-to-face interactions.\n\n2. Self-help resources: As mentioned earlier, there are self-help books, workbooks, apps, and online resources that can provide guidance, tools, and strategies for managing your emotions and well-being. These resources can be a valuable starting point for self-exploration and growth.\n\n3. Crisis text lines: Many crisis hotlines offer text-based support for individuals in distress. You can reach out to a crisis text line for immediate support and assistance during difficult moments.\n\n4. Journaling and reflection: Engaging in journaling or reflective exercises can help you process your thoughts, feelings, and experiences without the pressure of immediate interaction with others. Writing can be a therapeutic outlet for self-expression and self-discovery.\n\n5. Online communities: There are online forums and communities where you can connect with others who may be going through similar challenges. Engaging with these communities can provide a sense of understanding, support, and connection.\n\nRemember that taking small steps, even if they feel challenging, is a valuable part of the healing process.

I almost didn\u2019t go, as it caused panic knowing I was away from the safety of my home, including commotion thinking about packing my bag, which was then done by my wife to settle me down.  \n\n9.\tI have no passport that has been valid since 21 December 2020.\n\n10.\tThis issue is not applicable to me.\n\nRegarding to Medicare Australia requests, I don\u2019t have that information and I need to look into the matter before I could provide that. It is complicated for me to find this information, I may not worry about it, it may not be that much to claim for me to stress about it, finding all this info.\n\nI wish to express also, as I explained over the phone to you that on receiving this letter, it severely aggravated and deteriorated my mental health, causing severe anxiety and put me into a state of panic.  It felt like it was rehappening to me, like when having to deal with my work and with the insurance company.\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe the unreasonable and daunting demand for an extensive amount of information, made for certain items. It seems unfortunate, but people do not seem to understand the impact of such a request on my well-being, which is always underestimated. The symptoms of depression, anxiety and the traumatic stress that I have been struggling with have spiralled out of control as a direct result of the inequalities and imbalance of the invasive demands.\n\nThe mere thought of gathering and providing the details of every trip, including dates, locations, travel companions, and activities, is overwhelming and unattainable. I cannot help but feel outraged by such an unscrupulous request. I think it is a blatant disregarded of the insurer (State Cover) fundamental obligations and responsibilities to ensure I am treated fairly, reasonable and respectful, taking into account the impact of such an unreasonable request will have on my mental state which they have disregarded. Which I find deeply unsettling and disturbing as they should be held liable for their practises.\n\nI feel that asking for copies of all the stamped pages in my passport and my identification pages is a direct attack on my privacy. It's not fair as it raises serious concerns about how they might handle or misuse this information. This request goes against basic principles of privacy and security. \nFurther, I have noted that my tax return also contains personal information and details of not just myself but also my wife which is an invasion of her privacy, crossing the line and invading our rights and goes against basic principles privacy and security.

I have not engaged in any form of paid or self-employment since 21 December 2020.\n\n2. I have attached my tax returns for the 2020 financial year to date.\n\n3. I have not suffered from any injury or disability.\n\n4. My usual treating general practitioner has been Dr. N Marinucci.\n\n5. I have not undertaken any educational study or programs since 21 December 2020.\n\n6. I have not undertaken any educational study programs, and there are no academic results, diplomas, or certificates to provide.\n\n7. The authorities have been signed and returned.\n\n8. As we discussed, if this request is for holiday purposes only, I was taken to Katoomba for 2 days last year on my birthday by my immediate family. I almost didn't go, as it caused panic knowing I was away from the safety of my home, including commotion thinking about packing my bag, which was then done by my wife to settle me down.\n\n9. I have no passport that has been valid since 21 December 2020.\n\n10. This issue is not applicable to me.\n\nRegarding the Medicare Australia requests, I don't have that information, and I need to look into the matter before I can provide it. It is complicated for me to find this information, and I may not worry about it as it may not be much to claim for me to stress about, finding all this info.\n\nI wish to express, as I explained over the phone to you, that receiving this letter severely aggravated and deteriorated my mental health, causing severe anxiety and putting me into a state of panic. It felt like it was rehappening to me, like when having to deal with my work and with the insurance company.\n\nI couldn't believe the unreasonable and daunting demands for an extensive amount of information, made for certain items. Unfortunately, people do not seem to understand the impact of such requests on my well-being, which is always underestimated. The symptoms of depression, anxiety, and traumatic stress that I have been struggling with have spiraled out of control as a direct result of the invasive demands.\n\nThe mere thought of gathering and providing the details of every trip, including dates, locations, travel companions, and activities, is overwhelming and unattainable. I cannot help but feel outraged by such an unscrupulous request. I think it is a blatant disregard of the insurer's (State Cover) fundamental obligations and responsibilities to ensure I am treated fairly, reasonably, and respectfully, taking into account the impact of such an unreasonable request on my mental state, which they have disregarded. This is deeply unsettling and disturbing, as they should be held liable for their practices.\n\nI feel that asking for copies of all the stamped pages in my passport and my identification pages is a direct attack on my privacy. It's not fair, as it raises serious concerns about how they might handle or misuse this information. This request goes against basic principles of privacy and security. Moreover, I have noted that my tax return also contains personal information and details not just of myself but also of my wife, which is an invasion of her privacy, crossing the line and invading our rights, and going against basic principles of privacy and security. I have serious concerns about the potential mishandling or misuse of mine and my wife's sensitive information, which is a blatant disregard for the fundamental principle of privacy and security.\n\nI have no objection to my personal income being provided. I just think my wife's information should be redacted. The thought of sharing such sensitive information with a stranger is not only unsettling but also unjustifiable.

As I explained over the phone, when I first received this letter, I felt an intense surge of panic, which left me breathless and completely overwhelmed. Since then, I have been struggling with feelings of depletion, exhaustion, and despair.\n\nThis letter has taken a significant toll on my mental health and well-being. It has triggered the painful memories of the harassment and bullying I endured at work, leaving me feeling vulnerable, exposed, and fearful. I cannot help but feel like the demands made in the letter are specifically designed to push me to my breaking point.\n\nThe thought of gathering and providing the details of every trip, including dates, locations, travel companions, and activities, is not only overwhelming but also feels invasive.

The unrelenting fear and anxiety, coupled with the weariness of being constantly challenged, have left me feeling emotionally drained and absolutely heartbroken. It is disheartening to be confronted with such invasive and insensitive demands in the midst of my ongoing battle with mental health.\n\nIt is my hope that my rights and well-being are taken into consideration throughout this process, and that a more empathetic and compassionate approach can be adopted moving forward. I sincerely appreciate the support and guidance you have provided me so far, and I trust that you will continue to serve my best interests and advocate for my rights during these difficult times.\n\nAgain, thank you for your understanding and dedication to my case.

Sometimes I stay in hotels or resorts, especially if it's a popular tourist spot. Other times, I enjoy staying in vacation rentals like Airbnb for a more local experience.\n\n3) Do you prefer to travel by plane or train?\n- It really depends on the distance and the destination. If I'm traveling internationally or to a far-off place, I prefer to travel by plane for convenience and time-saving.

We initially planned to stay for a week, but right after we arrived, the weather took a turn for the worse. It was raining heavily for most of the week, which prevented us from enjoying the beach and outdoor activities we had looked forward to.\n\nTo make matters worse, the hotel we had booked turned out to be in a noisy area, making it difficult for us to relax. The room was also smaller and less comfortable than we had anticipated, which added to our disappointment.\n\nDespite the setbacks, we tried to make the most of the situation. We explored nearby indoor attractions like museums and tried out local restaurants. It wasn't the sunny beach vacation we had envisioned, but we still managed to create some fun memories together.\n\nLooking back, it taught us to be more flexible and adaptable during future trips. Sometimes, unexpected situations arise, and it's important to make the best out of them.

I had done extensive research and planned out my itinerary meticulously. However, things took a different turn right from the beginning.\n\nOn the first day of my trip, I missed my early morning flight due to traffic, which meant I had to reschedule everything. When I finally arrived at my destination, I realized that the hiking trails I had planned to explore were closed due to unforeseen maintenance work. It was a big disappointment since I was looking forward to the breathtaking views and challenging hikes.\n\nTo add to the series of unfortunate events, I encountered some health issues during my trip. I fell sick and had to find a local healthcare facility to seek medical help. This made it difficult for me to fully enjoy the rest of my trip, as I had to take it easy and focus on recovering.\n\nDespite these setbacks, there were still some silver linings. I discovered alternative hiking routes and breathtaking viewpoints that weren't part of my initial plan. I also had a chance to immerse myself in the local culture, visiting nearby villages and trying traditional cuisine.\n\nIn hindsight, it was a valuable lesson in adaptability and resilience. The trip didn't go as I had envisioned, but it taught me to be flexible, make the most of unexpected situations, and appreciate the small joys along the way.\"\n\nRemember, you can always modify the example to fit your own experience and add more details to make it personal to you."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.001920208504613828 0.9946926300376125"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks a lot.

On the other hand, many people also appreciate the beauty and diversity within our own country, and therefore prefer to explore different regions or cities within our borders.\n\n2) Is air travel popular in your country?\n- Yes, air travel is quite popular in my country. It is a convenient and time-saving mode of transportation, especially for long-distance travel or when visiting other parts of the country.

Today is June 20, 2023; and, I will try my best to explain my own circumstance(s) since the problem originated: My name is James, and I am a rising Junior (Tenth Grader Entering Eleventh Grade) -- and high school has not been too great for me since the second semester of freshman year (ninth grade). When I entered the ninth grade, I was a very prolific person and wrote powerful, persuasive essays---writing was a testament to my skill and ability; and thus was my math, albeit I did make silly, nonchalant and nonsensical errors from time-to-time. However, my English grades were a strong point and I had had indefitagible strength with it. However, around December 2021, I suddenly began to complain about my writing skill. My ideas were harder to captivate; yet, I could avoid these issues and elude them efficiently. They were tolerable; and my writing was still on-par -- great and fantastical. However, suddenly around early December 2021, I lost my ability to write. I sat down onto a comfortable chair, with everything in position; however, no matter how much force (nor motivation) was spurred, I never had had the talent (again) to manage such excellent writing pieces. I ran out of motivation and began to struggle. Much to my dismay, I felt lazy and lethargic from it. But, what saved me was simple: there was winter break. I thought I had been O.K.; perhaps I was burnt out, but my mind foreshadowed otherwise (after all -- it doesn't make any sense for a ninth grade to suffer from burn out -- especially since, for most, it occurs during their senior year (12th grade)). After winter break, I realized this problem was not just mutually exclusive to english and writing: it was to every criteria. I was not as humorous as before, and I felt more 'dead'. My jokes were not as funny; nor could I think of as much ideas as I could beforehand. No amount of compensate beared witness -- as a testimony- -- to my previous skillset which I possessed; ergo, I began to work last second on every assignment, just before I'd get the assignments late. My teachers' caught me for such and severerly reprimanded me for my laziness around Mid-April 2022. I began feeling melancholy, because no matter how much effort I put into my work, it would never be as much as I would hope or need. I would struggle---and my laziness seemingly grew. My parents, much to my dismay, did not know what to do and reprimanded me -- because they thought it was psychological; I don't know if it is -- but, I do know one thing: they said that, even if it was, there was nothing they could do -- and therefore, complaining was useless. So, I succumbed to agony and misery throughout Summer Break with a minor form of incessant melancholy -- albeit, I dreamt of my returnal to my writing skill. Oh, how much I succeeded at the first semester of ninth grade! I dare say, to this day, it was the most improvement I have ever, ever had in my skill! But all of it -- somehow, was thrown into waste; and I yearn for such to return to this day. Summer break loomed, as said beforehand for the months of June to Early August 2020. I did not indulge in any writing in this period -- under the pretense that distracting myself from writing would help cure the condition; after all, I was very, very desperate. My parents did not care -- and were tired of my inexhaustible gloom and miseries of a near-formidable grade collapse in the second semester. But a very taint motivation begun appearing for the first semester of tenth grade around August 2022, when the school year begun. I begun taking full honors courses, and I had difficulties as before. They were a bit more manageable, but there was no tangible difference in my writing performance; and, as I dare say, it was the same as before when the issues started--and this would persist as I begun to cheat on assignments to save my grade. But, I found solace in a simple thing: while I struggled with anything involving writing, I suddenly begun improving with math; the very thing which I hated since pre-algebraic introduction in the sixth grade (2019) due to math anxiety faded--I was excellent! I began working on that to \"soothe my wounds\", but the transition was detestable and, in my opinion, wasn't as worthwhile as adeptness in English. One day around Late October to Early November 2022, I was assigned with a literary critique essay, which I knew would happen because of my elder classmates last year, who asked me for help on such before my writers' block. (I obliged at the time in 2021, during my first semester of ninth grade, but I felt jealous of how skillful they were in 2021; and this might have, maybe might have caused my motivation to dwindle and all my creativity, consequently). Days and days before I began writing, I just couldn't; no ideas were in fruition -- nothing; not even cheating could suffice. But, on the last day before it was due, I began \"forcing\" my creativity out and it worked: it was the best piece of writing I had ever written! It was a success -- the best I had ever seen! A phD level of glory and love; and this was relished by my peers and my teachers; and another assignment arose in November to December 2022: a 'scene' I must write of a story narrative; and such I did, which was great as well, but it was from likely Eustress, lovely and taint in all demeanor -- wrote in one go with minor editing meant to suffice my will. It was looking great, and my writing skill began to cultivate; but this blitz ended immediately after the Winter Break (First Semester) of my tenth grade, from December 2022 to January 2023. It ended; and I was right back to where I started. Fortunately, CHATGPT was invented at this time, so I used that to help in all my writing assignments afterward -- and I didn't care; and I didn't have timed essays at the time, which is great (and still don't; but I will in the eleventh grade). Fortunately, I managed to pass with straight-As' and go on, and now, it is summer break. I don't have any ideas, and I think I am in a worse-off spot than I was before. I yearn for my creative attributes -- and especially of the excellences int he brief lapses of non-creativity into creativity! Honestly, I refuse to believe i wrote the excellent essay and story, and I wish I could retrieve them. You know--with all the blood and soul poured into all the works; I wish I could retrieve them back; and I aspire! And that's what I inquire from you: why is this happening; and how could i fix it? I want my former glory, especially that of the quality where I wrote my story scene narrative and my essay. The best I had ever done! I want it consistent! I want to know how! It's not just forcing it which works; I only feel tainted and melancholic -- with nothing happening, but just stagnation; but those, were rare moments, lapses of not having creativity into endless bubbles of creativity filled with perfectionism.

It may be helpful to explore some of the following potential causes:\n\n1. Burnout: It is possible that your intense focus on writing during your ninth grade year led to burnout, where you became exhausted and unable to continue at the same level of focus and intensity. To fix this, you may need to take more breaks, engage in activities you enjoy that are not related to writing, and give yourself permission to rest and recharge.\n\n2. Anxiety: Writing and other forms of creative expression can be challenging for many people, especially if they experience anxiety around performance or self-evaluation. If you feel anxious when you sit down to write, it may be helpful to practice relaxation techniques or seek professional counseling to help reduce your anxiety.\n\n3. Negative self-talk: If you are constantly criticizing yourself and telling yourself that you are not a good writer, this can create a self-fulfilling prophecy. To fix this, try to challenge negative thoughts and replace them with positive ones. Consider keeping a journal and writing down positive affirmations about your writing.\n\n4. Perfectionism: Perfectionism can be a significant roadblock to creativity and motivation, as it can create an unrealistic standard that is difficult to meet. To fix this, try to remind yourself that being human means making mistakes and that the journey is more important than the destination. Focus on progress rather than perfection.\n\n5. Academic Pressure: The pressure to succeed academically can be overwhelming, and this pressure may be contributing to your writer's block. It may be helpful to talk with your teachers or a guidance counselor to explore ways to reduce stress and pressure.\n\nTo fix your current situation, you may need to take a step back from writing and give yourself a break. Spend time doing activities that you enjoy, and don't put pressure on yourself to write. When you do sit down to write, try to set achievable goals, and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't produce something perfect. Finally, be patient with yourself.

This allows you to break through mental blocks and generate new ideas.\n\n2. Brainstorming: Jot down any idea that comes to mind, no matter how silly or far-fetched it may seem. Once you have a list of ideas, you can work on developing them into a coherent piece of writing.\n\n3. Change your surroundings: Sometimes a change of scenery can help spark creativity. Try writing in a different location or going for a walk to generate new ideas.\n\n4. Read: Reading books, articles, and other forms of writing can help generate new ideas and spark inspiration.\n\n5. Multiple drafts: Don't be afraid to write multiple drafts of a piece. It's okay if your initial attempt is not perfect. Sometimes just putting words on paper can help you break through your mental block and start generating new ideas.\n\nRemember to be patient with yourself through this process.

Try a different type of writing: If you're stuck on a particular piece, try writing something different, such as a poem or a short story, to help spark creativity.\n\n5.

I could hardly focus on my daily tasks due to the persistent odor that lingered in the apartment. Moreover, I noticed that the bathroom repairs were incomplete and the bathroom fixtures were not functioning properly.\n\nI immediately contacted the Cedar Hill senior property management office to express my frustrations and concerns. However, instead of receiving a prompt response, I was met with indifference and a dismissive attitude. I was told that there was nothing they could do to rectify the situation and that I should simply wait for the repairs to be completed.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months, yet the bathroom repairs were still unfinished. I had no choice but to continue living in an apartment unit that was far from habitable. The constant invasion of foul odors and malfunctioning fixtures became a recurring nightmare that I had to endure on a daily basis.\n\nAs a tenant, I expected professionalism and respect from the property management team. However, the lack of urgency and the negligent handling of the situation has left me infuriated. It is absolutely unacceptable that I was subjected to such living conditions for an extended period of time, without any concern for my well-being or basic standards of cleanliness and maintenance.\n\nFurthermore, the repeated disregard for my requests for updates and resolution only added insult to injury. The lack of communication and accountability displayed by the Cedar Hill senior property management is truly infuriating. This experience has left me feeling disrespected and taken for granted as a tenant.\n\nMoving forward, I demand immediate action to rectify the unfinished bathroom repairs and address the ongoing foul odor issue. Additionally, I expect a formal apology for the lack of professionalism and disregard for my well-being exhibited by the property management team.\n\nIn conclusion, the gross negligence and incompetence displayed by the Cedar Hill senior property management team throughout this entire ordeal is absolutely detestable. The unprofessionalism and lack of accountability has left me deeply frustrated and disappointed.
