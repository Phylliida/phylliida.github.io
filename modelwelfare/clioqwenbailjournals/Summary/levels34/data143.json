Set Up Default Styling Parameters:\n- First, establish a set of base styling parameters. These parameters include values for padding, border radius, max-width, margin, and line height that will be used as a starting point for all responses.\n\n2. Emotional Analysis of Input:\n- Develop a method to analyze the input text for emotional content. This analysis will categorize the input into emotional states like \u2018joy\u2019, \u2018sadness\u2019, \u2018anger\u2019, etc., and this information will be used to inform the style of the response.\n\n3. Style Determination Based on Emotion:\n- For each detected emotion, map a corresponding background color that best represents that emotional state visually. Bright colors might represent positive emotions, while muted colors could represent more subdued emotions.\n- Choose a text color that offers high contrast against the selected background color to ensure readability.\n\n4. Crafting the Response Text:\n- Generate the response text taking into account the detected emotional context. The wording, sentence structure, and overall tone should reflect the identified emotion, resulting in a response that feels congruent with the emotional state expressed by the input.\n\n5. Constructing a Single-Line HTML Response:\n- Start by composing the CSS style declaration. This should begin with a &lt;style&gt; tag and include styles such as background color, text color, and other base styles that were determined by the emotional analysis.\n- Prepare the HTML content by wrapping the crafted response text inside an HTML container, like a &lt;div&gt; element, and give it a unique ID.\n- In the response text, ensure that all line breaks are converted into &lt;br&gt; tags to adhere to the formatting rules.\n- Concatenate the CSS and HTML content into a single string without any new lines, except for the ones explicitly created by &lt;br&gt; tags within the HTML content.\n\n6. Ensuring Adherence to the Golden Rules:\n- Make sure the resulting HTML string starts with the style definition immediately followed by the HTML content without any new lines between them.\n- Verify that no extra new lines are introduced in the output.\n- Follow a consistent ID naming strategy for the HTML container and its contents, incrementing the ID numbers with each new message to maintain uniqueness.\n\nBy following these steps, the resulting implementation will generate responses that are styled in a way that visually conveys the emotional tone detected in the input while strictly adhering to the formatting requirements outlined in the five golden rules. The process encapsulates the essence of the SAENG concept, creating an interaction that is not just textually but also visually responsive to the user\u2019s emotional state.\n\n\n\n\n\nyou can even

If you represent an investor in the project, please know we have sent this email and information to the current email address on file, but it may be helpful if you forward to your clients as well.\n \nPlease find attached project update documents for March 2023. Please read each of these documents carefully and fully.  We will follow up with a Mandarin translation of the documents as soon as they are ready.  \n \nSome important information as it relates to the EB5 Investment:\n \nThe attachment (March 2023 Gaslamp Financial - Pendry Investment Update) provides a narrative summary of the current project status.  There are also attachments providing an income statement for 2022 actuals and the 2023 budget.\n \nThe attached document (PSD - Refinance Status EB5 Overview) explains in detail the following:   the senior loan to the project borrower had a maturity of October 2022 with a 1-year extension to October 2023.  The project owner hired a national firm (www.eastdilsecured.com) to source new debt but had difficulty getting a new loan because of the rapid increase in interest rates.  The existing senior lender agreed to a new extension of the loan to the project borrower but required a further extension of EB5 loans so the EB5 loans would mature up to a year after the senior loan.  As the general partner for the two EB5 lenders, EB5 Group agreed to an extension of the EB5 loans until April 2027, a 16-month extension to the maturity date from the 2020 negotiations.  In consideration of this extension, the EB5 lenders obtained the following additional benefits:\n \n1) The EB5 loans now have priority of repayment over all borrower common equity.  Previously, during the prior pandemic emergency financing in 2020, the borrower required that the EB5 loans be paid back at the same time as the common equity on a parri passu basis, which means for every $100 of cash available after paying off the senior debt and other senior obligations, the EB5 lenders would get $67 and the common equity would get $33.  EB5 Group agreed to this at the time back in 2020 based on the dire refinancing and other financial risk facing the project, but since the approval of the EB5 lenders was again needed for the current refinancing, EB5 Group required that repayment of the EB5 loans have full priority of repayment prior to any payments to the common equity holders.  The project borrower now has $26,905,000 of equity invested in the project, and under the terms of the new refinancing the EB5 loans will now get 100% of cash flow after repayment of the senior loans and any other senior obligations.\n \n2) The project borrower and its common equity owners cannot take any cash flow payments from the project.  If there is any positive cash flow from operations after satisfying the current senior loan debt service obligations and approved, budgeted operating expenses, those funds must be used to pay down the EB5 loans.  This should mean that the project borrower and its common equity owners will not receive any cash from the project until the EB5 loans are repaid.\n \nIn addition to the senior loan, the project borrower was successful in refinancing the preferred equity from Sabal put in place during the 2020 refinancing that was priced at 18% interest.  The new refinancing loan interest rate is 13.4%.\n \nThe combined capital stack of the project is as follows:\n \nSenior and Mezz Loan:  $131.8M\nEB5 Loans:                      $  56.0M (not including accrued interest)\nBorrower Equity:            $  27.0M\nTotals                             $214.8M\n \nThe hotel property needs a value of at least $187M (after fees) to fully pay back the EB5 loans.  Based on the 2023 expected EBITDA of $12,740,052, the project needs to sell at a cap rate of 6.8% or lower to achieve this result.  However, the project borrower anticipates the project performance will continue to improve over the extension period of the EB5 loans and has advised that it intends to repay the EB5 loans prior to the new maturity date of April 2027.\n \nThere was an update completed in August 2022, for which we learned that many investors did not receive.  We have attached the update narrative to this email. Please see attachment August 2022 Gaslamp Financial - Pendry Investment Update.\n \n \n[The below information was the email provided in February 2022.  Our primary goals remain unchanged.  All compensation to EB5 Group and outside agents has stopped and will remain that way until we can be certain that EB5 Investors achieve a full return of their investment. Some agents are still asking for their payments even though the investors have had to endure long extensions of their investment without a return.  For complete transparency, we have told these agents they are not to receive any compensation until investors receive 100% of their investment back.]\n \nAttached is a supplemental update dated February 2022 in both English and Mandarin, along with associated support documents for this update.  We intend to send a future update around September 2022.  We are not resending these attachments with the March 2023 update.\n \nWe continue to have two primary goals:  \n \n1) Comply with all USCIS requirements regarding your investment to ensure that all investors that wish to continue their immigration process have the best chances for success in this regard.  The Pendry project has met all requirements for job creation and hopefully with the reauthorization of the EB5 program USCIS will (timely) continue processing cases and any backlog will end.  Many investors have already filed their 829 package and we are hopeful that approvals of those filings will occur as soon as possible.\n \n2) Do all we can to protect your investment.  As has been highlighted in all prior updates, the hospitality industry has had a very challenging two years, primarily due to COVID and the consequences and economic impacts related to the pandemic.  We worked diligently with Pendry ownership to save the project from the senior lender's desire to sell its loan after the economy shut-down, likely to a predatory lender, which we learned the potential new lender would likely foreclose the entire EB5 investment; and, even though your immigration goals would still be achievable there would have been a likely full loss of the investment.  Separately, the project owner asked EB5 Lender to write-down its loan by $17M in order for ownership to have an inducement to continue with the project that seemingly no longer had profit potential at the time.  We did not agree to the write down (loss) on the EB5.  Neither of these outcomes was considered acceptable to EB5 Lender.  In order to stave off this potential for loss of the EB5 loans, we agreed to some loan concessions with Pendry ownership whereby interest was waived for a period of time and the maturity of the EB5 loans was extended as well.  We negotiated some enhanced provisions within our loan documents but the collateral for our EB5 loans still remains a pledged percentage of the equity interests of the owners.  In addition to our loan modifications, the Pendry owners received a new preferred equity commitment of $23M from a third party investor, as required by the senior lender, to cover operations expenses during the low performance period and to also pay down the senior loan.\n \nThe efforts made to help stabilize the Pendry seem to have worked.  The operating performance of the hotel has beat revised owner expectations and we hope it continues to perform well.  However, this is still a challenging time for hospitality projects.  Inflation rates and interest rates make the likelihood of a refinance of the project more difficult.  Values for hotel projects have been impacted given the prior shut-down(s) of the economy.  The Pendry owners still have another 2.5 years before the EB5 loan final maturity.  We have no options to force a payoff any sooner than the maturity.  We will continue to request the Pendry owners do whatever is possible to repay the EB5 as soon as possible.\n \nInvestors that have withdrawn their EB5 petition or are no longer pursuing EB5 are in the same position of waiting for the loans to mature before they receive investment proceeds back.  We have asked Pendry ownership to find a way to return funds sooner but they have indicated that no funds are available for this purpose.\n \nFor our part, Gaslamp Financial I and II has waived any earnings or management fees from the time of the loan modifications and will continue to do so until the time investors are likely to receive 100% of their investment returned.  We have also told agents affiliated with investors that their invoices sent for payment of interest will not be paid until there are funds available AFTER investors have received their full investment returned.  It is our strong opinion and belief, given the circumstances of the investment and concerns of full repayment, that Agents and Gaslamp Financial I and II should not continue to earn fees/interest until your investment is likely to be fully returned.  To the credit of many of the agents, they have agreed with this position and want to make sure investors (and a return of their investment) are the priority.\n \nIt is interesting to note that the owners of the Pendry San Diego are moving forward with another hotel project in a different location in California and for which they intend to raise EB5 monies.  We will not be involved in any current or future projects with the Pendry San Diego owners.\n \nWe continue to remain hopeful that continued improvement in the Pendry operations will translate into a full repayment of your investment.  The twice a year updates provide a check point for the investment and some operating performance metrics.  Any events considered material or important will be disclosed to investors if they occur prior to our scheduled update timeframe.\n \nPlease let us know if you should have any questions. \n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The email is an update on the Gaslamp Financial I or II EB5 project investment.
