We need to find a way out of this toxic cycle.\n\nChandler's anger subsides momentarily as he realizes the impact of his actions.

The Resource-Based View (RBV) perspective suggests that IT capabilities can be leveraged as valuable resources that contribute to a hospital's competitive advantage. \n\nThe traditional physical IT infrastructure, such as servers, networks, and hardware, may still play a crucial role in supporting digital transformation, but it has evolved into a resource that is more integrated and interconnected with other IT capabilities. For instance, cloud computing, data analytics, and cybersecurity are some of the new IT capabilities that have emerged in recent years, and they are transforming the way hospitals manage and use health data, collaborate with stakeholders, and deliver healthcare services.\n\nWith the emergence of these new IT capabilities, hospitals can now build more agile, scalable, and user-centric digital solutions that improve patient outcomes, reduce costs, and enhance efficiency. The role of IT in digital transformation is no longer just about providing technical support or maintaining systems, but also about driving innovation, improving decision-making, and enabling collaboration across the healthcare ecosystem. \n\nIn summary, physical IT infrastructure remains a vital capability in supporting digital transformation, but its role has evolved to become more integrated with other digital resources and capabilities. As hospitals strive to innovate and deliver better outcomes, they must leverage these capabilities effectively and strategically as resources to gain competitive advantage."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.004588051957644232 0.9907432219418313"}, {"role": "user", "content": "only revise: 1.\tWhat roles do IT capabilities play in digital transformation of hospitals based on the RBV?
