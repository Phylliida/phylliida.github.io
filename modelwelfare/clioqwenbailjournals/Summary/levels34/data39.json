He starts cleaning the counters even though they\u2019re already spotless, then rearranges the sugar packets and napkins on the tables in a precise pattern. Jen giggles at his odd behavior, but Sandra just keeps talking to her calmly, like nothing\u2019s wrong.\n\n\u201cDavid, why don\u2019t you come over here for a minute?\u201d Sandra says, beckoning him over to the two women. \u201cI want you to stand right here, facing me.\u201d\n\nDavid obediently complies, standing in front of Sandra with his hands clasped behind his back.
