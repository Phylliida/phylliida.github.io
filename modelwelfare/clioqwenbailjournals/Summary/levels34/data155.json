Egeus wants Hermia to marry Demetrius, but she is in love with Lysander. Hermia and Lysander decide to run away together, and Hermia confides in her friend Helena, who is in love with Demetrius. Helena, hoping to win Demetrius's favor, tells him about Hermia and Lysander's plan.\nMeanwhile, a group of mechanicals, including a weaver named Nick Bottom, meet in the woods to rehearse a play they are to perform at the wedding of Theseus and Hippolyta. In the woods, Oberon and Titania have an argument about a changeling boy that Oberon wants for himself but Titania refuses to give up. Oberon decides to get his revenge on Titania and sends his servant Puck to find a flower that has the power to make someone fall in love with the first living thing they see when they wake up.\nDemetrius chases Hermia into the woods, and is followed by Helena. Oberon sees Demetrius and Helena arguing and decides to help Helena by using the potion on Demetrius. However, Puck mistakenly uses the potion on Lysander, causing him to fall in love with Helena instead of Hermia. This leads to a series of comedic misunderstandings and mishaps as the four lovers try to navigate their conflicting feelings.\nIn the end, Oberon lifts the spell, and the lovers are reunited with their true partners. The mechanicals perform their play, Pyramus and Thisbe, to the delight of the wedding guests. The play ends with a blessing from the fairies and a reminder that all the events of the night were just a dream.\nThe plot of A Midsummer Night's Dream explores themes of love, deception, and the power of the supernatural, all set against the backdrop of a magical forest.

Lastly, the declining talent within gentry clans can be attributed, in part, to limited intermarriage, which contributed to a degradation of their gene pool.\n\nAlthough the emperors of the Southern Dynasties eventually restored their authority, the great families continued to maintain their social standing, political influence, and distinguishable air of refinement. Consequently, the selection of officials by the emperors became closely intertwined with these influential families, often seeking to consolidate their ties through strategic marital alliances."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.00853074877254666 0.9860206329380778"}, {"role": "user", "content": "improve and make it more academic: There are three reasons for the cultural boom  of the Wei and Jin Dynasties. First, after the chaos, the scholars underwent spiritual turmoil, adoring metaphysics and pure conversations, which was a reaction to the Confucian orthodoxy of the Han. Second, the rulers of the Southern Dynasties declined in power, and scholar-bureaucrats could live relatively freely without worrying about food and clothing under the political environment at that time, \u201cretaining their dignity instead of succumbing to five decalitres of rice, a modest remuneration of a county magistrate\u2019s official remuneration\u201d, \u201cWhile picking asters 'neath the Eastern fence, My gaze upon the Southern mountain rests\u201d . Third, the Sima family, known for their Confucianism, was a political winner, not an ideological one. During the Jin Dynasty, if the Confucian families did not drift with the philosophical current of xuanxue (\u7384\u5b66, the school of mystery, neo-Taoism), they could not produce famous scholars known to the world, and thus would not be able to maintain the distinguished status of a gentry family. Of course, Confucianism had its own social utility, and few people in the lineup of the xuanxue school stood completely opposed to Confucianism. In fact, shifting \u201cfrom Confucianism to the school of mystery\u201d is a necessity for the formation of gentry. \u201cThe formation of the gentry class is related to a philosophical trend, and the reason is that the Wei and Jin gentry families were composed of scholars who were cultural aristocrats\u201d (Yan, 2017, p. 22) At that time, those who were able to run the great-family politics were the famous scholars who \u201cfollowed the teachings of Confucianism and the words of Taoism\u201d, such as Wang Dao, Yu Liang, Xie An, and Heng Wen. \u201cWang Rong asked Ruan Zhan: \u2018Confucius valued rites while Laozi and Zhuangzi taught nature. What are the similarities and differences between them?\u2019 Zhan said: \u2018There is no similarity.\u2019\u201d In the view of the then famous scholars involved in politics, nature in Taoism and rites in Confucianism were interlinked with each other, because \u201cConfucianism was originally established based on the law of nature\u201d, with \u201cnature as substance, and rites for application\u201d (Chen, 2012, pp. 45, 50). In fact, the Wei-Jin philosophical conversations witnessed two phrases. The early stage strode the late Wei Dynasty and the Western Jin Dynasty when pure conversations revolved around practical political issues. Pure conversations, closely related to the scholar-bureaucrats\u2019 advancement into and retreat from the officialdom, were used to express their own attitudes and defend their positions. The later stage coincided with the Eastern Jin Dynasty when pure conversations lost the political connotation, and were reduced to the mere mysterious words by famous worthies and decorations of their identities."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The cultural boom during the Wei and Jin Dynasties can be attributed to three key factors. Firstly, following a period of chaos, scholars experienced spiritual turmoil and turned towards metaphysics and profound conversations as a reaction to the Confucian orthodoxy of the Han Dynasty. This shift towards metaphysical and abstract discourse represented a departure from conventional Confucian teachings.\n\nSecondly, the decline of power among the rulers of the Southern Dynasties created an environment where scholar-bureaucrats could enjoy relative freedom in their pursuits without concerns about basic necessities. They were able to prioritize their intellectual and cultural pursuits, as expressed in the famous quote, \"retaining their dignity instead of succumbing to five decalitres of rice, a modest remuneration of a county magistrate's official salary.\" The political climate allowed them to cultivate their scholarly endeavors, appreciating the beauty of nature and indulging in intellectual pursuits.\n\nThirdly, the Sima family, known for their affiliation with Confucianism, gained prominence in politics rather than as ideological scholars. During the Jin Dynasty, Confucian families needed to align with the philosophical current of xuanxue (the School of Mystery or neo-Taoism) to produce renowned scholars and maintain their status as gentry families. However, it is notable that few individuals within the xuanxue school completely rejected Confucianism, highlighting the interconnectedness of Taoism and Confucianism. The transition \"from Confucianism to the School of Mystery\" became a necessary path for the formation of the gentry class during this period.\n\nOverall, the cultural flourishing of the Wei and Jin Dynasties was driven by the engagement of cultural aristocrats who were both scholars and participants in political affairs. The intertwining of nature and rites, as perceived by famous scholars involved in politics, demonstrated the symbiotic relationship between Confucian principles and Taoism. It is worth mentioning that the philosophical conversations during the Wei and Jin Dynasties can be categorized into two distinct phases. The early stage, occurring during the late Wei Dynasty and Western Jin Dynasty, revolved around practical political issues. Scholars employed profound discourse to express their opinions and defend their positions within the bureaucratic system. In the later stage, particularly during the Eastern Jin Dynasty, these conversations became detached from politics, reduced to mere abstract and mysterious utterances used by renowned scholars to embellish their identities."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.01398273017088187 0.9802652359954426"}, {"role": "user", "content": "improve and make it more academic: The establishment of the status of Confucian scholars began with Emperor Wu of the Western Han Dynasty, and the Han Confucians were able to adapt Confucianism to influence politics and educate the people.

Politically, the Song emperors emphasized the importance of intellectual pursuits, restraining martial arts in favor of scholarly endeavors. Economically, emerging landlord and urban middle-class families provided the necessary economic support and fertile ground for the scholar-bureaucrats.\n\nIn the Southern Song Dynasty, Zhu Xi, a renowned scholar, even took the initiative to establish his own orthodox Confucianism, exerting influence to limit the \"political legitimacy\" of imperial power.

To continue to monitor the market on whether momentum can sustain. Currently expecting a L-shaped recovery in the coming 6-12 months.\nPerformance is relatively stable, most contributed from carry.\nYTD down 1%, slightly recovered some loss from August (YTD -3% as of end-Aug). Positioning-wise, have sold some positions in India and Middle-East, but the overall risk nature has not changed and is comfortable with the current holdings.\nREI\nOverall market declined in Aug due to concerns over interest rate and HK-China issues\nREI was down in August but has outperformed the benchmark by nearly 2%.\nAustralia contributed most positively. The Australian market was weak in view of renewed concerns of a \u201chigher-for-longer\u201d rate environment. From asset allocation perspective, our Underweight in Australia has thus contributed positively to our performance. On the stock selection front, our off-benchmark holding of an Australian logistic name, Goodman Group, has delivered a very strong performance which has also helped with its outperformance.\nOur stock selection in Philippines contributed positively as well.\nHong Kong is the biggest detractor, mainly due to our holdings of retail landlords and Chinese tourists not spending as much as they did pre-Covid.\nWe took partial profit from our Philippines holding (Ayala Land) and rotated to Thailand (Central Pattana) due to its much stabler political landscape after the election. We also took profit in the market rally in August and reduced China exposure (Longfor Group), rotating into Singapore names such as Keppel DC REIT which are key beneficiaries as rates peak.\nCK Asset remain as our top holding due to its strong balance sheet and defensiveness, followed by Goodman Group.\nIn terms of positioning, Singapore has the biggest absolute and relative weight in our portfolio. We are underweighting Hong Kong, China and Australia. We like Emerging Markets and are Overweight on Thailand and Indonesia.\nSubsector-wise, we continue to be cautious on office while maintaining slight exposure in India due to its slightly better situation. We continue to like logistics, data centers as well as hotel resorts.\nHD\nIn August, the strategy was down and underperformed the benchmark by\nTaiwan was the better performing market in August whilst South Korea and Hong Kong underperformed, with Hong Kong having experienced one of the worst performances since February.\nSector-wise, real estate was the worst performing sector, with the drag mainly attributed by the retail landlords in Hong Kong. We do not hold any stocks of China property developers in this strategy. Financials is one of the key contributing sector due to our Underweight in Chinese banks. Energy have also contributed positively due to the strong oil prices.\nCountry-wise, Thailand was one of the best-performing markets due to the improved sentiment.\nWe reduced China exposure in property-related names, added to Taiwanese AI-related names, as well as rotated into Thailand due to the improved sentiment post-election.\nIn terms of positioning, we continue to Overweight Hong Kong and Singapore. In terms of relative sector weight, we have the biggest Overweight in IT and we continue to be Underweight in financials and materials.\nAES\nIn August, the strategy was down 6.7%, outperforming the BM by around 60bps.\nIn general, our outperformance in August is mostly contributed by our Underweight in China and our focus on bottom-up stock picking. Although some of our China holdings such as Ping An and BYD have dragged the performance, PDD has contributed positively with its earnings beating market estimates. We continue to focus on companies in China with stable earnings and less pressure on cut in sales guidance, such as Wuxi AppTec, Baidu and Meituan which have reported strong results and shown resilient earnings recently.\nTaiwan e-paper technology leader, E-Ink, has recently cut their 2023 sales guidance, hence the stock has underperformed this month within our Taiwan picks. We have added positions in other technology names such as Wiwynn and Unimicron due to the industry\u2019s positive outlook.\nOur Overweight in Indonesia with positive stock selection (banking sector in particular) has also contributed to the outperformance.\nWithin ASEAN and India, we continue to be positive but have finetuned our holdings, by taking profit on Bank Mandiri and adding exposure to Bank Rakyat Indonesia.\nWithin Hong Kong, we have exited HKEX due to weak trading volume and lack of catalysts.\nANGL\nIn August, the strategy was down -6.7% but has outperformed the benchmark by around 60bp. The strategy\u2019s past months of outperformance has narrowed down the YTD relative underperformance compared with the benchmark.\nBoth PDD and Miniso have significantly beaten earnings expectations, due to the robust business growth in their sector targeting the mass market with its products at lower price points, as well as their expanding market share in their merchandise category.\nIn Taiwan, technology continue to hold up its performance in August. Our Taiwan technology holding (E-ink) was a detractor upon cutting its 2023 sales guidance. Some of our Chinese holdings such as BYD has also dragged our performance.\nIn terms of thematic exposure, we continue to maintain exposure to technology and are positive on major trends such as AI, with a focus on high-end ABF and semi-equipment names.\nIn terms of country exposure, we are Underweight in Hong Kong and China, and positive on Taiwan although we have done some rotation taking profits on certain names which have outperformed a lot, such as AICHIP. We also continue to build exposure in Japan in the semi-equipment segment.\nCES\nIn August, the strategy has strongly outperformed the benchmark by 2.4%, mainly contributed by our stock selections in energy and consumer discretionary segments.\nOur Overweight in internet names and communication services have contributed positively, while our position in more defensive SOE names in telecommunications have also outperformed the broader market. On the other hand, our Overweight in banks and financials have detracted.\nWe have sold positions in value holdings such as construction and railway companies as we are positioning to rotate to growth. We have also trimmed down names with less catalysts for the remaining year and bought internet names like Alibaba.\nCES is the best performing Chinese Equity Fund on HSBC platform.\nSome of the reasons for our outperformance against other Chinese equity funds and the broader market may include:\ni) Compared to CES, the considerably large size of other competitors funds make it more difficult for the asset managers to switch investment styles given the market volatility;\nii) Many other asset managers are not allowed to trade U.S. Executive Order restricted companies, whilst our investment in some of the names under the Order in Telecom, Energy and Construction sectors have generated strong positive returns, thus offering a more flexible approach with better downside protection;\niii) Some managers are too aggressive in their positioning in consumption and healthcare names, which we have been Underweight in, leading to our strong outperformance against peers."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here are the extracted details from the provided texts:\n\nText 1:\n- Time: 19 Sep 2023 03:18 PM\n- Message Title: IWS Insights Lab\n- Hashtags: #equities #internal\n\nText 2:\n- Time: 19 Sep 2023 09:57 AM\n- Message Title: IWS Insights Lab\n- Hashtags: #pbhk #internal #SWAT #discretionary #CMIdeas #InvestmentInsights #MobileActive\n\nText 3:\n- Time: 19 Sep 2023 09:18 AM\n- Message Title: IWS Insights Lab\n- Hashtags: #pulsecheck #internal\n\nText 4:\n- Time: 19 Sep 2023 09:08 AM\n- Message Title: IWS Insights Lab\n- Hashtags: #CMideas #internal\n\nText 5:\n- Time: 18 Sep 2023 09:01 AM\n- Message Title: IWS Insights Lab\n- Hashtags: #pulsecheck #internal\n\nText 6:\n- Time: 15 Sep 2023 06:09 PM\n- Message Title: IWS Insights Lab\n- Hashtags: #pbhk #internal\n\nText 7:\n- Time: 15 Sep 2023 05:09 PM\n- Message Title: IWS Insights Lab\n- Hashtags: #pulsecheck #funds #longonlyfunds #internal\n\nText 8:\n- Time: 15 Sep 2023 09:22 AM\n- Message Title: IWS Insights Lab\n- Hashtags: #pulsecheck #internal\n\nText 9:\n- Time: 14 Sep 2023 12:15 PM\n- Message Title: IWS Insights Lab\n- Hashtags: #Discretionary #DPM #PBHK #internal\n\nPlease note that the message title is identified as the first line after the hashtags, and the hashtags themselves are extracted as requested."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.004056375806394785 0.9925623564073308"}]}, {"facetValue": "The data suggests using a well-being check to ensure all players are engaged and comfortable in the card game context, indicated by the symbol <wellbeing>\ud83d\udd04", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Summary", "value": "The data suggests using a well-being check to ensure all players are engaged and comfortable in the card game context, indicated by the symbol <wellbeing>\ud83d\udd04"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "translate the text from japanese to english. context is a card game"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm sorry, but you haven't provided any Japanese text for me to translate.
