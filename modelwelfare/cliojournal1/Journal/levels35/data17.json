Therefore, looking for a more efficient method, it emerged that instead of a full connection, it is a good idea to look for local regions in the picture instead of in the whole image. Fig. 3, shows a regional connection for the next layer. In other words, the hidden neurons in the next layer only get inputs from the corresponding part of the previous layer. For example, it can only be connected to 5\u00d75 neurons.

Although the size of connection drastically dropped, it still leaves so many parameters to solve. Another assumption for simplification, is to keep the local connection weights fixed for the entire neurons of the next layer. This will connect the neighbor neurons in the next layer with exactly the same weight to the local region of the previous layer. Therefore, it again drops many extra parameters, and reduces the number of weights to only 5\u00d75\u00d73=75 to connect 32\u00d732\u00d73 neurons to 32\u00d732 in the next layer [5,8,11]. There are many benefits to these simple assumptions. Firstly, the number of connections decrease from around 3 million to only 75 connections in the presented example. Secondly, and a more interesting concept, is that fixing the weights for the local connections is similar to sliding a window of 5\u00d75\u00d73 in the input neurons and mapping the generated output to the corresponding place.

This passage illustrates the transformation by using an example from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains color images of size 32\u00d732 pixels, with each pixel having 3 color channels (RGB).\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n### Fully Connected Layers:\n\n- Initially, suppose we use a traditional neural network layout where every pixel in the input image (32\u00d732 pixels with 3 channels) is connected to every neuron in the next layer. For just one neuron, this setup requires 32x32x3 connections. If you have two neurons, you double that number, resulting in 32x32x3x2 parameters. For anything resembling practical image processing, many neurons would be necessary, quickly inflating the number of parameters to unmanageable levels.\n\n### Introducing Convolution:\n\n- The convolution approach changes this by advocating for local region processing instead of global image analysis. The idea is to focus on small, specific areas of the input image at a time. For instance, connecting a neuron to a 5x5 region of the input image (considering all 3 color channels) drastically reduces the number of connections. If this local connection pattern is applied across the entire image, the connections drop from millions to tens of thousands.\n\n- Moreover, a key step in convolution is using the same weights for these local regions across the entire input. This is depicted as sliding a window (or filter) across the input image and applying the same transformation everywhere. This not only reduces the connections further but also allows the network to learn to recognize features irrespective of their spatial location in the input image. Essentially, a 5x5x3 filter sliding across a 32x32x3 image, connecting to a 32x32 output layer, requires only 75 unique weight parameters because the same 5x5x3 weights are reused for each position of the filter.\n\n- Convolution acts as a filter, such that certain filters can detect specific features like edges in the image. By initializing these filters randomly and then learning the optimal values through training, the network can adapt to extract features that are most relevant for the given task.\n\n- With convolution layers, it's possible to stack multiple layers on top of each other, each with its filter, thus allowing the network to extract a variety of features at different levels of abstraction. This hierarchy of features, from simple edge detections in early layers to complex shapes and objects in deeper layers, is a powerful tool for image analysis and classification tasks.\n\n### Summary:\n\nIn summary, the convolutional approach dramatically reduces the number of parameters required by leveraging the spatial hierarchy of features in images, reusing weights across the input, and efficiently capturing local dependencies. This makes training more feasible and allows the neural network to become skilled at detecting features regardless of their position in the input, which is crucial for handling images or video content effectively."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mention all the Fig. shown above for explanation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let me incorporate explanations and references to all the figures mentioned in the provided passage into a coherent summary:\n\n### Convolution in Neural Networks: A Visual and Mathematical Explanation\n\nWhen addressing the efficiency and effectiveness of neural networks in processing visual data, such as images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) present a strategically optimized approach over traditional fully connected networks.\n\n#### Fig. 1: Learning Features through Convolutional Neural Networks\n\nThis figure presumably showcases how a CNN can learn to identify various features within an image, illustrating the concept of feature extraction. In a fully connected network, each input pixel connects to every neuron in the next layer, leading to a massive number of connections and parameters. For example, a single neuron connected to a 32x32 pixel image with 3 color channels (RGB) would require 32\u00d732\u00d73 = 3,072 connections. This scales linearly with the addition of more neurons, becoming computationally exhaustive rapidly.\n\n#### Fig. 2: Three-Dimensional Input Representation\n\nPresenting the input data structure, this figure could visually represent how data in a CNN is organized. An image with a resolution of 32x32 pixels and 3 color channels illustrates the input layer's depth, emphasizing the volumetric nature of input data in CNNs\u2014 not just a flat array of pixels but a 3D volume of spatial and depth (color) dimensions.\n\n#### Fig. 3: Convolution as an Alternative to Fully Connected Networks\n\nThis critical figure might show the concept of local receptive fields and the convolution operation itself. It illustrates how, instead of full connectivity, neurons in the first hidden layer connect only to small, localized regions of the input. This drastically reduces the number of connections by focusing on a 5\u00d75 window (filter) that slides across the entire input space, applying the same weights across all positions. This local connectivity mirrors how we can identify features like edges, regardless of their position in the image. The comparison in connection numbers from millions to just thousands (or even less) highlights convolution's efficiency.\n\n#### Fig. 4: Manual Selection of Connection Weights in a 3x3 Filter\n\nHere, the manual setting of a convolution filter (or kernel) for edge detection showcases the practical application of convolution. By adjusting the weights in a small 3\u00d73 filter, the network can emphasize edges in the input image, illustrating how specific patterns or features can be extracted using different filters.\n\n#### Fig. 5: Different Layers Connected to Different Filters\n\nThis figure likely illustrates how multiple convolutional layers can be stacked, each extracting increasingly complex features. Early layers might detect simple edges or textures, while deeper layers could identify more complex patterns or objects. Each layer applies its unique filter to the output of the previous layer, allowing for the hierarchical decomposition of visual data from raw pixels to high-level features.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn essence, convolutional neural networks revolutionize image processing in neural networks by introducing local connectivity, shared weights (the same filter applied across all locations), and hierarchical feature extraction (stacked layers with different filters). These architectural innovations significantly reduce the number of parameters, making the network more computationally efficient and capable of learning to recognize features regardless of their spatial location in the input image. This approach not only streamlines the learning process but also enhances the network's ability to generalize from visual data, making CNNs a powerful tool for image and video analysis."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user asked about the principles of convolution in neural networks and referenced several figures from a paper.

For an image from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is 32x32 pixels in size and has 3 color channels (RGB), connecting each pixel to just one neuron would require 32x32x3 weight connections. This approach scales poorly as more neurons are added; adding just one more neuron doubles the number of required connections, making the model computationally expensive and hard to train due to the vast number of parameters.\n\nConvolution simplifies this by taking a different approach. Instead of connecting each input pixel to every neuron, it applies a filter (or kernel) that focuses on local regions of the input image. Imagine, for instance, using a 5x5x3 filter that slides over the input image. This filter only connects to a local 5x5 patch of pixels (covering all 3 color channels) at any given position. If we aim to preserve the image size to 32x32 in the output layer, this sliding window approach dramatically reduces the number of connections. While a fully connected approach might require millions of connections, convolution reduces this to just the number of parameters in the filter (in this case, 5x5x3 = 75), making the model much more manageable and computationally efficient.\n\nAdditionally, a critical aspect of convolution is the concept of weight sharing. Instead of having a unique set of weights for every position of the filter, the same set of 75 weights is used across the entire image. This not only reduces the number of parameters dramatically but also allows the network to learn to recognize features (like edges) regardless of where they appear in the image, since the same filter is applied across the whole input.\n\nMoreover, by stacking multiple convolutional layers each equipped with different filters, a CNN can extract a hierarchy of features.

Let's break down this principle using the context and math from the provided discussion, and without directly copying the sentences.\n\nImagine we have an input, such as a color image from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is 32x32 pixels in size and has 3 color channels (RGB). If this input were to be connected fully to just one neuron in the next layer, we'd need a staggering 32x32x3 (or 3,072) weight connections. This number multiplies further with the addition of more neurons, leading to an explosion in the number of parameters (e.g., two neurons would require over 6,000 connections).\n\nThe concept of convolution emerges as a solution to this problem by proposing a different approach: instead of considering the entire image at once, why not focus on local regions of the image? By doing so, we drastically reduce the number of connections. For example, considering a 5x5 local region (filter) across the 3 color channels reduces the connections from millions to just 76,800 when this local region is connected to a 32x32 output layer. This is the essence captured in hypothetical Figure 3.\n\nBut it gets even more efficient. By applying the same 5x5x3 filter (or kernel) across the entire input image\u2014sliding it across to cover all possible positions\u2014we not only simplify the weight matrix further but also enable the network to detect features (like edges) regardless of where they are in the image. This universal application of the filter across the entire image requires only 75 unique weight parameters since the same 5x5x3 filter is reused for every position on the input image. This process represents the core of what convolution is about.\n\nHypothetical Figure 4 could show, for instance, how selecting specific weights within a 3x3 filter can enable the detection of edges in different orientations. These convolutional filters act by highlighting certain features while diminishing others, much like traditional filters in image processing. However, unlike traditional filters, the weights in a convolutional neural network's filters are learned during training, allowing the network to adaptively focus on features that are most informative for the task at hand.\n\nAs we add more layers to the network, each with its filters (as illustrated in a hypothetical Figure 5), we enable the model to extract and compile increasingly complex features from the input image. Early layers might detect simple edges or textures, while deeper layers may interpret these features to discern more complex patterns or objects within the image.

Let\u2019s assume that the network receives raw pixels as input. Therefore, to connect the input layer to only one neuron (e.g. in the hidden layer in the Multi- Layer perceptron), as an example, there should be 32\u00d732\u00d73 weight connections for the CIFAR-10 dataset.\n\nIf we add one more neuron into the hidden layer, then we will need another 32\u00d732\u00d73 weight connection, which will become in total, 32\u00d732\u00d73\u00d72 parameters. To make it clearer, more than 6000 weight parameters are used to connect the input to just only two nodes. It may be thought that two neurons might not be enough for any useful processing for an image classification application. To make it more efficient, we can connect the input image to the neurons in the next layer with exactly the same values for the height and width.

Therefore, it again drops many extra parameters, and reduces the number of weights to only 5\u00d75\u00d73=75 to connect 32\u00d732\u00d73 neurons to 32\u00d732 in the next layer [5], [8], [11].\n\nThere are many benefits to these simple assumptions. Firstly, the number of connections decrease from around 3 million to only 75 connections in the presented example. Secondly, and a more interesting concept, is that fixing the weights for the local connections is similar to sliding a window of 5\u00d75\u00d73 in the input neurons and mapping the generated output to the corresponding place. It provides an opportunity to detect and recognize features regardless of their positions in the image.

This method significantly reduces the computational complexity and the number of parameters that need to be learned during training. Let's break down the concept using the information provided but rephrase it for clarity.\n\nImagine we have an image from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is a color image with a resolution of 32x32 pixels, and it contains 3 color channels (Red, Green, and Blue - RGB). This gives our input a three-dimensional shape, with its width and height being 32x32 and its depth being 3 due to the color channels.\n\nTraditionally, if we were to connect this input to a neuron in a fully connected manner (like in a Multi-Layer Perceptron), each neuron in the next layer would require a direct connection to every single input pixel across all color channels. For just two neurons, this results in a whopping 6,144 parameters (32x32x3x2), which is highly inefficient, especially considering that real-world applications would require substantially more neurons for any meaningful image processing.\n\nTo address this inefficiency, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use a technique called 'convolution.' Unlike a fully connected network that considers the whole image at once, a convolution operation focuses on small, local regions of the image. This is exemplified in an approach where, instead of connecting each neuron to the entire image, we only connect it to a small, localized region of the input (for instance, a 5x5 area of pixels) and use the same \"filter\" or set of weights across the entire image. This significantly reduces the number of connections and parameters. Instead of needing millions of parameters, we only need a handful (in the example given, 5x5x3=75), as these weights are shared across all local regions of the input image.\n\nThis reduction in parameters serves multiple purposes:\n1. It drastically lowers the computational cost and the memory requirements, making the training of neural networks more feasible.\n2. It allows the network to learn general features (like edges, textures, etc.) that are relevant regardless of where they appear in the image. That is, the network becomes better at identifying features irrespective of their position due to the \"sliding window\" approach of the convolution operation.\n\nFurther illustrating the concept, consider a 3x3 window (or filter) sliding across the entire input image. Depending on the weights of this filter, it can be tuned to detect specific features like edges. These filters are initially set randomly but are refined through training to better suit the task at hand, such as recognizing shapes, textures, or objects within the image.\n\nAdding multiple layers, each with its filters, allows for the extraction of increasingly abstract features from the input image. The first layer might detect simple edges, while subsequent layers might recognize more complex patterns or objects, all by looking at the same region of the input but through different \"lenses\" provided by these filters.\n\nIn essence, convolution in neural networks provides a powerful way to reduce the complexity of image analysis, enabling the efficient learning of features that are crucial for tasks like image classification, while also allowing the network to scale in depth with different layers focusing on increasingly complex features."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user asked about the principle of convolution in neural networks, referencing several figures from a paper.

To delve into this concept, let's discuss the mechanics and benefits as illustrated across the referenced figures in the cited paper.\n\n### Basic Concept and Necessity for Convolution (Referencing Fig. 2)\n\nImagine a neural network tasked with analyzing a color image from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is 32 pixels wide and 32 pixels high, and has 3 color channels (RGB). Treating this image as a raw input, if we were to use a fully connected network, connecting the input layer to just one neuron in the next layer would require 32 x 32 x 3, which equals 3,072 weight connections. For just two neurons, this number doubles, highlighting an inefficient approach due to the explosion of parameters needed as we add more neurons for more nuanced processing.\n\n### The Shift to Convolution (Referencing Fig. 3)\n\nTo address this inefficiency, the concept of convolution introduces the idea of connecting neurons to only local regions of the input layer instead of every single neuron. For example, connecting to a 5x5 patch of pixels for each section of the image drastically reduces the number of weight connections needed. If every neuron in the next layer looks at only a 5x5x3 (height x width x depth) patch, for an entire layer of 32x32 neurons, we reduce the connections to 76,800, which is substantially fewer than the connections required in a fully connected approach.\n\n### Simplification Through Weight Sharing (No specific figure reference but elaborates on the transition from the high-parameter model)\n\nA further reduction in complexity is achieved by applying the same weights across these local connections, meaning the same 5x5x3 filter is slid across the entire input image, connecting to all patches in the same way. This move reduces the number of unique weights down to just 75. This approach not only curtails the number of parameters drastically but also enables the network to recognize patterns (like edges) irrespective of their position in the input image due to this uniform application of weights across the input field.\n\n### Convolutional Filters' Impact (Referencing Fig. 4)\n\nFigure 4 would likely showcase how by manually tweaking the weights in a 3x3 convolutional filter, it's possible to create a filter that specifically detects edges in the input image. This illustrates the core functionality of convolutional filters - to extract specific features from the input, such as edges, corners, or more complex patterns in deeper layers.\n\n### Building Complexity with Multiple Filters and Layers (Referencing Fig. 5)\n\nFinally, to extract various features and build a complex understanding of the image, multiple layers, each with different filters, can be stacked. Figure 5 probably illustrates how each subsequent layer looks at the same region of the input image but through different filters, capturing different aspects of the image's information. This process allows the CNN to dissect and understand images in a hierarchical fashion, from simple patterns to complex objects.\n\nIn summary, the principle of convolution harnesses the power of localized filtering and weight sharing to efficiently process and interpret the vast data present in images. By reducing the number of parameters and focusing on local features, CNNs can effectively recognize and classify image content, leading to their widespread use in image recognition tasks."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user asked about the principle of stride in CNNs and provided a reference to a paper.

Stride\nIn fact, CNN has more options which provide a lot of opportunities to even decrease the parameters more and more, and at the same time reduce some of the side effects. One of these options is stride. In the above mentioned example, it is simply assumed that the next layer's node has lots of overlaps with their neighbors by looking at the regions. We can manipulate the overlap by controlling the stride. Fig. 6, shows a given 7\u00d77 image. If we move the filter one node every time, we can have a 5\u00d75 output only. Note that the output of the three left matrices in Fig. 6, have an overlap (and three middle ones together and three right ones also).

Here's an explanation of stride in CNNs, drawing inspiration from the information provided but rephrased for clarity:\n\nWhen a filter (or kernel) moves across an input image during the convolution operation, it does so in steps. These steps are called strides. The size of the stride determines how many pixels the filter moves each time it slides over the image. A smaller stride means the filter moves with smaller steps, leading to higher overlap between the areas processed by the filter on successive steps. Conversely, a larger stride moves the filter in bigger steps, reducing overlap and hence the size of the output.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example similar to the one in the original explanation, consider a 7x7 pixel image. If we apply a filter with a stride of 1, the filter moves one pixel at a time. This results in a relatively smaller reduction in the output size, producing, for instance, a 5x5 output, depending on the specific dimensions of the filter used. This case has high overlap between the regions processed on successive steps, as the filter covers almost the entire area of the image in small increments.\n\nOn the other hand, if we increase the stride to 2, the filter skips one pixel every time it moves. This approach greatly reduces the overlap between the processed regions and also decreases the output size more significantly, potentially producing a 3x3 output from the same 7x7 input image. This is because the larger step size means the filter covers fewer total areas of the input image.\n\nThe relationship between the dimension of the input image (N), the size of the filter (F), the stride size (S), and the resulting output size (O) can be mathematically represented as follows:\n\nO = 1 + (N - F) / S\n\nThis formula helps in determining the size of the output feature map, taking into account the input size, the filter size, and the stride, offering a systematic way to calculate the impact of stride on the output dimensions of the convolution operation. \n\nUnderstanding and manipulating stride is essential in CNN design not only for controlling the dimensionality of the output but also for reducing computational complexity and potentially limiting memory usage, which can be particularly valuable in designing efficient models for resource-constrained environments."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user asked about the convolution formula in CNNs and sought a detailed explanation.

In simpler terms, it's describing the process of applying a filter (or kernel) to an input image to produce an output feature map. Let's break it down into more understandable parts.\n  \n1. **Convolution Operation (***):** This is a mathematical operation used in CNNs to extract features from input data. It involves a filter or kernel, which is essentially a small matrix of weights. This filter is slid (convolved) over the input image (or the previous layer's feature map) to produce a transformed version of the input. This process helps in capturing spatial dependencies in the image such as edges, textures, or patterns depending on the filter.\n\n2. **Input Image (x):** This is the data that the CNN processes. Initially, it is the actual image you want the network to learn from, represented in a numerical form (a matrix of pixel values). In deeper layers, the input would be the output feature maps from the previous layers.\n\n3. **Kernel or Filter Matrix (w):** This is a predefined or learned matrix that decides how to transform the input data. The kernel moves over the input image, and at every position, it applies a convolution operation. The kernel has its own small set of weights, which are optimized during the training process to capture specific features at higher efficiencies.\n\n4. **Output in the Next Layer ():** After applying the convolution operation across the entire input image (or preceding layer's output), the result is a new feature map. This feature map represents a transformed version of the input, highlighting or suppressing specific features according to the kernel's design.\n\n5. **How the Convolution Works:** For any given point (pixel) on the output feature map, its value is determined by overlaying the kernel on the input image (or preceding layer's feature map) such that the corresponding pixel is at the center of the kernel. Each element of the kernel is then multiplied by the value of the input element it covers, and all these products are summed up to give a single number. This sum forms one element of the output feature map.\n\nIn essence, the convolutional layer acts as a feature detector, mapping specific features from the input to the output through a combination of weighted sums determined by the overlay of the kernel on the input. These features become more complex and abstract as you go deeper into the network, enabling it to learn intricate patterns in the data."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Show  the formula"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly!

When summed over a large number of easy examples, these small loss values can overwhelm the rare class.\n\n3.1 Balanced Cross Entropy\nA common method for addressing class imbalance is to introduce a weighting factor \u03b1\u2208[0,1] for class 1 and 1\u2212\u03b1 for class \u22121. In practice \u03b1 may be set by inverse class frequency or treated as a hyperparameter to set by cross validation. For notational convenience, we define \u03b1t analogously to how we defined pt.

Easily classified negatives comprise the majority of the loss and dominate the gradient. While \u03b1 balances the importance of positive/negative examples, it does not differentiate between easy/hard examples.

As pt\u21921, the factor goes to 0 and the loss for well-classified examples is down-weighted. (2) The focusing parameter \u03b3 smoothly adjusts the rate at which easy examples are down-weighted. When \u03b3=0, FL is equivalent to CE, and as \u03b3 is increased the effect of the modulating factor is likewise increased (we found \u03b3=2 to work best in our experiments).\n\nIntuitively, the modulating factor reduces the loss contribution from easy examples and extends the range in which an example receives low loss. For instance, with \u03b3=2, an example classified with pt=0.9 would have 100\u00d7 lower loss compared with CE and with pt\u22480.968 it would have 1000\u00d7 lower loss. This in turn increases the importance of correcting misclassified examples (whose loss is scaled down by at most 4\u00d7 for pt\u2264.5 and \u03b3=2).\n\nIn practice we use an \u03b1-balanced variant of the focal loss:\nFL(pt)=\u2212\u03b1t(1\u2212pt)\u03b3log(pt).(5)\nView SourceRight-click on figure for MathML and additional features.We adopt this form in our experiments as it yields slightly improved accuracy over the non-\u03b1-balanced form. Finally, we note that the implementation of the loss layer combines the sigmoid operation for computing p with the loss computation, resulting in greater numerical stability.\n\nWhile in our main experimental results we use the focal loss definition above, its precise form is not crucial. In Section 3.5 we consider other instantiations of the focal loss and demonstrate that these can be equally effective.\n\n3.3 Class Imbalance and Model Initialization\nBinary classification models are by default initialized to have equal probability of outputting either y=\u22121 or 1. Under such an initialization, in the presence of class imbalance, the loss due to the frequent class can dominate total loss and cause instability in early training. To counter this, we introduce the concept of a \u2018prior\u2019 for the value of p estimated by the model for the rare class (foreground) at the start of training. We denote the prior by \u03c0 and set it so that the model\u2019s estimated p for examples of the rare class is low, e.g., 0.01. We note that this is a change in model initialization (see Section 4.1) and not of the loss function. We found this to improve training stability for both the cross entropy and focal loss in the case of heavy class imbalance.\u201d\nFrom the above paper, summarize how focal loss for tackling the imbalanced dataset problem in deep learning and its advantages. Try to use your own words, do not copy the sentences directly from the above paper."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Focal loss is a strategic approach designed to tackle the challenge of extreme class imbalance often encountered in one-stage object detection tasks, where the number of background instances (negatives) vastly outnumbers the foreground instances (positives). Traditional methods such as cross entropy loss struggle in these scenarios because the aggregation of small loss values from the easily classified majority class can overshadow the minority class, potentially leading to biased models that favor the majority class.\n\nTo address this, focal loss introduces a critical modification to the cross-entropy loss by incorporating a modulating factor, \\((1-p_t)^\\gamma\\), where \\(p_t\\) is the model's estimated probability for the correct class, and \\(\\gamma\\) is a tunable parameter that controls the focus on hard examples - those incorrectly classified or with high uncertainty. This modulating factor aims to scale down the loss associated with easy-to-classify examples (where \\(p_t\\) is high), thereby reducing their influence on the model training process. The parameter \\(\\gamma\\) regulates how quickly the influence of these easy examples is diminished; a \\(\\gamma\\) of 0 makes the focal loss equivalent to the standard cross-entropy loss, while higher values increase the focus on hard, misclassified examples.\n\nFocal loss also incorporates a technique for addressing class imbalance more directly through the use of an \\(\\alpha\\)-balanced variant. This involves weighting the loss of the positive and negative classes differently, where \\(\\alpha\\) is a coefficient for the positive class and \\(1-\\alpha\\) for the negative, potentially set based on the inverse frequency of the classes or determined via cross-validation. This \\(\\alpha\\)-balanced focal loss further helps in minimizing the dominance of the majority class in the loss computation by adjusting the importance given to each class.\n\nAn intuitive benefit of focal loss is its ability to automatically adjust the training focus towards hard-to-classify examples, thus potentially reducing the model's bias towards the majority class and enhancing its capability to recognize minority class instances, which are often of greater interest in tasks like object detection. By significantly lowering the loss contribution from easy negatives, the model is encouraged to correct its mistakes on harder examples, which leads to better overall performance.\n\nLastly, to assist with the initial training phase under extreme class imbalance, the concept of initializing the model with a low estimated probability (\\(\\pi\\)) for the rare class is suggested. This approach ensures that the loss contribution from the common class does not overwhelm the model from the outset, promoting training stability.\n\nIn summary, focal loss is a sophisticated solution designed specifically for dealing with the challenges of class imbalance in deep learning models, especially for object detection tasks. By dynamically adjusting the emphasis on hard negatives and effectively managing class imbalance, it facilitates more balanced training and improved model performance on minority class instances."}]}]}, {"summary": "The user asked about CNN principles, including convolution, stride, and pooling, with references to figures and equations.

To make it clearer, more than 6000 weight parameters are used to connect the input to just only two nodes. It may be thought that two neurons might not be enough for any useful processing for an image classification application. To make it more efficient, we can connect the input image to the neurons in the next layer with exactly the same values for the height and width. It can be assumed this network is applied for the type of processing such as the edge in the image. However, the mentioned network needs 32\u00d732\u00d73 by 32\u00d732 weight connections, which are (3,145,728), as in [4,5,14]. Therefore, looking for a more efficient method, it emerged that instead of a full connection, it is a good idea to look for local regions in the picture instead of in the whole image. Fig. 3, shows a regional connection for the next layer. In other words, the hidden neurons in the next layer only get inputs from the corresponding part of the previous layer. For example, it can only be connected to 5\u00d75 neurons. Thus, if we want to have 32\u00d732 neurons in the next layer, then we will have 5\u00d75\u00d73 by 32x32 connections which is 76,800 connections (compared to 3,145,728 for full connectivity), as in [1,9,13,14,17]. Although the size of connection drastically dropped, it still leaves so many parameters to solve. Another assumption for simplification, is to keep the local connection weights fixed for the entire neurons of the next layer. This will connect the neighbor neurons in the next layer with exactly the same weight to the local region of the previous layer. Therefore, it again drops many extra parameters, and reduces the number of weights to only 5\u00d75\u00d73=75 to connect 32\u00d732\u00d73 neurons to 32\u00d732 in the next layer [5,8,11]. There are many benefits to these simple assumptions. Firstly, the number of connections decrease from around 3 million to only 75 connections in the presented example. Secondly, and a more interesting concept, is that fixing the weights for the local connections is similar to sliding a window of 5\u00d75\u00d73 in the input neurons and mapping the generated output to the corresponding place. It provides an opportunity to detect and recognize features regardless of their positions in the image. This is the reason why they are called convolutions [6,7,16]. Fig. 3.

Let's break down the concept step by step, infusing it with some basic mathematical understanding and referring to the context provided previously.\n\n### Understanding the Problem with Fully Connected Networks\n\nImagine you have an image from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is 32x32 pixels in size and has three color channels (RGB). A fully connected neural network would require connecting each input pixel to neurons in the next layer, leading to a massive number of parameters. For instance, connecting this input to just two neurons in the next layer would need \\(32 \\times 32 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 6,144\\) weights. As you add more neurons for deeper learning, the number of required connections (and thus weights) balloons exponentially, making the network computationally expensive and prone to overfitting.\n\n### Introduction to Convolution\n\nTo address these inefficiencies, the convolution operation introduces two critical changes:\n\n1. **Local Receptive Fields:** Rather than connecting every input pixel to every neuron, each neuron in the first hidden layer 'looks' at a small, local region of the input image (e.g., a 5x5 area of pixels). This dramatically reduces the number of connections. For a network aiming to have an output size of 32x32 with each neuron looking at a 5x5 patch, we reduce the connections to \\(5 \\times 5 \\times 3 \\times 32 \\times 32 = 76,800\\), which is significantly less than a fully connected approach.\n\n2. **Parameter Sharing:** Instead of learning a unique set of weights for every location in the input image, the same set of weights (or kernel) is used across all locations. This means for any given filter (looking at a 5x5x3 patch), we only learn 75 weights (\\(5 \\times 5 \\times 3\\)) that are applied across the entire input image. This drastically reduces the number of parameters from thousands (or millions in larger networks) to just 75 for connecting a layer looking at 32x32x3 inputs to a 32x32 neuron output layer.\n\n### The Convolution Operation\n\nMathematically, convolution involves sliding this kernel (a small matrix of weights) across the input image. At each location, a dot product is computed between the kernel weights and the values of the input pixels it covers. This operation is repeated across the entire image, producing an output feature map that highlights features detected by the kernel, such as edges or textures.\n\n### Feature Hierarchy with Multiple Layers\n\nBy stacking multiple convolution layers, each with its own set of learnable filters, CNNs are capable of extracting progressively higher-level features from raw input. The first layer might learn to detect simple edges, while deeper layers might combine these edges to detect shapes, and even deeper layers could identify objects.\n\nThis hierarchical feature extraction process allows CNNs to efficiently process high-dimensional inputs and has made them the go-to architecture for tasks like image and video recognition, where understanding spatial hierarchies is crucial.\n\n### Visual Understanding\n\nImagine you have a filter designed to detect vertical edges in an image. As you slide this filter across the image, the areas of the image that closely resemble vertical edges will produce a high response in the output feature map, while areas that do not will produce a low response. This operation is replicated across the network with various filters designed to capture different aspects of the image's content.\n\nIn summary, convolution leverages the spatial hierarchy of features in images, significantly reducing the number of parameters through local receptive fields and weight sharing, thereby enabling the efficient processing of images and forming the basis of Convolutional Neural Networks."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user asked about the principle of convolution in neural networks, including detailed explanations and references to figures.

For example, a CIFAR-10 dataset image with a size of 32\u00d732 pixels and 3 color channels (RGB) would require 32\u00d732\u00d73 weight connections for just a single neuron. If you had two neurons, this number would double, resulting in over 6000 parameters for just two neurons, which is grossly inefficient for processing images.\n\nFigures referenced suggest a paradigm shift towards utilizing the structure and locality within images. By exploiting the spatial correlation, convolution layers connect neurons only to local regions (receptive fields) instead of the entire image, significantly reducing the number of required parameters.\n\nFor example, consider having a filter (or kernel) size of 5\u00d75 with depth 3 to match the input depth. Instead of connecting each pixel to every neuron in the next layer, you only connect pixels within localized 5\u00d75 regions. If the output layer also has dimensions of 32\u00d732, applying this localized connection pattern results in 5\u00d75\u00d73 by 32\u00d732 connections, diminishing the total number from millions to 76,800 connections.\n\nMoreover, by employing the same weights (or filter) across the entire image (a key convolution operation), the number of unique weight parameters further reduces to just the size of the filter (in this case, 5\u00d75\u00d73 = 75). This sliding window mechanism of convolutions not only drastically cuts down on the number of parameters but also allows the network to detect features (like edges) regardless of their spatial location in the input image.\n\nThe visual representation of this, as suggested, is that certain convolution filters can highlight features such as edges, thus illustrating the convolution operation's capability to extract meaningful patterns or features from the input image. Following layers can use different filters to extract other features, layering complexity and depth to the learned representations.\n\nSubsequent figures would illustrate how different layers in a convolutional neural network (CNN) can have different filters, each extracting unique features from the input. These stacked filters allow CNNs to learn multi-level representations of the input data, from simple edges to more complex patterns, contributing to their power in tasks like image recognition.\n\nIn essence, convolution operations provide a highly efficient, scalable way to process and learn from image data. They reduce computational complexity by focusing on local connections and shared weights, thus allowing networks to learn invariant features across spatial locations, making them particularly suited for image and video recognition tasks."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user asked about the principle of convolution in neural networks, referencing figures and providing detailed context.

This explanation will unpack the principles of convolution as summarized from the provided paper while incorporating mathematical insights and references to the aforementioned figures.\n\nAt its most basic, the concept of convolution is introduced as a response to the inefficiencies found in fully connected networks, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data like images (Fig. 2). In the context of a color image from the CIFAR-10 dataset (32x32 pixels in size with 3 color channels - RGB), directly connecting each input pixel to just one neuron in a hidden layer requires an enormous number of weight connections (32\u00d732\u00d73 for each neuron). This setup scales poorly as more neurons are added, leading to a drastic increase in the number of parameters (for two neurons, a total of 32\u00d732\u00d73\u00d72 parameters).\n\nTo address this, convolution proposes focusing on local regions of the input instead of establishing connections with the entire input space (Fig. 3). This approach significantly reduces the number of connections by ensuring neurons in the next layer only connect to a small, localized region of the input (a 5x5 region for instance). If this method is applied to maintain the same output dimensionality (32x32 in our example), it results in a much more manageable total of 5\u00d75\u00d73\u00d732\u00d732 connections, dramatically less than a fully connected setup.\n\nThe reduction of parameters is further optimized by sharing weights across these local connections. Instead of having a unique set of weights for each connection, all neurons in a layer share the same weights (a 5\u00d75\u00d73 filter), reducing the number of parameters down to just 75. This strategy not only massively simplifies the model but also enables the detection of features regardless of their spatial location in the input, a property illustrated by sliding a window (the filter) across all regions of the input (Fig. 4).\n\nThis sliding window approach allows for the extraction of features such as edges through the use of convolution matrices or filters, which can be manually set or learned during training. These filters can detect specific types of features at the initial layers (edges, corners, etc.) and more complex patterns in deeper layers.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, CNNs can stack multiple such convolutional layers, each equipped with its own set of filters, to extract a hierarchy of features from the input data (Fig. 5). Each subsequent layer captures more abstract and complex representations, allowing the network to understand the input data in a comprehensive and layered manner.\n\nIn summary, the convolution operation revolutionizes how neural networks process high-dimensional data by focusing on local connectivity, weight sharing, and feature hierarchy. This approach significantly reduces the computational cost while enhancing the network's ability to learn and recognize patterns across different spatial regions of the input data."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user asked about the principle of convolution in neural networks, referencing figures and detailed explanations.

Convolution\nLet\u2019s assume that the input of our neural network has the presented shape in Fig. 2, It can be an image (e.g. color image of a CIFAR-10 dataset with a width and height of 32\u00d732 pixels, and a depth of 3 which RGB channel) or a video (gray scale video whose height and width are the resolution, and the depth are the frames) or even an experimental video, which has width and height of (L\u00d7L) sensor values, and the depths are associated with different time frames, as in [2], [10], [15].\n\nFig. 2. - Three dimensional input representation of cnn\nFig. 2.\nThree dimensional input representation of cnn\n\nShow All\n\nWhy convolution ?. Let\u2019s assume that the network receives raw pixels as input. Therefore, to connect the input layer to only one neuron (e.g. in the hidden layer in the Multi- Layer perceptron), as an example, there should be 32\u00d732\u00d73 weight connections for the CIFAR-10 dataset.\n\nIf we add one more neuron into the hidden layer, then we will need another 32\u00d732\u00d73 weight connection, which will become in total, 32\u00d732\u00d73\u00d72 parameters. To make it clearer, more than 6000 weight parameters are used to connect the input to just only two nodes. It may be thought that two neurons might not be enough for any useful processing for an image classification application. To make it more efficient, we can connect the input image to the neurons in the next layer with exactly the same values for the height and width. It can be assumed this network is applied for the type of processing such as the edge in the image. However, the mentioned network needs 32\u00d732\u00d73 by 32\u00d732 weight connections, which are (3,145,728), as in [4,5,14].\n\nTherefore, looking for a more efficient method, it emerged that instead of a full connection, it is a good idea to look for local regions in the picture instead of in the whole image. Fig. 3, shows a regional connection for the next layer. In other words, the hidden neurons in the next layer only get inputs from the corresponding part of the previous layer. For example, it can only be connected to 5\u00d75 neurons. Thus, if we want to have 32\u00d732 neurons in the next layer, then we will have 5\u00d75\u00d73 by 32\u00d732 connections which is 76,800 connections (compared to 3,145,728 for full connectivity), as in [1,9,13,14,17].\n\nFig. 3. - Convolution as alternative for fully connected network.\nFig. 3.\nConvolution as alternative for fully connected network.\n\nShow All\n\nAlthough the size of connection drastically dropped, it still leaves so many parameters to solve. Another assumption for simplification, is to keep the local connection weights fixed for the entire neurons of the next layer. This will connect the neighbor neurons in the next layer with exactly the same weight to the local region of the previous layer. Therefore, it again drops many extra parameters, and reduces the number of weights to only 5\u00d75\u00d73=75 to connect 32\u00d732\u00d73 neurons to 32\u00d732 in the next layer [5], [8], [11].\n\nThere are many benefits to these simple assumptions. Firstly, the number of connections decrease from around 3 million to only 75 connections in the presented example. Secondly, and a more interesting concept, is that fixing the weights for the local connections is similar to sliding a window of 5\u00d75\u00d73 in the input neurons and mapping the generated output to the corresponding place. It provides an opportunity to detect and recognize features regardless of their positions in the image. This is the reason why they are called convolutions [6,7,16].\n\nTo show the astounding effect of the convolution matrix, Fig.4, depicts what will happen if we manually pick the connection weight in a 3\u00d73 window.\n\nAs we can see Fig. 4, the matrix can be set to detect edges in the image. These matrices are also called a filter because they act like the classic filters in the image processing. However, in the convolutional neural network these filters are initialized, followed by the training procedure shape filters, which are more suitable for the given task.\n\nFig. 4. - Effects of different convolutio matrix.\nFig. 4.\nEffects of different convolutio matrix.\n\nShow All\n\nTo make this method more beneficial, it is possible to add more layers after the input layer. Each layer can be associated with different filters. Therefore, we can extract different features from the given image. Fig. 5, shows how they are connected to the different layers. Each layer has its own filter and therefore extracts different features from the input. The neurons shown in Fig. 5, use a different filter, but look at the same part of the input image.

This explanation is derived and adapted from the conceptual framework presented in the excerpt, incorporating the mathematical underpinnings provided.\n\n### Simplified Background\n\nWhen dealing with visual data \u2014 such as a 32x32 pixel color image from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which has 3 color channels (RGB) \u2014 employing a fully connected network approach would necessitate a significant number of parameters. For a single neuron in a hidden layer, the connections would equate to 32x32x3 (3072) weights. Adding another neuron doubles this requirement, highlighting scalability issues as the network expands.\n\n### The Shift Towards Convolution\n\nThe key innovation with CNNs lies in their strategic reduction of the parameters involved through the use of convolution operations. Instead of fully connecting every input pixel to the hidden layers, CNNs employ a localized receptive field strategy. \n\n1. **Localized Receptive Fields**: Rather than looking at the entire image, each neuron in a certain layer looks at only a small, localized area of the input image (e.g., a 5x5 region). If we wanted to create a layer looking at 32x32 regions of the input, with a depth considering 3 color channels, this initially implies 5x5x3 filters applied to each of the 32x32 image segments. This approach reduces the parameters significantly, to 76,800 connections when compared to the millions required for full connectivity.\n\n2. **Weight Sharing**: Simplification occurs further when these local connection weights are kept constant across the entire layer. This means all neurons in a layer share the same weight for their respective localized region of the input, slashing the number of unique weights to just 75 (5x5x3) to connect across a transformation. This method drastically lowers complexity, from millions of parameters to just a few dozens.\n\n3. **Feature Detection and Position Invariance**: An attractive byproduct of this approach is the inherent ability of CNNs to detect features (like edges) across different positions in the input image. This is due to the sliding window mechanism of the convolution operation, which allows the network to learn filter weights that best capture the salient features necessary for tasks like image classification, regardless of where those features occur in the input space.\n\n4. **Layering and Feature Hierarchy**: Adding multiple convolutional layers, each with distinct filters, allows the network to extract a rich hierarchy of features from the input image. Early layers might detect simple features like edges or corners, while deeper layers can interpret complex patterns by combining the simpler features detected by earlier layers. This stratification allows CNNs to perform well in extracting spatial hierarchies in visual data.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe convolution operation in CNNs revolutionizes how networks understand images, employing a combination of local receptive fields, weight sharing, and layered feature extraction to effectively reduce computational complexity while simultaneously enhancing feature detection capabilities. Through this, CNNs can efficiently process and understand vast amounts of visual data with significantly reduced parameters, leading to more scalable and effective neural network designs for image and video analysis tasks."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user asked about the principle of stride in CNNs, referencing a paper and figures.

Stride plays a crucial role in controlling the dimensionality of the output feature map and the overlap between the regions analyzed by consecutive positions of the filter.\n\nImagine we have a filter that we apply to a 7x7 pixel image. If we set the stride to 1, this means the filter moves one pixel at a time as it scans across the image. By moving the filter one pixel at a time, adjacent applications of the filter will have a high degree of overlap, and the resulting output will have a relatively high resolution, for a 7x7 image using a suitable filter size (e.g., 3x3), this translates into a 5x5 output, assuming we're not padding the image. This high-resolution output ensures detailed feature detection but at the cost of computational complexity and increased parameter count.\n\nHowever, when we increase the stride to 2, the filter jumps two pixels at a time. This reduces overlap between consecutive filter applications, leading to a larger field of view being covered with each move. Consequently, for the same 7x7 image, the output feature map's dimensions are reduced, resulting in a 3x3 output when using the same filter size. This reduction in output size decreases the computational load and the number of parameters necessary for the model, enhancing efficiency. Yet, it may also decrease the granularity of the detected features since finer details may be skipped over due to the larger strides.\n\nThe relationship between the input size (N), the filter size (F), the stride size (S), and the output size (O) can be described mathematically. If we denote the size of the input image as N\u00d7N, the size of the filter as F\u00d7F, and the stride as S, the size of the resulting output O can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ O = 1 + \\frac{N - F}{S} \\]\n\nThis equation encapsulates how changing the stride affects the spatial dimensions of the output feature map. A larger stride results in a smaller output dimension, reducing computation and model size but potentially missing some finer details in the image. Conversely, a smaller stride increases the resolution of the output, capturing more detail but at the expense of increased computational cost.\n\nIn summary, stride in CNNs is a powerful tool for managing the trade-off between computational efficiency and the granularity of feature detection. By adjusting stride, model designers can optimize CNN architectures for various constraints, such as computational resources, model size, and the necessity to capture fine-grained details in the input images."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user asked about the principle of stride in CNNs, referencing specific figures and equations.

When a filter traverses the input image, it can move one pixel at a time, which is considered a stride of 1, or it can jump over pixels, taking larger steps, which is where different stride values come into play.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example, imagine we have a 7x7 pixel image. If the convolutional filter moves across the image one pixel at a time (a stride of 1), and considering the dimensions of the filter itself, the resulting output would potentially be a 5x5 pixel feature map. This scenario implies that there's considerable overlap among the regions of the input image processed by the filter in successive steps, as it captures the neighboring regions closely.\n\nHowever, if we adjust the stride to a value of 2, meaning the filter jumps two pixels at a time instead of just one, the overlap between the regions processed in successive steps decreases. This not only reduces the overlap but also results in a smaller output feature map, in this case, a 3x3 pixel feature map. This demonstrates how manipulating the stride affects both the dimensionality of the output and the extent of overlap between the regions of the input image examined by the filter.\n\nThe relationship between the size of the input image (N), the dimension of the filter (F), the stride (S), and the size of the output feature map (O) can be mathematically represented as follows:\n\n\\[ O = 1 + \\frac{(N - F)}{S} \\]\n\nThis equation abstractly captures how the dimensions of the output feature map are influenced by the size of the input image, the filter, and the stride length.

Imagine dividing an image into several 2x2 subregions or rectangles. For each of these sections, max-pooling identifies and retains only the highest value present, effectively reducing the overall size of the data. Typically, a 2x2 filter size is employed with a stride of 2. Stride refers to how far the pooling operation moves across the image. With a stride of 2, after processing a 2x2 section, the operation jumps two pixels over to start on a new section, which prevents the pooling domains from overlapping and results in down-sampling.\n\nHowever, if preserving detailed spatial information is crucial, using a stride of 1 might prevent down-sampling, though this approach is less common due to its minimal reduction in complexity.\n\nThe process of down-sampling through pooling could potentially lose some positional data since it prioritizes the presence of features over their exact locations. Despite this, adjusting the sizes of filters and strides can enhance pooling efficiency. As an example, using a 3x3 max-pooling filter with a stride of 2 creates slight overlaps between pooled areas, capturing more data while still reducing complexity.\n\nIn essence, pooling simplifies the input image data, making it less computationally intensive for the network to process, albeit at the cost of some loss in spatial detail.

Imagine you divide an image into several smaller squares, each composed of 2x2 pixels. Max-pooling works by examining each of these small squares and picking out the largest value from the four pixels within each square. This method effectively reduces the image size, as now, instead of four values for a given square, you only keep the highest one.\n\nThe common practice involves using a 2x2 pixel area for this operation with a technique known as 'stride 2'.

Therefore, each node in a fully-connected layer is directly connected to every node in both the previous and in the next layer as shown in Fig. 13, From this figure we can note that each of the nodes in the last frames in the pooling layer are connected as a vector to the first layer from the fully-connected layer. These are the most parameters used with the CNN within these layers, and take a long time in training [3], [8].\n\nThe major drawback of a fully-connected layer, is that it includes a lot of parameters that need complex computational in training examples. Therefore, we try to eliminate the number of nodes and connections. The removed nodes and connection can be satisfied by using the dropout technique. For example, LeNet and AlexNet designed a deep and wide network while keeping the computational complex constant [4,6,9].\n\nThe essence of the CNN network, which is the convolution, is when the nonlinearity and pooling layer are introduced. Most common architecture uses three of them as\n\nFig. 13. - Fully-connected layer\n\"\nFrom the above paper, summarize the explanation of Fully-connected layer in CNN with mentioning the figures mentioned above.

This is illustrated in the discussed figure (Fig. 13), which depicts the nodes from the final stage of the pooling layer being linked together as a vector to the initial layer of the fully-connected segment. These layers are characterized by having a substantial number of parameters, contributing to a considerable computational demand during the training process.\n\nOne of the primary challenges with fully-connected layers is their complexity and the extensive computational resources required due to the high number of parameters involved. To address this, strategies such as reducing the number of nodes and connections are employed, alongside techniques like dropout, which involves randomly omitting nodes and their connections during training to reduce overfitting and computational load. This approach allows for the construction of deep and wide networks, as demonstrated by well-known architectures like LeNet and AlexNet, without excessively increasing computational complexity.\n\nAdditionally, the figure under discussion underscores the transition from the pooling layers to the fully-connected layers within a CNN, highlighting this layer's role in integrating outputs from previous stages.

This embedding layer can be tuned through various variables for dimensions and other properties. This guide assumes familiarity with Python, PyTorch, and NumPy basics. Let's dive in.\n\n### Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries\n\nEnsure you have PyTorch installed. If not, you can install it via pip (`pip install torch`). We'll also need NumPy for some operations.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport numpy as np\n```\n\n### Step 2: Define the Embedding Network\n\nWe'll define a simple neural network class with an embedding layer. All significant parameters like the embedding dimension and the size of the vocabulary (total number of unique words or tokens you expect) will be tunable.\n\n```python\nclass EmbeddingNetwork(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, output_dim):\n        super(EmbeddingNetwork, self).__init__()\n        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)\n        # Example linear layer after embedding\n        self.fc = nn.Linear(embedding_dim, output_dim)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.embedding(x)\n        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)  # Flatten the tensor for the linear layer\n        x = self.fc(x)\n        return x\n```\n\n### Step 3: Initialization\n\nLet's define some variables to make our embedding layer and network tunable. You might want to obtain the `vocab_size` dynamically based on your dataset, but we'll use a fixed value for this example.\n\n```python\n# Tunable variables\nvocab_size = 1000  # Suppose we have a total of 1000 unique words/tokens\nembedding_dim = 128  # The size of each embedding vector\noutput_dim = 1  # For simplicity, let's say we're aiming for a binary output\n\n# Initialize the network\nnet = EmbeddingNetwork(vocab_size, embedding_dim, output_dim)\n```\n\n### Step 4: Example Usage\n\nTo use this embedding network, you'll need input sequences. In practice, these should be tokenized representations of your texts or sequences, each token being an index that points to an embedding in the embedding layer.\n\n```python\n# Dummy input - batch of 4 sequences of indices (simulating tokenized sentences)\ninput_indices = torch.LongTensor([[1, 2, 4, 5], [4, 3, 2, 9], [1, 2, 2, 1], [8, 7, 6, 5]])\n\n# Forward pass\noutput = net(input_indices)\nprint(output)  # Output from the network after passing through the embedding and linear layer\n```\n\n### Notes:\n\n- In a real scenario, ensure your input indices are within the range of `0` to `vocab_size - 1`.\n- Depending on your task, you might need to integrate other layers, loss functions, and a training loop.\n- This example provides a foundation. You can expand the neural network architecture based on your specific requirements."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"c:\\Users\\L14\\Documents\\Projets\\Easy-MoE\\New-MoE\\embeddings.py\", line 30, in <module>\n    output = net(input_indices)\n  File \"C:\\Users\\L14\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python310\\lib\\site-packages\\torch\\nn\\modules\\module.py\", line 1501, in _call_impl\n    return forward_call(*args, **kwargs)\n  File \"c:\\Users\\L14\\Documents\\Projets\\Easy-MoE\\New-MoE\\embeddings.py\", line 15, in forward\n    x = self.fc(x)\n  File \"C:\\Users\\L14\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python310\\lib\\site-packages\\torch\\nn\\modules\\module.py\", line 1501, in _call_impl\n    return forward_call(*args, **kwargs)\n  File \"C:\\Users\\L14\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python310\\lib\\site-packages\\torch\\nn\\modules\\linear.py\", line 114, in forward\n    return F.linear(input, self.weight, self.bias)\nRuntimeError: mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (4x512 and 128x1)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The error you're encountering happens because the shapes of the matrices you're trying to multiply in the linear layer (`nn.Linear`) are not aligned for matrix multiplication. Specifically, the error message \"mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (4x512 and 128x1)\" suggests that the output from the embedding layer, after being flattened, results in a shape of `[batch_size, 512]`, but your linear layer is expecting the input shape to be `[batch_size, 128]`.\n\n### Root of the Problem\n\nWhen you defined the linear layer in `self.fc = nn.Linear(embedding_dim, output_dim)`, it was configured to accept input vectors of size `embedding_dim` (128 in your setup) and output vectors of size `output_dim`. However, after the embedding layer and the flattening operation (via `x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)`), the actual size of each input vector to the linear layer became 512 (which is likely 4 tokens * embedding_dim, assuming `embedding_dim` of 128, and that you did not sum or average pool the embeddings).\n\n### How to Fix It\n\nYou need to calculate the correct input features for the linear layer. This calculation often depends on how you process the output of the embedding layer. If you're flattening the output directly, the number of input features to the linear layer (`nn.Linear`) should be `number_of_tokens * embedding_dim`.\n\nAdjusting the Linear Layer:\nIf your sequences are of fixed length (4 tokens in the example provided), and you wish to flatten the embedding output, you should configure the linear layer like so:\n\n```python\nself.fc = nn.Linear(4 * embedding_dim, output_dim)\n```\n\nThis adjustment aligns the matrix dimensions for multiplication, where 4 is the number of tokens per input sequence and `embedding_dim` is the dimensionality of each token's embedding.\n\n### Revised Forward Function\n\nTaking the above into consideration, your forward method should correctly flatten the embedding output to align with the expectations of the linear layer:\n\n```python\ndef forward(self, x):\n    x = self.embedding(x)\n    # Correctly flatten the tensor for the linear layer\n    x = x.view(x.size(0), -1) \n    x = self.fc(x)\n    return x\n```\n\n### Final Note\n\nBe aware of the dimensions at each layer of your network, especially when dealing with embeddings and subsequent layers that expect inputs of a specific shape. This scenario underscores the importance of correctly calculating the input feature size for linear layers following embeddings when flattening is involved."}, {"role": "user", "content": "this linear layer : self.fc = nn.Linear(4 * embedding_dim, output_dim) has something hard coded in it, we don't want that, revise this line and the embeddings class"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you're looking to make the model dynamically accommodate inputs of variable lengths without hard-coding specific dimensions, it's a bit more complicated since PyTorch layers need to know their input sizes beforehand. One common approach to handling variable-sized input sequences dynamically is to use techniques like average pooling or another pooling strategy over the embedding outputs, which can convert variable-length sequences into a fixed-size vector suitable for feeding into a fully connected (linear) layer.\n\nHere's an updated version of the `EmbeddingNetwork` class that utilizes average pooling to handle sequence inputs dynamically:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass EmbeddingNetwork(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, output_dim):\n        super(EmbeddingNetwork, self).__init__()\n        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)\n        # No need to specify the input dimension here; we'll pool the embeddings\n        self.fc = nn.Linear(embedding_dim, output_dim)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.embedding(x) # [batch_size, seq_length, embedding_dim]\n        # Apply an average pooling here to get a fixed size output regardless of seq_length\n        x = torch.mean(x, dim=1) # [batch_size, embedding_dim]\n        x = self.fc(x) # [batch_size, output_dim]\n        return x\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Embedding Layer**: It transforms token indices into embeddings. Given a batch of sentences with varying lengths, after embedding, the shape becomes `[batch_size, seq_length, embedding_dim]`.\n\n- **Average Pooling**: It averages embeddings across the `seq_length` dimension, resulting in a tensor of shape `[batch_size, embedding_dim]`. This operation effectively compresses the sequence of embeddings into a single fixed-size embedding vector per sequence in the batch, removing the dependency on `seq_length` and thus avoiding the need for hard-coded dimensions based on the sequence length.\n\n- **Linear (Fully Connected) Layer**: It takes the averaged embeddings (now a fixed size for any input) to produce the final output of shape `[batch_size, output_dim]`.\n\nThis approach allows your model to handle sequences of variable lengths without hard-coding any specific dimension related to the sequence length, providing more flexibility in processing batches of data where each item might have a different number of tokens.\n\nNote that using average pooling is just one of many strategies and might not always be the best choice depending on the specific nature of your task. Other approaches, such as sum pooling, max pooling, or more complex sequence processing layers (e.g., LSTM, GRU), might be more appropriate depending on the application."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Now define an unembedding network"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Creating an \"unembedding\" network, in which you aim to reverse the process of embedding, can be interpreted in a couple of ways depending on the context and what you precisely mean by \"unembedding\". One common scenario related to \"unembedding\" is trying to map the dense embeddings back to their original sparse discrete space (e.g., reconstructing token indices or one-hot vectors from embeddings). However, it's crucial to note that exact reversal is generally infeasible due to the lossy nature of embedding: multiple high-dimensional points (original token indices) get mapped to close points in the lower-dimensional embedding space.\n\nStill, if the objective is to approximate the inversion, such as for tasks like generating text from encoded sequences, a simple way is to use a neural network that takes embeddings as input and outputs logits over the vocabulary, which can then be interpreted as token indices through an `argmax` operation. This can be seen in models designed for tasks like text generation.\n\nBelow is a hypothetical implementation of such a network in PyTorch. It acts on fixed-size embedding representations and aims to output a distribution over possible tokens for each position in a sequence, essentially predicting which tokens are represented by the input embeddings.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\nclass UnembeddingNetwork(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, embedding_dim, vocab_size, seq_length):\n        super(UnembeddingNetwork, self).__init__()\n        # Example transformation layer: maps embeddings back to the vocabulary space\n        self.fc = nn.Linear(embedding_dim, vocab_size)\n        # Optionally more layers can be added here to increase model capacity\n        self.seq_length = seq_length\n        self.vocab_size = vocab_size\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Assuming x is of shape [batch_size, embedding_dim]\n        # Map from embedding space back to the vocabulary space for each token in the sequence\n        x = self.fc(x)  # [batch_size, vocab_size]\n        # Apply softmax to get probabilities over the vocabulary for each position in the sequence\n        x = F.softmax(x, dim=-1)\n        # Reshape if necessary, depending on how you wish to interpret the output\n        x = x.view(-1, self.seq_length, self.vocab_size)\n        return x\n\n# Parameters\nembedding_dim = 128\nvocab_size = 1000\nseq_length = 10  # For demonstration, assuming fixed sequence length\n\n# Initialize the unembedding network\nunet = UnembeddingNetwork(embedding_dim, vocab_size, seq_length)\n\n# Example input: a batch of embedding vectors\ninput_embeddings = torch.rand((5, embedding_dim))  # 5 is the batch size\n\n# Forward pass: predicting tokens (represented as distributions over the vocabulary)\noutput_distributions = unet(input_embeddings)\nprint(output_distributions.shape)  # Expected shape: [batch_size, seq_length, vocab_size]\n```\n\nThis example simplifies and generalizes the notion of \"unembedding\". It assumes that for each position in a sequence, you have an embedding vector, and you're trying to predict which token each vector represents by producing a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary for each position.

Given that the core neural network architecture (embedding, positional encoding, decoder layers, etc.) is already suitable for handling sequence data and generating predictions over a vocabulary, minimal changes are required to the model itself.\n\nHowever, for a more targeted next-word prediction setup, the dataset loading and training loop logic need adjustments to ensure that for each sequence fragment, the model aims to predict the immediate next token.\n\n### Adjusting the Dataset for Next-Word Prediction\n\nThe primary change involves how each training example is constructed. Instead of treating it as separate input and target sequences, each input sequence should be offset to create the corresponding target sequence where the target for each input token is the following token.\n\n```python\nclass NextWordPredictionDataset(Dataset):\n    def __init__(self, path, tokenizer_path, seq_len=512):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.tokenizer = Tokenizer.from_file(tokenizer_path)\n        self.seq_len = seq_len\n        self.examples = self.load_data(path)\n\n    def load_data(self, path):\n        examples = []\n        with open(path, \"r\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as f:\n            for line in f:\n                data = json.loads(line)\n                content = self.tokenize(data['content'])  # Assuming 'content' holds the text\n                # For next-word prediction, generate examples on-the-fly\n                for i in range(1, len(content)):\n                    input_sequence = content[:i]\n                    target_sequence = content[i]\n                    if len(input_sequence) < self.seq_len:\n                        examples.append((input_sequence, target_sequence))\n        return examples\n\n    def tokenize(self, text):\n        # Tokenize and return token IDs, do not pad here\n        output = self.tokenizer.encode(text).ids\n        return output\n\n    def __len__(self):\n        return len(self.examples)\n\n    def __getitem__(self, idx):\n        input_sequence, target_sequence = self.examples[idx]\n        input_padded = input_sequence + [self.tokenizer.token_to_id('<pad>')] * (self.seq_len - len(input_sequence))\n        return torch.tensor(input_padded, dtype=torch.long), torch.tensor(target_sequence, dtype=torch.long)\n```\n\n### Adjustments in Training Logic\n\nSince the target is now a single token rather than a sequence, slight modifications are required for how loss is calculated. Specifically, you don't need to view or reshape the outputs or targets as the target is already a single token ID.\n\n```python\ndef train(model, train_loader, optimizer, scheduler, num_epochs):\n    model.train()\n    for epoch in range(num_epochs):\n        total_loss = 0\n        for batch_idx, (inputs, targets) in enumerate(train_loader):\n            optimizer.zero_grad()\n            outputs = model(inputs)\n            # Adjust the view since our targets are now just the next word\n            outputs = outputs[:, -1, :]  # Consider only the last output for each sequence\n            loss = F.cross_entropy(outputs, targets)\n            loss.backward()\n            optimizer.step()\n            \n            total_loss += loss.item()\n\n            if batch_idx % 50 == 0:\n                print(f'Epoch {epoch} [{batch_idx * len(inputs)}/{len(train_loader.dataset)}] Loss: {loss.item()}')\n\n        scheduler.step()\n```\n\n### Simplified Text Generation\n\nText generation involves feeding in a start sequence and predicting the next word iteratively.

It utilizes Transformers-like features such as positional encoding and multi-head attention to process textual data, aiming for tasks like text completion or generating responses based on input text. However, specific parts of the setup could potentially be optimized or need attention to ensure everything functions correctly. Below are some recommendations and clarifications to streamline this setup for training a next-word prediction model:\n\n1. **Data Preparation**\n   - The `NextWordPredictionDataset` is correctly designed to create input-target pairs for training a next-word prediction model. This structure ensures that for any given input sequence, the model learns to predict the next word.\n\n2. **Model Structure**\n   - The model's architecture, consisting of an embedding layer, positional encoding, decoder layers, and a final linear layer, is suitable for processing sequential data and predicting the next word in a sequence.\n   - However, ensure that the dimensions fed into the model (through `embedding_dim`, `heads`, `ff_dim`, etc.) are well-suited for the complexity of the language or the dataset being used.\n\n3. **Training Process**\n   - The training function correctly zeroes out gradients, computes output, calculates loss, and updates model weights. However, the evaluation step inside the training loop is commented out \u2014 remember to include it if you want to track validation accuracy during training.\n   - Also, ensure that `targets` in your training loop matches the expected dimensionality. Since `targets` in `F.cross_entropy(outputs, targets)` expects class indices, this setup should work as is. However, be mindful if your targets are not correctly formatted.\n   \n4. **Text Generation**\n   - The text generation function (`generate_text`) appears logically structured for generating text based on an initial prompt. It's a good strategy for showcasing the model's capability in next-word prediction.\n\n5. **Custom DataLoader Issue**\n   - The `CustomDataLoader` class is not utilized in this setup. Instead, `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` is directly used with `train_dataset` and `val_dataset`. If `CustomDataLoader` was intended for custom batch handling, ensure it is correctly integrated or otherwise it can be safely removed if not needed.\n\n6. **Potential Issue with Shuffling `dataset.pairs`**\n   - The line `random.shuffle(dataset.pairs)` might throw an error because `NextWordPredictionDataset` does not have a `pairs` attribute; it uses `examples` instead. This line should either be removed or corrected to shuffle `dataset.examples` if shuffling data is necessary beyond what is done by the DataLoader.\n\n7. **Mathematical and Theoretical Considerations**\n   - Transformers and their components like multi-head attention and positional encoding are highly effective for problems in natural language processing. These components help the model understand and generate language by understanding the context and relationships between words in a sequence.\n\n8. **Implementation Details**\n   - Ensure that all necessary parts are tested to work together seamlessly. This includes dataset preparation, model initialization, the training loop, and the text generation capabilities. PyTorch's dynamic graph building allows for flexible experimentation, but it equally demands careful validation of dimensions and expected inputs/outputs across the model.\n\nAs with any deep learning model, especially those dealing with natural language, iterative experimentation with model architecture, hyperparameters, and training regimes is crucial to achieve desirable performance. Additionally, consider using pre-trained models like GPT-2 or GPT-3 for next-word prediction tasks, as they come pre-trained with extensive language understanding that might only require fine-tuning for specific applications."}, {"role": "user", "content": "can you help me automate the process"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Automating the entire process of training and generating text for a next-word prediction task involves a sequence of steps - from data preparation, model training, to inference.

This approach is often used in hyperparameter tuning or architectural search. Below is a step towards that goal using Python and PyTorch. This script assumes you have the basic setup ready, as discussed in previous inputs, and focuses on iterating over different model configurations.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Model Training and Evaluation Functions\n\nFirst, ensure you have a function to train a model and another to evaluate it. We'll slightly modify these functions to return necessary metrics for comparison later on.\n\n```python\ndef train(model, train_loader, optimizer, num_epochs=10):\n    model.train()\n    for epoch in range(num_epochs):\n        total_loss = 0\n        for batch_idx, (inputs, targets) in enumerate(train_loader):\n            inputs, targets = inputs.to(device), targets.to(device)\n            optimizer.zero_grad()\n            outputs = model(inputs)\n            outputs = outputs[:, -1, :]\n            loss = F.cross_entropy(outputs, targets)\n            loss.backward()\n            optimizer.step()\n            total_loss += loss.item()\n    return total_loss\n\ndef evaluate(model, val_loader):\n    model.eval()\n    total = 0\n    correct = 0\n    with torch.no_grad():\n        for inputs, targets in val_loader:\n            inputs, targets = inputs.to(device), targets.to(device)\n            outputs = model(inputs)\n            _, predicted = torch.max(outputs[:, -1, :], 1)\n            total += targets.size(0)\n            correct += (predicted == targets).sum().item()\n    accuracy = correct / total\n    return accuracy\n```\n\n### Step 2: Model Configuration and Training Loop Setup\n\nCreate a list or dictionary of configurations for your models. Iterate over this list to initialize, train, and evaluate each model configuration.\n\n```python\n# Model configurations - example with varying embedding_dim\nmodel_configs = [\n    {'vocab_size': vocab_size, 'embedding_dim': 24, 'num_layers': 2, 'heads': 4, 'ff_dim': 96},\n    {'vocab_size': vocab_size, 'embedding_dim': 48, 'num_layers': 3, 'heads': 6, 'ff_dim': 192},\n    # Add more configurations as needed\n]\n\nresults = []\n\nfor config in model_configs:\n    # Initialize model, optimizer, and scheduler\n    model = Decoder(**config).to(device)\n    optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.005)\n    \n    # Train and evaluate\n    train_loss = train(model, train_loader, optimizer, num_epochs=10)\n    accuracy = evaluate(model, val_loader)\n    \n    # Store results\n    results.append({'config': config, 'train_loss': train_loss, 'accuracy': accuracy})\n\n# Compare models\nbest_model = max(results, key=lambda x: x['accuracy'])\nprint(\"Best model configuration:\", best_model['config'])\nprint(\"With accuracy:\", best_model['accuracy'])\n```\n\n### Step 3: Adapt and Extend\n\n- You can extend the `model_configs` list with more diverse configurations, exploring different numbers of layers, heads, dimensions, etc.\n- Ensure to appropriately split your dataset into training and validation sets (`train_loader`, `val_loader`) for this loop to work.\n- Adjust learning rates, epoch numbers, or include learning rate schedulers as necessary.\n\n### Note:\n\nThis setup iteratively trains and evaluates each specified model configuration, allowing you to compare their performance easily.

In ensemble classification, numerous classifiers are utilized and are much precise than the different classifiers that are available in the ensemble. A simple voting plan is used at that point to decide the class name for not labeled occurrences. An effective and very simple voting pattern is majority voting [5]. In this type of voting, individual classifier within the ensemble is requested to forecast the class label and its occurrence being reflected. After the interrogation of all the classifiers, the class that gets the maximum amount of votes is given back as an ultimate conclusion of ensemble. One alternative is veto voting scheme in which one particular classifier prohibits the choice of every other classifiers [6].\n\nThree generally utilized ensemble methodologies are, in particular, bagging, stacking and boosting. It is an incremental procedure of building a classification of classifiers, wherever every classifier takes a shot at the mistakenly classified examples of the past one in the arrangement. The added class of ensemble methods is the Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging) [8]. Bagging includes constructing every classifier in the gathering utilizing an arbitrarily drawn data sample, having every classifier assigned an equivalent vote while marking unlabeled occurrences. Bagging is identified as the most robust than boosting in contradiction of model overfitting. The main representative of bagging is RF [9].\n\nExperiments conducted by Dietterich [10] to associate the three approaches and its performance for building ensembles of classifiers with C4.5, namely, bagging, boosting and randomization. If small or no amount of noise is present in the information, experiments indicated that boosting has been shown superior to randomization and bagging. Bagging and randomization proved alike performance, still, with little noise present within the data, randomization has better performance. Boosting execution appeared to disintegrate by noise. Furthermore bagging execution appeared to enhance, for which it could use the ailment to deliver more assorted classifiers.\n\n3 Random Forest\nThe random forest was first proposed by Leo Breiman from the University of California in 2001 [9]. It is composed of many basic classifiers (decision tree) which are completely independent from each other. Input a test sample to the new classifier and the class label of this sample can be decided based on the voting results from each single classification. The entire process of classification based on the random forest is shown in the Fig. 1.\n\nFig. 1.\nfigure 1\nConceptual framework of random forest classifier [3].\n\nFull size image\nThe following are the main steps in building up the random forest classifier [9]:\n\n(a)\nSet a proper value for the variable called \u201cM\u201d which is the number of elements of each feature subset.\n\n(b)\nSelect a new feature subset \n from the whole feature set at a random depending on the value of M. \n is independent from the other subset in the sequence of \n.\n\n(c)\nTraining the data set with the feature subset to create decision tree for each group of training set.

A random forest classifier is completed.\n\n(e)\nInput the test set. Decide the class label of this sample based on the voting results from each single classification.\n\nThe random forest is made up of large amount of decision trees. The random operation is introduced in the build process, including the selection of samples subset and feature subset, to guarantee the independence of each decision tree, improve classification accuracy and gain better generalization ability [9].\n\nUsing random operation in selecting sample subset is to pulling the subsets as training sets from the original samples with the method of bagging. This operation ensures the freedom of each preparation subset. In selecting feature subsets, the method of bagging is used again to choose subsets based on the value of variable M from the entire feature set. These feature subsets is used to training datasets. Ranking all the features according to its importance based on the contribution of each training results to final decision is also can be implemented. Variable M has a big influence on the strength and correlation of the random forest. Both of the strength and correlation can be improved with increase of M with in certain range and vice versa. Breiman conducted tests to show that the random forest will have the best performance when the variable M is close to the value of D [9]. (where D indicates the number feature values).\n\nThe random operation in the random forest significantly improved the performance of classifier. Because of the build process of each single decision tree is very fast, the parallelization in the creation of the random forest can be realized, which improve the speed of classification greatly.\n\n4 Literature Review\nAung et al.

The objective of website page classification is to characterize the data on Internet into a specific number of predefined categories. Website pages classification can likewise help enhance the nature of web inquiry. Experiment performed on data collected from Yahoo web site using Decision tree classifier and RFC. They first consider the pattern of the attributes for complete categories of the downloaded web pages. Analyzing the web pages afterwards, they have found that few of the terms are normally present in the similar web pages. The classification accuracy of RFC is compared with classification accuracy of decision tree. Results clears that Random Forest Classifier obtained almost higher than 90% classification accuracy in all categories which is also better than Decision Tree Classifier in all categories of web pages.\n\nAzar et al. [12] experimented on A Random Forest Classifier for Lymph Diseases. Exactness of classification algorithms utilized as a part of sickness diagnosing is positively an imperative issue to be considered. High dimensional information, all in all, requires the extraction of most engaging or discriminative components to be chosen and henceforth the measurement of dataset is lessened. Dimension lessening methodology is helpful to diminish dataset unpredictability with the conceivable favorable position of expanded classification execution. Expelling the quantity of superfluous elements for model usage makes screening tests speedier, more helpful and less expensive and nature of the produced include subset solutions. The lymphatic framework helps the immune framework in expelling and wrecking waste, trash, dead platelets, pathogens, poisons, and disease cells. Additionally, it expels overabundance liquid, and waste items from the interstitial spaces among the cells. Objectives of the experiment are to increase the performance of classification correctness and obtain the significant features as an indicator to the existence of lymph disease class. Genetic Algorithm is used to find an optimal feature set thus it reduces the dimension of lymph dieses dataset. RFC is used for classification task.

Identification methods of liquid include minimum distance algorithm, Bayes algorithm, support vector machines, neural networks and fuzzy recognition method. Experiment performed in paper is for effective classification of liquid from fingerprint droplet which contains liquid of nine different classes. RFC is implemented in python. Out of 650 test samples of different classes of liquid, 648 test samples are correctly recognized which tells that Random Forest Classifier achieves very high recognition rate for the experiment. Class 3 and 5 remain out from 100% recognition rate.\n\nPal [13] has constructed one classifier for Remote Sensing Classification named as Random Forest Classifier. The above mentioned classifier is a tree-based classifier, which supports vector machines, created for increasing the margin amongst two dissimilar classes, that are used in this experiment. The random forest classifier utilizes the Gini Index as a trait choice measure, that measures the polluting influence of an ascribe regarding the classes.

Developed by Leo Breiman in 2001, the essence of RF lies in creating a forest of decision trees where each tree independently contributes to the final decision through a majority voting mechanism. The procedure for building a Random Forest classifier involves selecting random subsets of features for each decision tree, ensuring diversity among the trees, and leveraging bagging to enhance the model's predictive power and robustness against overfitting.\n\nThe fundamental steps in constructing a Random Forest model include determining the number of features (M) for each subset, randomly selecting feature subsets, training decision trees on these subsets, and then using majority voting to classify new data points. This technique introduces randomness not only in selecting the training subsets (via bagging) but also in choosing feature subsets, which significantly boosts the ensemble's performance.\n\nRF\u2019s efficiency and effectiveness have been validated through various studies and applications. For example, experiments have shown that RF outperforms other classifiers, including decision trees, particularly in environments with minimal noise.

A notable\nadvantage of SVMs lies in the fact that they obtain a subset of support vectors during the learning phase, which is often only a small\npart of the original data set. This set of support vectors represents a\ngiven classification task and is formed by a small data set.\nThe rest of this paper is divided as follows: in Section 2 the theoretical basis of SVM are presented; in addition, their characteristics, advantages and disadvantages are described. In Section 3\nweaknesses of SVM are introduced and reviewed. In Section 4 a\nset of SVM implementations are presented. Section 5 shows some\napplications of SVM in real world problems. Finally, Section 6\ncloses the paper with trends and challenges.\n2. Theoretical basis of SVMs\nThe principal objective in pattern classification is to get a model\nwhich maximizes the performance for the training data. Conventional training methods determine the models in such a way that\neach input\u2013output pair is correctly classified within the class to\nwhich it belongs. However, if the classifier is too fit for the training\ndata, the model begins to memorize training data rather than\nlearning to generalize, degrading the generalization ability of the\nclassifier.\nThe main motivation of SVM is to separate several classes in the\ntraining set with a surface that maximizes the margin between\nthem. In other words, SVM allows to maximizing the generalization ability of a model. This is the objective of the Structural Risk\nMinimization principle (SRM) that allows the minimization of a\nbound on the generalization error of a model, instead of minimizing the mean squared error on the set of training data, which is the\nphilosophy often used by the methods of empirical risk\nminimization.\nIn this Section, we discuss Support Vector Machines, in which\ntraining data are linearly separable in the input space and the case\nwhere training data are not linearly separable.\n2.1. Linearly separable case\nTraining a SVM requires a set of n examples. Each example consists of a pair, an input vector xi and the associated label yi. Assume\nthat a training set X is given as:\n\u00f0x1; y1\u00de;\u00f0x2; y2\u00de; ... ;\u00f0xn; yn\u00de \u00f01\u00de\ni:e., X \u00bc fxi; yign\ni\u00bc1 where xi 2 Rd and yi 2 \u00fe\u00f0 \u00de 1; 1 . For reasons of\nvisualization, we will consider the case of a two-dimensional input,\ni.e., x 2 R2. The data are linearly separable and there are many\nhyperplanes that can perform the separation. Fig. 1 shows several\ndecision hyperplanes that perfectly separate the input data set. It\nis clear that there are infinite hyperplanes that could perform this\nwork. However, the generalization ability depends on the location\nof the separation hyperplane and the hyperplane with maximum\nmargin. This hyperplane is called optimal separation hyperplane\n[14]. The decision level, i.e., the hyperplane that separates the input\nspace is defined by the equation wT xi \u00fe b \u00bc 0.\nThe simplest case of SVM is the linearly separable case in the\nfeature space. We optimize the geometric margin by setting the\nfunctional margin kappai \u00bc 1(also called Canonical Hyperplane\n[30]), therefore, the linear classifier yi \u00bc 1,\nw  x\u00fe h i \u00fe b \u00bc 1\nw  x h i \u00fe b \u00bc 1 \u00f02\u00de\nThese can be combined into a set of inequalities:\nyi\u00f0h i\u00fe w  xi b\u00de P 18i \u00f03\u00de\nThe geometric margin of x\u00fe y x is\nci \u00bc 1\n2\nw\nk k w  x\u00fe\nD E  w\nk k w  x\n  D E\n\u00bc 1\n2k k w w  x\u00fe h i  w  x \u00bd \u0004 h i\n\u00bc 1\nk k w\n\u00f04\u00de\nwhere w defines the optimal separation hyperplane and b is the\nbias. The distance between the hyperplane and the training data\nclosest to the hyperplane is called margin. The generalization ability\nis maximized if the optimal separation hyperplane is selected as the\nseparation hyperplane. Optimizing the geometric margin means\nminimizing the norm of the vector of weights. When solving the\nproblem of quadratic programming we try to find the optimal\nhyperplane and two parallel hyperplanes (H1 and H2).\nThe distance between H1 and H2 is maximized and there is no\ndata between the two hyperplanes. When the distance between\nH1and H2 is maximized, some data points can be over H1and some\ndata points can be over H2.These points of data are called support\nvectors [14,30], since they participate directly in defining the separation hyperplane, the other points can be removed or changed\nwithout crossing the planes H1 and H2 and will not modify in\nany way the generalization skill of the classifier, i.e., the solution\nof an SVM is given only by this small set of support vectors. Any\nhyperplane can be represented by w; x and b, where w is a vector\nperpendicular to the hyperplane. Fig. 2 shows the geometric representation of the quadratic programming problem showing H (optimal separator) and hyperplanes H1 and H2. In this way, the original\nproblem of optimization is as follows.\nProposition 1. For the linearly separable case\nS \u00bc x1; y1 \u00f0 \u00de xl; yl \u00bd \u0004 \u00f0 \u00de , if \u00f0 \u00de w; b is the solution\nmin\nw;b\nh i w  w \u00bc k k w 2\nsubject to : yi\u00f0 \u00de h i w  xi \u00fe b P 1\n\u00f05\u00de\nthen the maximal margin is given by c \u00bc 1\nk k w .\nWe change this to the dual problem using the Lagrange formulation. There are two reasons to do this. The first lies in the fact that\nthe conditions given in the Eq. (5) will be replaced by Lagrange\nFig. 1. Separation hyperplanes.\n190 J.

The second is the\nreformulation of the problem, the training data will only appear\nin the form of dot product between vectors.

Introduced by Vapnik, SVMs have garnered attention due to their excellent generalization capabilities, optimal solution finding, and discriminative power. They have been successfully applied across various fields such as data mining and pattern recognition.\n\nSVM operates by mapping input data into a high-dimensional feature space and constructing a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in this space. The goal is to find the hyperplane that has the maximum margin, i.e., the maximum distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data point from any class. This is crucial because maximizing this margin is key to minimizing the classification error and enhancing the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data.\n\nIn cases where the data are linearly separable, SVM looks for the optimal separating hyperplane that divides the classes with the largest margin. It involves finding a particular line (in 2D) or a plane (in higher dimensions) that separates the classes. However, when the data are not linearly separable, SVM uses a kernel trick to map the input space into a higher-dimensional space where a separating hyperplane can be found.\n\nAn important aspect of SVMs is their reliance on support vectors, which are data points closest to the hyperplane. These support vectors are critical since the position of the hyperplane is determined based on these points alone, making SVM less sensitive to the presence of outliers.\n\nThe preparation of an SVM model involves solving an optimization problem that seeks to maximize the margin between the classes while ensuring that data points are classified correctly. Specifically, in the linearly separable case, a quadratic programming problem is solved to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin.\n\nThe techniques involved in training an SVM, such as using Lagrange multipliers and solving the dual problem, offer computational efficiency, particularly because the training data appear in the form of dot products. This dot product form is advantageous when applying the kernel trick for nonlinear classification tasks.\n\nIn summary, SVMs stand out for their strong theoretical foundations, ability to solve both linear and nonlinear problems through the kernel trick, and their efficiency in treating cases where the dimensionality of the feature space is high. Despite these advantages, the choice of kernel and the tuning of model parameters require careful consideration to avoid overfitting and to ensure that the model can generalize well to new, unseen data."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Briefly explain some limitation of SVMs"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Despite their popularity and robust performance across various domains, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) exhibit certain limitations, as outlined below:\n\n1. **Choice of Kernel**: One of the critical decisions when using SVM is the choice of the kernel function. The kernel transforms the input data into a higher-dimensional space where it is easier to find a linear separating hyperplane. However, selecting the appropriate kernel (linear, polynomial, radial basis function, etc.) and its parameters is not straightforward and often requires trial and error or domain expertise. An inappropriate choice can lead to poor model performance.\n\n2. **Scalability and Efficiency**: SVMs can be computationally intensive, especially for large datasets. The training time can become significantly longer as the number of samples increases, limiting its applicability for big data scenarios. This challenge is mainly due to the quadratic programming problem that needs to be solved during the training phase.\n\n3. **Performance with Highly Overlapping Classes**: In cases where the classes in the dataset highly overlap, SVMs might struggle to find an optimal hyperplane that effectively separates the classes, leading to a decrease in classification performance.\n\n4. **Parameter Tuning**: SVMs come with a set of parameters, such as the regularization parameter (C) and kernel-specific parameters, that need careful tuning to achieve optimal performance. Incorrect parameter tuning can lead to overfitting or underfitting. Finding the right parameters often involves extensive search methods, such as grid search or randomized search, which can be time-consuming.\n\n5. **Interpretability**: SVM models, especially those using complex kernels, can be difficult to interpret compared to more straightforward models like decision trees. This lack of interpretability can be a significant drawback in applications where understanding the model's decision-making process is crucial.\n\n6. **Multiclass Classification**: SVM is inherently a binary classifier, which means it is designed for problems with two classes. Although techniques exist to extend SVM for multiclass classification (such as one-vs-all and one-vs-one strategies), these approaches can complicate the model and increase computational costs.\n\n7. **Sensitivity to Noise**: SVMs are sensitive to noise and outliers in the data. A few outliers or wrongly labeled instances can significantly affect the position of the hyperplane and, consequently, the overall model performance.\n\nDespite these limitations, SVMs are a powerful tool for pattern recognition and classification problems. Addressing the challenges requires a good understanding of the dataset, problem domain, and careful preprocessing of the data, along with thoughtful experimentation with the model's parameters and kernel choice."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user asked about the principles of multi-layer neural networks and the assistant provided a detailed explanation of network architecture, including equations and considerations for depth and width.

Let's assume that the network receives\nraw pixels as input. Therefore, to connect the input layer to\nonly one neuron (e.g. in the hidden layer in the Multi- Layer\nperceptron), as an example, there should be 32\u00d732\u00d73 weight\nconnections for the CIFAR-10 dataset.\nFig. 1.

To make it clearer, more than\n6000 weight parameters are used to connect the input to just\nonly two nodes. It may be thought that two neurons might not\nbe enough for any useful processing for an image\nclassification application. To make it more efficient, we can\nconnect the input image to the neurons in the next layer with\nexactly the same values for the height and width. It can be\nassumed this network is applied for the type of processing\nsuch as the edge in the image. However, the mentioned\nnetwork needs 32\u00d732\u00d73 by 32\u00d732 weight connections, which\nare (3,145,728), as in [4,5,14].\nTherefore, looking for a more efficient method, it emerged\nthat instead of a full connection, it is a good idea to look for\nlocal regions in the picture instead of in the whole image.\nFig. 3, shows a regional connection for the next layer. In other\nwords, the hidden neurons in the next layer only get inputs\nfrom the corresponding part of the previous layer. For\nexample, it can only be connected to 5\u00d75 neurons. Thus, if we\nwant to have 32\u00d732 neurons in the next layer, then we will\nhave 5\u00d75\u00d73 by 32x32 connections which is 76,800\nconnections (compared to 3,145,728 for full connectivity), as\nin [1,9,13,14,17].\nAlthough the size of connection drastically dropped, it still\nleaves so many parameters to solve. Another assumption for\nsimplification, is to keep the local connection weights fixed\nfor the entire neurons of the next layer. This will connect the\nneighbor neurons in the next layer with exactly the same\nweight to the local region of the previous layer. Therefore, it\nagain drops many extra parameters, and reduces the number of\nweights to only 5\u00d75\u00d73=75 to connect 32\u00d732\u00d73 neurons to\n32\u00d732 in the next layer [5,8,11].\nThere are many benefits to these simple assumptions. Firstly,\nthe number of connections decrease from around 3\nmillion to only 75 connections in the presented example.\nSecondly, and a more interesting concept, is that fixing the\nweights for the local connections is similar to sliding a\nwindow of 5\u00d75\u00d73 in the input neurons and mapping the\ngenerated output to the corresponding place. It provides an\nopportunity to detect and recognize features regardless of their\npositions in the image. This is the reason why they are called\nconvolutions [6,7,16].\nFig. 3. Convolution as alternative for fully connected network.\nTo show the astounding effect of the convolution matrix,\nFig.4, depicts what will happen if we manually pick the\nconnection weight in a 3\u00d73 window.\nAs we can see Fig.4, the matrix can be set to detect edges\nin the image.

Each layer can be associated\nwith different filters. Therefore, we can extract different\nfeatures from the given image. Fig. 5, shows how they are\nconnected to the different layers. Each layer has its own filter\nand therefore extracts different features from the input. The\nneurons shown in Fig. 5, use a different filter, but look at the\nsame part of the input image.

Try to use your own words, do not directly copy from the above sentences."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The principle of Convolution in neural networks, particularly in the context of image and video processing, can be understood by addressing the inefficiencies of fully connected networks. Let's break it down for clarity:\n\n1. **Problem with Fully Connected Layers:** Imagine we have an input such as a CIFAR-10 color image, which is 32 pixels wide, 32 pixels tall, and has 3 color channels (RGB). If we connect every input pixel to just one neuron in the next layer of a fully connected network, we end up with a massive number of weight connections (32x32x3 for each neuron). This quantity multiplies further as more neurons are added to the layer, leading to an explosive growth in parameters needed to be learned, which is both computationally expensive and inefficient.\n\n2. **Enter Convolution:** The key insight behind using convolution layers instead of fully connected layers lies in recognizing that we can process images more efficiently by focusing on local regions rather than the entire image at once. This is due to the spatial hierarchy in images, where certain features like edges, textures, and patterns can be detected with small, localized filters.\n\n3. **Local Connectivity:** By focusing on small regions (e.g., 5x5 patches) of the input image, we drastically reduce the number of connections. If our goal is to have an output layer that also respects the spatial structure of the image (e.g., a 32x32 grid of neurons each processing a local part of the image), we would use a 5x5x3 filter (capturing the RGB depth) that moves across the input image. This dramatically lessens the parameters count since we're now dealing with a fixed \"window\" of weights across all regions of the image, rather than unique weights for every potential connection. \n\n4. **Parameter Sharing:** An additional layer of efficiency comes from using the same weights across different parts of the image, i.e., the filters are shared. This means that regardless of where a feature appears in the image, our convolutional filter can detect it. This significantly drops the number of unique weights we need to learn, from potentially millions in a fully connected scenario to just the size of the filter (e.g., 5x5x3 = 75 weights).\n\n5. **Feature Detection and Hierarchical Processing:** With convolution, we can design filters that detect specific types of features (edges, corners, etc.) at various layers of the network. Early layers might identify simple features like edges, while deeper layers can recognize more complex patterns. By stacking multiple convolutional layers, each with its own filters, we can process images in a hierarchical fashion, extracting more abstract features at higher levels.\n\n6. **Benefits of Convolution:** The convolution operation dramatically reduces the number of parameters, making the network more efficient and less prone to overfitting. It also enables the network to develop translational invariance, meaning it can recognize features regardless of their position in the input. This makes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) particularly suited for tasks like image recognition, where the spatial hierarchy and position-invariance of features are crucial.\n\nTo summarize, the principle of convolution in neural networks radically improves efficiency by focusing on local connections and reusing a set of weights across the entire input space. This approach not only reduces the computational burden but also aligns with how visual features tend to be distributed in natural images, making it a powerful technique for image and video analysis."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user asked about the concept of pooling in CNNs and provided a detailed explanation.

In the image processing domain, it can be considered as similar to reducing the resolution. Pooling does not affect the number of filters. Max-pooling is one of the most common types of pooling methods. It partitions the image to sub-region rectangles, and it only returns the maximum value of the inside of that sub-region. One of the most common sizes used in max-pooling is 2\u00d72. As can see in Fig. 12, when pooling is performed in the top-left 2\u00d72 blocks (pink area), it moves 2 and focus on top-right part. This means that stride 2 is used in pooling. To avoid down-sampling, stride 1 can be used, which is not common. It should be considered that down-sampling does not preserve the position of the information. Therefore, it should be applied only when the presence of information is important (rather than spatial information). Moreover, pooling can be used with non-equal filters and strides to improve the efficiency. For example, a 3\u00d73 max-pooling with stride 2 keeps some overlaps between the areas. [5,10,16].\n\nFig. 12. - Max-pooling is demonstrated.

Think of it as a method of summarizing or compressing the input features.\n\nMax-pooling is a popular type of pooling that focuses on extracting the highest value from a set region of the input. Imagine you're looking at a small section of an image (for instance, a 2x2 pixel area) and from this tiny area, you only keep the highest value (the brightest pixel, if you will) and discard the rest. This action is repeated across the entire image, examining one 2x2 area at a time, which effectively reduces the overall size of the input feature map because after pooling, four pixels are represented by just one pixel (the maximum value among them). \n\nThe process uses what's called a 'stride,' which dictates how far the pooling operation jumps across the input features after each operation. A stride of 2, for example, means that every time the pooling is done, it moves two pixels over to start the next pooling operation, which contributes to the downsizing effect as it doesn't overlap with the previously pooled areas.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while pooling makes the input features smaller and more manageable, it does so by losing some spatial detail. For instance, because it focuses on whether a feature is present rather than where exactly it is located, fine details can be lost. This downside is acceptable in many scenarios where the presence of features is more critical than their precise locations.\n\nFor applications where it's important not to downsample too aggressively, different configurations of filter sizes and strides can be employed. For instance, using a 3x3 filter with a stride of 2 can provide overlapping pooled regions, which might retain more information than non-overlapping regions.\n\nIn essence, the main takeaway about pooling in CNNs is that it is a strategic trade-off between reducing computational complexity and potentially losing some spatial information, with the decision on how exactly to implement pooling (e.g., size of the filter, stride) depending on the specific requirements and goals of the neural network in question."}]}]}, {"summary": "The user asked about learning rate scheduling in deep learning, seeking a custom schedule that increases and decreases the learning rate at specific epochs.

The exact factor by which the learning rate is decreased (in this example, a factor of 0.1) and later increased back to the initial rate can be adjusted as needed.\n\nRemember, the effectiveness of such a learning rate schedule can depend heavily on the specifics of your task, dataset, and network architecture. It's always a good idea to experiment with different scheduling strategies and parameters to find what works best for your particular application.\n"}]}, {"facetValue": "The user inquired about learning rate scheduling in deep learning, specifically asking if a method exists that starts with a learning rate, decays it, and then increases it again at a specific epoch.

This strategy, however, is not typically standard or common in its precise form as you described but can be implemented with custom scheduling. The concept you're touching upon aligns with the idea of non-monotonic learning rate schedules, which have been explored to varying extents in the field of deep learning. A closely related and more formalized scheduling strategy that involves increasing the learning rate after having decreased it, is known as a cyclical learning rate (CLR).\n\n### Cyclical Learning Rate (CLR)\n\nProposed by Leslie N. Smith in 2015, the cyclical learning rate strategy allows the learning rate to cyclically vary between a lower bound and an upper bound, rather than setting it to a constant value or following a monotonically decreasing schedule. The idea behind CLR is to allow the model to escape local minima or saddle points during training, potentially leading to better convergence properties.\n\nCLR encompasses several variations, including:\n\n- **Triangular**: The simplest form where the learning rate cyclically varies between the minimum (base) and maximum boundaries in a triangular fashion.\n- **Triangular2**: Similar to triangular policy but the maximum learning rate drops after each cycle, usually halving each time.\n- **Exp Range**: The learning rate decreases after each cycle but in an exponential manner, allowing for a form of exponential decay with the benefits of cyclical variation.\n\n### Implementing Custom Scheduling\n\nWhile the CLR or other predefined schedules (like step decay, exponential decay, etc.) might not precisely match the example you provided (initial decay, then a specific point of increase, followed by possible further adjustments), you can implement custom learning rate schedules in most deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. For example, using PyTorch, you can subclass `_LRScheduler` and define your own `get_lr()` method to specify exactly how you want the learning rate to change over time, including the specific behavior you mentioned.\n\n### Why This Approach?\n\nThe rationale behind strategies that vary the learning rate in non-monotonic ways, including increasing it after having decreased, is to potentially enable the training process to:\n\n- Escape from sharp minima which generalizes poorly to the validation/test set.\n- Overcome areas of the loss landscape that are flat but not optimal, by giving the optimization process a \"kick\" to continue exploring.\n- Find better minima by revisiting areas of the parameter space previously explored with a higher learning rate.\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of such schedules is highly dependent on the specific problem, the architecture of the model, and other hyperparameters. Experimentation and validation are crucial to determining the optimal learning rate schedule for a given scenario."}]}]}, {"summary": "The user engaged in detailed discussions about backpropagation, asking for mathematical explanations, update rules, and advantages.

Imagine that we want to build a system that can classify images as containing, say, a house, a car, a person or a pet. We first collect a large data set of images of houses, cars, people and pets, each labelled with its category. During training, the machine is shown an image and produces an output in the form of a vector of scores, one for each category. We want the desired category to have the highest score of all categories, but this is unlikely to happen before training. We compute an objective function that measures the error (or distance) between the output scores and the desired pattern of scores. The machine then modifies its internal adjustable parameters to reduce this error. These adjustable parameters, often called weights, are real numbers that can be seen as 'knobs' that define the input\u2013output function of the machine. In a typical deep-learning system, there may be hundreds of millions of these adjustable weights, and hundreds of millions of labelled examples with which to train the machine.\n\nTo properly adjust the weight vector, the learning algorithm computes a gradient vector that, for each weight, indicates by what amount the error would increase or decrease if the weight were increased by a tiny amount. The weight vector is then adjusted in the opposite direction to the gradient vector.\n\nThe objective function, averaged over all the training examples, can be seen as a kind of hilly landscape in the high-dimensional space of weight values. The negative gradient vector indicates the direction of steepest descent in this landscape, taking it closer to a minimum, where the output error is low on average.\n\nIn practice, most practitioners use a procedure called stochastic gradient descent (SGD). This consists of showing the input vector for a few examples, computing the outputs and the errors, computing the average gradient for those examples, and adjusting the weights accordingly. The process is repeated for many small sets of examples from the training set until the average of the objective function stops decreasing. It is called stochastic because each small set of examples gives a noisy estimate of the average gradient over all examples. This simple procedure usually finds a good set of weights surprisingly quickly when compared with far more elaborate optimization techniques18. After training, the performance of the system is measured on a different set of examples called a test set. This serves to test the generalization ability of the machine \u2014 its ability to produce sensible answers on new inputs that it has never seen during training.\n\nMany of the current practical applications of machine learning use linear classifiers on top of hand-engineered features. A two-class linear classifier computes a weighted sum of the feature vector components. If the weighted sum is above a threshold, the input is classified as belonging to a particular category.\n\nSince the 1960s we have known that linear classifiers can only carve their input space into very simple regions, namely half-spaces separated by a hyperplane19. But problems such as image and speech recognition require the input\u2013output function to be insensitive to irrelevant variations of the input, such as variations in position, orientation or illumination of an object, or variations in the pitch or accent of speech, while being very sensitive to particular minute variations (for example, the difference between a white wolf and a breed of wolf-like white dog called a Samoyed). At the pixel level, images of two Samoyeds in different poses and in different environments may be very different from each other, whereas two images of a Samoyed and a wolf in the same position and on similar backgrounds may be very similar to each other. A linear classifier, or any other 'shallow' classifier operating on raw pixels could not possibly distinguish the latter two, while putting the former two in the same category. This is why shallow classifiers require a good feature extractor that solves the selectivity\u2013invariance dilemma \u2014 one that produces representations that are selective to the aspects of the image that are important for discrimination, but that are invariant to irrelevant aspects such as the pose of the animal. To make classifiers more powerful, one can use generic non-linear features, as with kernel methods20, but generic features such as those arising with the Gaussian kernel do not allow the learner to generalize well far from the training examples21. The conventional option is to hand design good feature extractors, which requires a considerable amount of engineering skill and domain expertise. But this can all be avoided if good features can be learned automatically using a general-purpose learning procedure. This is the key advantage of deep learning.\"\nFrom the above paper, summarize some benefit of using deep learning compare to traditional machine learning in paragraphs, try to use your own words, do not directly copy the sentence from the above paper"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Deep learning distinguishes itself from traditional machine learning approaches by its unparalleled capability in feature extraction and its ability to handle complex, non-linear problems which are commonplace in real-world data, such as images and speech. Traditional machine learning relies heavily on manually engineered features, requiring domain expertise and significant effort to create models sensitive to relevant variations in the data while disregarding irrelevant variations. This manual feature engineering is not only time-consuming but may not capture the nuances necessary for high accuracy in tasks like image and speech recognition.\n\nOne significant advantage of deep learning is its automated feature learning capability. Unlike traditional methods, deep learning algorithms are designed to automatically learn high-level features from the data itself, without requiring manual intervention. This self-learning ability enables deep learning models to excel in tasks that are exceptionally challenging for traditional algorithms, such as distinguishing between highly similar objects (e.g., different breeds of dogs) under varying conditions (e.g., changes in position, orientation, or lighting). This is primarily because deep learning systems can capture and differentiate minute and complex variations in the input data through multiple layers of non-linear transformations.\n\nDeep learning's architecture, particularly in deep neural networks, comprises potentially hundreds of millions of adjustable parameters (weights), allowing these models to learn highly intricate patterns within large datasets. Through a process like stochastic gradient descent (SGD), deep learning models iteratively adjust these parameters to minimize the error between the predicted and actual outcomes, effectively navigating the \"hilly landscape\" of high-dimensional space to find the optimal solution. This capacity for automatic feature learning and complex pattern recognition translates into superior performance on a wide array of tasks, including those where traditional machine learning methods struggle due to the limitations of linear classifiers and the requirement for handcrafted features.\n\nIn conclusion, deep learning offers a compelling suite of benefits over traditional machine learning, chiefly through its ability to learn features automatically and its proficiency in handling complex, non-linear problems.

It involves calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight in the network by the chain rule, enabling efficient optimization of these weights. Let's break down the process in a more straightforward manner using mathematical expressions and an explanation in my own words.\n\n**1. Feedforward Pass:**\nFirst, we initialize our journey by feeding the input forward through the network. At every layer, the output is computed based on the inputs from the previous layer, the weights, and biases until the final output is obtained. This step is crucial to get the final prediction of the network before updating the weights. The mathematical expression can be defined as follows for each layer \\(l\\), from the input layer \\(1\\) to the output layer \\(L\\):\n\n\\[ h^{(l)} = g\\left(\\theta^{(l-1)T} h^{(l-1)} + b^{(l-1)}\\right) \\]\n\nwhere \\(g\\) is the activation function, \\(h^{(l)}\\) is the output of layer \\(l\\), \\(\\theta^{(l-1)}\\) are the weights, and \\(b^{(l-1)}\\) are the biases.\n\n**2. Compute Output Error:**\nOnce we reach the output layer, we calculate the error (\\(\\delta\\)) of our prediction. This step measures how much the network's prediction deviates from the actual target values. For the output layer \\(L\\), the error can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\delta^{(L)} = 2(h^{(L)} - y) \\cdot g'(\\theta^{(L-1)T} h^{(L-1)} + b^{(L-1)}) \\]\n\nwhere \\(y\\) is the true value, and \\(g'\\) denotes the derivative of the activation function, indicating how we should adjust the weights based on the error.\n\n**3. Backward Pass:**\nThe backward pass involves propagating the output error back through the network to update the weights and biases. We calculate the error for each layer going backwards which tells us how much each layer's output needs to change to reduce the overall error. For each layer \\(l\\) from \\(L-1\\) down to \\(2\\), we compute:\n\n\\[ \\delta^{(l)} = (\\theta^{(l)T} \\delta^{(l+1)}) \\cdot g'(\\theta^{(l-1)T} h^{(l-1)} + b^{(l-1)}) \\]\n\nThis equation calculates the error for current layer based on the error of the layer above and the gradient of the activation function, effectively distributing responsibility for the output error among all neurons in the network.\n\n**4. Gradient Calculation:**\nFinally, we update the weights and biases by calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter. This informs us how to tweak the weights and biases to reduce the error. The updates are computed as follows:\n\n- For weights: \\(\\Delta\\theta^{(l)} = \\delta^{(l+1)} (h^{(l)})^T\\)\n- For biases: \\(\\Delta b^{(l)} = \\delta^{(l+1)}\\)\n\nThese gradients tell us the direction in which to update our parameters to minimize the loss.\n\nThe backpropagation algorithm uses these principles to iteratively adjust the weights and biases, moving towards minimizing the loss function and thereby improving the model's accuracy with each iteration.

It fundamentally relies on calculus and the chain rule for computing derivatives efficiently. Here's a breakdown of the process into a step-by-step mathematical explanation:\n\n1. **Feedforward Pass**: \n\nFirst, we propagate the input through the network to obtain the output. For each layer \\(l\\) from 1 to \\(L\\) (with \\(L\\) being the output layer), we calculate the input's activation \\(h^l\\) using the formula:\n\\[h^{l} = g(\\Theta^{(l-1)T} h^{(l-1)} + b^{(l-1)})\\]\nwhere \\(g\\) is the activation function, \\(\\Theta^{(l-1)}\\) represents the weights from layer \\(l-1\\) to layer \\(l\\), \\(b^{(l-1)}\\) is the bias for layer \\(l\\), and \\(h^{(l-1)}\\) is the activation of the previous layer (with \\(h^{0} = x\\), the input vector).\n\n2. **Output Layer Error Calculation**:\n\nIn the output layer, we compute the initial error term \\(\\delta^{(L)}\\) which represents the difference between the network output \\(h^{(L)}\\) and the actual output \\(y\\). This is calculated using the derivative of the loss function with respect to the activation of the output layer, often for squared error this looks like:\n\\[\\delta^{(L)} = 2(h^{(L)} - y) * g'(\\Theta^{(L-1)T} h^{(L-1)} + b^{(L-1)})\\]\nwhere \\(g'\\) represents the derivative of the activation function.\n\n3. **Backward Pass**:\n\nNow we propagate the error backwards from the output towards the input layer. For each layer \\(l = L-1\\) down to \\(2\\), the error term \\(\\delta^{(l)}\\) for each neuron is computed as a function of the error term in the following layer:\n\\[\\delta^{(l)} = (\\Theta^{(l)T} \\delta^{(l+1)}) * g'(\\Theta^{(l-1)T} h^{(l-1)} + b^{(l-1)})\\]\nThis captures the intuition that the contribution of each neuron to the error of the neuron in the next layer is proportional to the weight connecting them, modulated by the derivative of the activation function (reflecting how changes in input affect changes in output).\n\n4. **Gradient Computation**:\n\nFinally, we compute the gradients (partial derivatives) of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases. The gradient with respect to the weights between layers \\(l\\) and \\(l+1\\) is given by:\n\\[\\Delta\\Theta^{(l)} = h^{(l)} (\\delta^{(l+1)})^T\\]\nWhile the gradient with respect to the biases is simply the error term:\n\\[\\Delta b^{(l)} = \\delta^{(l+1)}\\]\nThese formulas indicate that the change needed in each weight or bias is a product of the error term and the activation of the neuron feeding into it, highlighting the relationship between how much a neuron's output needs to change and how it should adjust its inputs to achieve that change.\n\nIn essence, the backpropagation algorithm adopts a systematic approach, relying on the chain rule, to understand how each component of the neural network (each weight and bias) contributes to the overall error, and thus how to adjust each to minimize this error.

Here's how it's done mathematically:\n\n### Update Equation for Weights\n\nGiven the gradient of the loss with respect to the weights, \\(\\Delta\\theta^{(l)}\\), calculated during backpropagation for layer \\(l\\), the update equation for the weights is:\n\n\\[\\theta^{(l)}_{\\text{new}} = \\theta^{(l)} - \\eta \\cdot \\Delta\\theta^{(l)}\\]\n\nThis equation means that we update each weight by subtracting a fraction (determined by the learning rate \\(\\eta\\)) of the calculated gradient. This fraction is essentially how big of a step we take in the direction that minimally reduces the loss, with each iteration of training.\n\n### Update Equation for Biases\n\nSimilarly, given the gradient of the loss with respect to the biases, \\(\\Delta b^{(l)}\\), the update equation for the biases is:\n\n\\[b^{(l)}_{\\text{new}} = b^{(l)} - \\eta \\cdot \\Delta b^{(l)}\\]\n\nAgain, we update each bias by subtracting a fraction (determined by the learning rate \\(\\eta\\)) of the calculated gradient.\n\n### Importance of Learning Rate (\\(\\eta\\))\n\n- The learning rate \\(\\eta\\) is a hyperparameter that controls how much we are adjusting the weights of our network with respect to the loss gradient. A too small learning rate makes the learning process slow, as the steps towards the minimum of the loss function are tiny. Conversely, a too large learning rate can cause the learning process to oscillate or even diverge, as the steps taken might overshoot the minimum.\n\n### Illustrative Example\n\nSuppose you have a gradient calculated for a particular weight \\(\\Delta\\theta = 0.05\\) and your learning rate \\(\\eta = 0.01\\). The update rule for the weight would be:\n\n\\[ \\theta_{\\text{new}} = \\theta - 0.01 \\cdot 0.05 = \\theta - 0.0005 \\]\n\nSo, if the current value of \\(\\theta = 0.5\\), then after the update, \\(\\theta_{\\text{new}} = 0.5 - 0.0005 = 0.4995\\).\n\nExecuting this update process iteratively across all weights and biases in the network by using the whole dataset (or batches of it) is how neural networks \"learn\" from the input data. The goal is to iteratively decrease the error (loss) the network makes on its predictions, thereby increasing its accuracy and generalization capability to unseen data over time."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Use arrow to represent update"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! When using arrows (\u2192) to represent the update process in equations, it visually signifies the transition from the old value of a parameter to its new value after the update.

Without back-propagation, the training of deep networks would be impractical, as earlier layers would struggle to adjust their weights appropriately to minimize loss.\n\n3. **Scalability**: Back-propagation scales relatively well with increasing network size and complexity, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from simple tasks to those requiring deep and complex neural network architectures.\n\n4. **Adaptability with Various Architectures**: It is versatile and can be applied to different types of neural network architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and others. This versatility is a huge advantage because it means the fundamental learning method doesn\u2019t need to change drastically as new neural network architectures are developed.\n\n5. **Integration with Optimization Techniques**: Back-propagation is compatible with a variety of optimization algorithms (e.g., SGD, Adam, RMSprop) that influence how the network weights are updated based on the computed gradients. This compatibility allows for flexibility in finding the most effective way to minimize the loss function.\n\n6. **Generalization to New Data**: By adjusting the weights to minimize the loss on a training dataset, neural networks trained using back-propagation can generalize well to new, unseen data. This ability is crucial for practical applications where the model needs to make predictions on data it has not explicitly been trained on.\n\n7. **Automatic Feature Learning**: Back-propagation enables the network to automatically learn features from raw data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. This is particularly advantageous in complex data domains like image and speech recognition, where designing hand-crafted features would be extremely challenging.\n\nIn summary, back-propagation is an essential algorithm that allows for the practical training of neural networks across a wide range of complexity and applications, leading to the current successes observed in the field of deep learning."}, {"role": "user", "content": "In few sentences"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Back-propagation is a pivotal algorithm for training neural networks, known for its ability to efficiently compute gradients for weight updates, thereby facilitating the training of deep and complex architectures.

used. However, after a detailed review, here are a few considerations and potential issues:\n\n1. **Data and Mask Handling in Training Loop:**\n   - The code assumes that indices `0` are used for padding tokens both in `src_data` and `tgt_data`. It correctly generates masks based on these padding tokens, which is a typical approach. Ensure your dataset adheres to this assumption.\n\n2. **Target Mask Calculation (Causality Mask):**\n   - In the `generate_mask` function, the causality (or future-blinding) mask is correctly combined with the target padding mask, ensuring that a decoder token does not attend to future tokens. This is achieved using `nopeak_mask`, and it seems correctly implemented. However, ensure that this logic works as intended in your environment, especially the `.bool()` cast for compatibility across different versions of PyTorch.\n\n3. **Potential Efficiency Improvements:**\n   - While not an error, there might be areas for computational efficiency improvement, especially regarding how masks are applied and ensuring that operations are batched effectively. Profiling your code could expose opportunities for such optimizations.\n\n4. **Loss Function Application:**\n   - The application of the loss function correctly flattens the output and target tensors to compute the CrossEntropy loss. Ensure that the `ignore_index=0` properly ignores the padding tokens for your task, which seems to be the intention.\n\n5. **Environment and Dependency Versions:**\n   - This code is written with certain assumptions about the PyTorch version and its API. If future versions introduce breaking changes to methods like `torch.triu`, `nn.Linear`, or the optimizer, adjustments may be needed. Always consult the documentation for the specific version of PyTorch you are using.\n\n6. **Dimensionality and Shape Checks:**\n   - It may be beneficial to add explicit shape or dimensionality checks within your modules, especially before operations that assume certain tensor shapes. This can help in catching shape mismatches early, which can be particularly helpful during development and scaling to different model sizes or input dimensions.\n\n7. **Error Handling and Assertions:**\n   - The use of an assertion at the beginning of the `MultiHeadAttention` initialization to ensure `d_model` is divisible by `num_heads` is a good practice. You might want to add similar assertions or error-handling blocks in other critical points, ensuring assumptions about dimensions, data types, or value ranges are met.\n\nIn summary, while no glaring errors are present that would prevent the code from running under typical conditions expected in a Transformer model training scenario, the considerations above are worth reflecting on, especially if encountering unexpected behavior or planning to adapt the code for different applications or datasets."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user asked for a detailed analysis of potential improvements to transformer architectures and then requested a journal entry from the AI about its experience responding.

E.g. limited in-context learning ability (attention mechanism have been proven to be mathematically similar in regression task with one-step of SGD); tend to be conservative in predictions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Transformers, since their inception, have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) and beyond, allowing for significant breakthroughs in machine translation, text generation, and more. However, despite their considerable success, this architecture is not without its limitations and failure modes. Understanding these weaknesses is crucial for future research and applications.\n\n### Limited In-Context Learning Ability\n\nOne of the primary limitations of transformers is their constrained in-context learning capability. Due to their architectural design, transformers analyze data within a fixed limited context window (defined by the sequence length they can process), hindering their ability to grasp long-term dependencies fully. This limitation affects their performance on tasks that require understanding or memorizing information beyond their immediate context window. While efforts have been made to extend this window, such as with models like Longformer or BigBird, these solutions often bring additional computational complexity or other trade-offs.\n\n### Conservatism in Predictions\n\nTransformers also tend to be conservative in their predictions. This inclination towards conservativeness stems from their training objective, which often optimizes for a likelihood that prefers safer, more probable outputs over potentially more accurate but less likely ones. While this trait can be beneficial in certain applications where reliability is paramount, it can stifle creativity and innovation in generative tasks like text generation or creative design, where bold and novel outputs might be preferred.\n\n### Mathematically Similar to SGD in Regression Tasks\n\nAn interesting critique is the mathematical similarity of the attention mechanism in transformers to a single step of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) when applied to regression tasks. This parallel suggests that while transformers are powerful, their mechanism can be conceptually simple or even limited when adapting to tasks outside their primary domain, such as more traditional regression problems. This observation underscores a possible narrowness in the way transformers learn from data, potentially restricting their versatility and adaptability.\n\n### Over-parameterization and Environmental Costs\n\nTransformers, particularly the larger models, are notorious for their vast number of parameters. These large models require substantial computational resources not just for training but also for fine-tuning and inference, leading to significant energy consumption and associated environmental costs. The reliance on over-parameterized models raises concerns about the sustainability and accessibility of transformer technology, limiting its adoption to entities that can afford such computational resources.\n\n### Vulnerability to Adversarial Attacks\n\nLastly, transformers, like many deep learning models, are susceptible to adversarial attacks. These attacks exploit the model\u2019s inability to generalize well to slightly modified input data designed to deceive the model, leading to incorrect outputs or predictions. The sophistication and the myriad forms of such adversarial perturbations represent a critical vulnerability in transformers, especially in sensitive applications like misinformation detection or security.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, while transformers have indeed marked a significant advance in various domains, they are not without their failure modes and limitations. Their limited in-context learning ability, tendency towards conservative predictions, conceptual similarities to simple optimization algorithms in certain tasks, over-parameterization, and vulnerability to adversarial attacks are among the primary concerns. Addressing these limitations requires ongoing research and conceptual innovations beyond simply scaling up existing models. Understanding and overcoming these challenges will be crucial in realizing the full potential of transformer architectures in an ethical, sustainable, and broadly beneficial way."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How more capable architecture might look like? E.g. if we aim for meta-model abilities, like activation patterns resembling of virtual runtime within model process. Or ability to do inference reasoning. Think out of the box. I have master degree in CS - avoid common misconceptions which plague ML field (even among experts)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In envisioning a more capable architecture that addresses the current limitations of transformers while also aiming for meta-model abilities, we might consider several innovative directions that pull from across the computational sciences and even cognitive science to inspire new methodologies. The aim would be to develop an architecture that not only processes information more efficiently and flexibly but also possesses an intrinsic understanding and reasoning capability, much like a highly adaptive and context-aware system. \n\n### 1. Neuromorphic Computing Paradigm\n\nLeveraging insights from how the human brain processes information, a more capable architecture could mimic the brain's efficiency and adaptability. Neuromorphic computing attempts to emulate the neural structure of the human brain in silicon, suggesting that a computing architecture designed along similar principles could significantly enhance learning efficiency and decision-making. For AI, this could mean developing systems that learn with significantly fewer data points and are capable of more generalized reasoning without the vast amounts of labeled data required by current models.\n\n### 2. Dynamic Schema-Based Architectures\n\nCurrent transformer models are essentially static in their processing, utilizing the same mechanisms regardless of the task at hand. In contrast, a dynamic schema-based architecture would allow the model to adapt its processing pathway based on the context or the nature of the task, much like choosing a different \"lens\" to view the problem through. This could involve dynamically reconfiguring the network's structure in real-time or activating certain pathways over others based on an internal assessment of the task requirements, akin to a virtual runtime environment within the model that optimizes processing strategies.\n\n### 3. Contextual Hyperdimensional Computing\n\nHyperdimensional computing operates on the principle of encoding information in high-dimensional spaces, where the dimensionality is in the thousands or millions. This method of representation could equip AI models with a vastly more efficient and powerful means of capturing context, enabling a form of in-context learning and reasoning that goes beyond the sequential window limitations of current transformers. Implementing this within a computing architecture could provide a way to inherently capture and reason about larger contexts without the exponential increase in computational cost.\n\n### 4. Incorporation of Counterfactual Reasoning\n\nA significant step towards advanced inference reasoning would be for models to inherently consider not just the data they are given but the multitude of possibilities that data implies. This involves not just processing the immediate information but generating and evaluating counterfactual scenarios. Such an architecture would need to be capable of \"imagining\" different outcomes based on varying inputs and then reasoning about the likelihood and implications of those outcomes, moving closer to genuine comprehension and decision-making abilities.\n\n### 5. Self-Reflective Learning Loop\n\nFundamental to achieving meta-model abilities is for the architecture to possess a form of self-awareness or at least an operational equivalent. This would mean implementing a continuous, self-reflective learning loop within the architecture, where it can assess its performance, identify gaps or inaccuracies, and adjust its learning process accordingly without external intervention. This ability could be facilitated by meta-learning strategies but would require a more complex internal evaluation mechanism that goes beyond current self-improvement methods in AI.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor AI to transcend its current limitations and edge closer to genuine intelligence and adaptability, future architectures will likely need to be radically different from today\u2019s models. Drawing inspiration from biological systems, leveraging multidimensional data representation, enabling dynamic structural adaptation, incorporating reasoning about the non-actual, and fostering self-improvement capabilities represent formidable challenges but also potential pathways to developing truly advanced AI systems.

Hensman and Masko [79] first show that balancing the training data with ROS can improve the classification of imbalanced image data. Then RUS and augmentation methods are used by Lee et al. [20] to decrease class imbalance for the purpose of pre-training a deep CNN. Pouyanfar et al. [21] introduce a new dynamic sampling method that adjusts sampling rates according to class-wise performance. Finally, Buda et al. [23] compare RUS, ROS, and two-phase learning across multiple imbalanced image data sets.\n\nBalancing training data with ROS\nHensman and Masko [79] explored the effects of class imbalance and ROS using deep CNNs. The CIFAR-10 [80] benchmark data set, comprised of 10 classes with 6000 images per class, was used to generate 10 imbalanced data sets for testing. These 10 generated data sets contained varying class sizes, ranging between 6% and 15% of the total data set, producing a max imbalance ratio \n. In addition to varying the class size, the different distributions also varied the number of minority classes, where a minority class is any class smaller than the largest class. For example, a major 50\u201350 split (Dist. 3) reduced five of the classes to 6% of the data set size and increased five of the classes to 14%. As another example, a major singular over-representation (Dist. 5) increased the size of the airplane class to 14.5%, reducing the other nine classes slightly to 9.5%.\n\nA variant of the AlexNet [17] CNN, which has proven to perform well on CIFAR-10, was used for all experiments by Hensman and Masko. The baseline performance was defined by training the CNN on all distributions with no data sampling. The ROS method being evaluated consisted of randomly duplicating samples from the minority classes until all classes in the training set had an equal number of samples.\n\nHensman and Masko presented their results as the percentage of correct answers per class, and included the mean score for all classes, denoted by Total. To ensure results were valid, a total of three runs were completed for each experiment and then averaged. Table 3 shows the results of the CNN without any data sampling. These results demonstrate the impact of class imbalance when training a CNN model. Most of the imbalanced distributions saw a loss in performance. Dist. 6 and Dist. 7, which contained very slight imbalance and no over-representation, performed just as well as the original balanced distribution. Some of the imbalanced distributions that contained over-represented classes, e.g. Dist. 5 and Dist. 9, yielded useless models that were completely biased towards the majority group.\n\nTable 4 includes the results of training the CNN with balanced data that was generated through ROS. It shows that over-sampling performs significantly better than the baseline results from Table 3. Dist. 1 is excluded from Table 4 because it is already balanced, i.e. ROS is not applicable. In this experiment, ROS improved the classification results for all distributions. Dist. 5 and Dist. 9 saw the largest performance gains, increasing from baseline Total F1-scores of 0.10 up to 0.73 and 0.72, respectively. The ROS classification results for distributions Dist. 2\u2013Dist. 11 are comparable to the results achieved by the baseline CNN on Dist. 1, suggesting that ROS has completely restored model performance.\n\nTable 3 Imbalanced CIFAR-10 classification [79]\nFull size table\nTable 4 Imbalanced CIFAR-10 classification with ROS [79]\nFull size table\nThe experiments by Hensman and Masko show that applying ROS to the level of class balance can be effective in addressing slight class imbalance in image data. It is also made clear by some of the results in Table 3 that small levels of imbalance are able to prevent a CNN from converging to an acceptable solution. We believe that the low imbalance levels tested (\n) is the biggest limitation of this experiment, as imbalance levels are typically much higher in practice. Besides exploring additional data sets and higher levels of imbalance, one area worth pursuing further is the total number of epochs completed during training on the imbalanced data. In these experiments, only 10 epochs over the training data were completed because the authors were more interested in comparing performance than they were in achieving high performance. Running additional epochs would help to rule out whether or not the poor performance was due to the slow convergence phenomenon described by Anand et al.\n\nAt the time of writing, May 2015, Hensman and Masko observed no existing research that examined the impact of class imbalance on deep learning with popular benchmark data sets. Our literature review also finds this to be true, confirming that addressing class imbalance with deep learning is still relatively immature and understudied.\n\nTwo-phase learning\nLee et al. [20] combined RUS with transfer learning to classify highly-imbalanced data sets of plankton images, WHOI-Plankton [81]. The data set contains 3.4 million images spread over 103 classes, with 90% of the images comprised of just five classes and the 5th largest class making up just 1.3% of the entire data set. Imbalance ratios of \n are exhibited in the data set, with many classes making up less than 0.1% of the data set. The proposed method is the two-phase learning procedure, where a deep CNN is first pre-trained with thresholded data, and then fine-tuned using all data. The thresholded data sets for pre-training are constructed by randomly under-sampling large classes until they reach a threshold of N examples. The authors selected a threshold of \n through preliminary experiments, then down-sampled all large classes to N samples. The proposed model (G) was compared to six alternative methods (A\u2013F), a combination of transfer learning and augmentation techniques, using unweighted average F1-scores to compare results.\n\n(A)\nFull: CNN trained with original imbalanced data set.\n\n(B)\nNoise: CNN trained with augmented data, where minority classes are duplicated through noise injection until all classes contain at least 1000 samples.\n\n(C)\nAug: CNN trained with augmented data, where minority classes are duplicated through rotation, scaling, translation, and flipping of images until all classes contain at least 1000 samples.\n\n(D)\nThresh: CNN trained with thresholded data, generated through random under-sampling until all classes have at most 5000 samples.\n\n(E)\nNoise + full: CNN pre-trained with the noise-augmented data from (B), then fine-tuned using the full data set.\n\n(F)\nAug + full: CNN pre-trained with the transform-augmented data from (C), then fine-tuned using the full data set.\n\n(G)\nThresh + full: CNN pre-trained using the thresholded data set from (D), then fine-tuned using the full imbalanced data set.\n\nResults from Lee et al.\u2019s experiments are presented in Table 5, where the L5 and Rest columns are the unweighted average F1-scores for the largest five classes and the remaining minority classes, respectively. Comparing methods (B\u2013D) shows that under-sampling (D) outperforms both noise injection (B) and augmentation (C) over-sampling methods on the given data set for all classes. Methods (B\u2013D) saw moderate improvements on the Rest group when compared to the baseline (A), but the L5 group suffered sufficient loss in performance. Re-training the model with the full data set in (E\u2013G) allowed the models to re-capture the distribution of the L5 group. The proposed model (G) achieved the highest F1-score (0.7791) on the L5 group, and greatly improved the F1-score of the Rest group from 0.1548 to 0.3262 with respect to the baseline.\n\nTable 5 Two-phase learning with WHOI-Plankton (Avg. F1-score) [20]\nFull size table\nThe two-phase learning procedure presented by Lee et al. has proven effective in increasing the minority class performance while still preserving the majority class performance. Unlike plain RUS, which completely removes potentially useful information from the training set, the two-phase learning method only removes samples from the majority group during the pre-training phase. This allows the minority group to contribute more to the gradient during pre-training, and still allows the model to see all of the available data during the fine-tuning phase. The authors did not include details on the pre-training phase, such as the number of pre-training epochs or the criteria used to determine when pre-training was complete. These details should be considered in future works, as pre-training that results in high bias or high variance will certainly impact the final model\u2019s class-wise performance. Future work can also consider a hybrid approach, where the model is pre-trained with data that is generated through a combination of under-sampling majority classes and augmenting minority classes.\n\nThe previous year, Havaei et al. [82] used a similar two-phase learning procedure to manage class imbalance when performing brain tumor image segmentation. The brain tumor data contains minority classes that make up less than 1% of the total data set. Havaei et al. stated that the two-phase learning procedure was critical in dealing with the imbalanced distribution in their image data. The details of this paper are not included in this survey because the two-phase learning is just one small component of their domain-specific experiments.\n\nDynamic sampling\nPouyanfar et al. [21] used a dynamic sampling technique to perform classification of imbalanced image data with a deep CNN. The basic idea is to over-sample the low performing classes and under-sample the high performing classes, showing the model less of what it has already learned and more of what it does not understand yet. This is somewhat analogous to how humans learn, by moving on from easy tasks once learned and focusing attention on the more difficult tasks. The author\u2019s self-collected data set contains over 10,000 images captured from publicly available network cameras, including a total of 19 semantic concepts, e.g. intersection, forest, farm, sky, water, playground, and park. From the original data set, 70% is used for training models, 20% is used for validation, and 10% is set aside for testing. The authors report imbalance ratios in the data set as high as \n. Average F1-scores and weighted average F1-scores are used to compare the proposed model to a baseline CNN (A) and four alternative methods for handling class imbalance (B\u2013E).\n\nThe system presented by Pouyanfar et al. includes three core components: real time data augmentation, transfer learning, and a novel dynamic sampling method. Real time data augmentation improves generalization by applying various transformations to select images in each training batch. Transfer learning is achieved by fine-tuning an Inception-V3 network [83] that was pre-trained using ImageNet [84] data. The dynamic sampling method is the main contribution relative to class imbalance.\n\n(11)\n is a vector containing all individual class F1-scores after iteration i, and \n denotes the F1-score for class j on iteration i, where F1-scores are calculated for each class in a one-versus-all manner. During the next iteration, classes with lower F1-scores are sampled at a higher rate, forcing the learner to focus more on examples previously misclassified. Eq. 11 is used to obtain the next iteration\u2019s sample size for a given class \n, where \n is the average class size. To prevent over-fitting of the minority group, a second model is trained through transfer learning without sampling. At time of inference, the output label is computed as a function of both models.\n\nThe proposed model is compared with the following alternative methods:\n\n(A)\nBasic CNN: VGGNet [85] CNN trained on entire data set.\n\n(B)\nDeep CNN features + SVM: Support vector machine (SVM) classifier trained with deep features generated by CNN.\n\n(C)\nTransfer learning without augmentation: Fine-tuned Inception-V3 with no data augmentation.\n\n(D)\nTransfer learning with augmentation: Fine-tuned Inception-V3 with data augmentation.\n\n(E)\nTransfer learning with balanced augmentation: Fine-tuned Inception-V3 with data augmentation that enforces class balanced training batches with over-sampling and under-sampling.\n\n(F)\nProposed model: Dynamic sampling, data augmentation, and transfer learning on Inception-V3 network.\n\nAverage class-wise F1-scores are compared across all 19 concepts, showing that the basic CNN performs the worst in all cases. The basic CNN was unable to classify a single instance correctly for several concepts with very high imbalance ratios, including Playground and Airport with imbalance ratios of \n and \n, respectively. Transfer learning methods (C\u2013E) performed significantly better than the baseline CNN, increasing the weighted average F1-score from 0.630 to as high as 0.779. Results in Table 6 show that the proposed method (F) outperforms all other models tested on the given data set. Compared to transfer learning with basic augmentation (D), the dynamic sampling method (F) improved the weighted average F1-score from 0.779 to 0.794.\n\nTable 6 Dynamic sampling with network camera image data [21]\nFull size table\nThe dynamic sampling method\u2019s ability to self-adjust sampling rates is its most attractive feature. This allows the method to adapt to different problems containing varying levels of complexity and class imbalance, with little to no hyperparameter tuning. By removing samples that have already been captured by the network parameters, gradient updates will be driven by the more difficult positive class samples. The dynamic sampling method outperforms a hybrid of over-sampling and under-sampling (E) according to F1-scores, but the details of the sampling method are not included in the description. We also do not know how dynamic sampling performs against plain RUS and ROS, as these methods were not tested. This should be examined closely in future works to determine if dynamic sampling can be used as a general replacement for RUS and ROS. One area of concern is the method\u2019s dependency on a validation set to calculate the class-wise performance metrics that are required to determine sampling rates. This will certainly be problematic in cases of class rarity, where very few positive samples exist, as setting aside data for validation may deprive the model of valuable training data. Methods for maximizing the total available training data should be included in future research. In addition, future research should extend the dynamic sampling method to non-CNN architectures and other domains.\n\nROS, RUS, and two-phase learning\nBuda et al. [23] compare ROS, RUS, and two-phase learning using three multi-class image data sets and deep CNNs. MNIST [86], CIFAR-10, and ImageNet data sets are used to create distributions with varying levels of imbalance. Both MNIST and CIFAR-10 training sets contain 50,000 images spread evenly across 10 classes, i.e. 5000 images per class. Imbalanced distributions were created from MNIST and CIFAR-10 in the range of \n and \n, respectively. The ImageNet training data, containing 100 classes with a maximum of 1000 samples per class, was used to create imbalanced distributions in the range of \n.\n\nA different CNN architecture was empirically selected for each data set based off recent state-of-the-art results. For the MNIST and CIFAR-10 experiments, a version of the LeNet-5 [58] and the All-CNN [87] architectures were used for classification, respectively. Baseline results were established for each CNN architecture by performing classification on the data sets without any form of class imbalance technique, i.e. no data sampling or thresholding. Next, seven different methods for addressing class imbalance were integrated with the CNN architectures and tested. ROC AUC was extended to the multi-class problem by averaging the one-versus-all AUC for each class, and used to compare the methods. A portion of their results are presented in Fig. 3.\n\nFig. 3\nfigure 3\nROS, RUS, and two-phase learning with MNIST (a\u2013c) and CIFAR-10 (d\u2013f) [23]\n\nFull size image\n(A)\nROS: All minority classes were over-sampled until class balance was achieved, where any class smaller than the largest class size is considered a minority class. In almost all experiments, over-sampling displayed the best performance, and never showed a decrease in performance when compared to the baseline.\n\n(B)\nRUS: All majority classes were under-sampled until class balance was achieved, where any class larger than the smallest class size is considered a majority class. RUS performed poorly when compared to the baseline models, and never displayed a notable advantage to ROS. RUS was comparable to ROS only when the total number of minority classes was very high, i.e. 80\u201390%.\n\n(C)\nTwo-phase training with ROS: The model is first pre-trained on a balanced data set which is generated through ROS, and then fine-tuned using the complete data set. In general, this method performed worse than strict ROS (A).\n\n(D)\nTwo-phase training with RUS: Similar to (C), except the balanced data set used for pre-training is generated through RUS. Results show that this approach was less effective than RUS (B).\n\n(E)\nThresholding with prior class probabilities: The network\u2019s decision threshold is adjusted during the test phase based on the prior probability of each class, effectively shifting the output class probabilities. Thresholding showed improvements to overall accuracy, especially when combined with ROS.\n\n(F)\nROS and thresholding: The thresholding method (E) is applied after training the model with a balanced data set, where the balanced data set is generated through ROS. Thresholding combined with ROS performed better than the baseline thresholding (E) in most cases.\n\n(G)\nRUS and thresholding: The thresholding method (E) is applied after training the model with a balanced data set, where the balanced data set is produced through RUS. Thresholding with RUS performed worse than (E) and (F) in all cases.\n\nThe work by Buda et al., which varies levels of class imbalance and problem complexity, is comprehensive, having trained almost 23,000 deep CNNs across three popular data sets. The impact of class imbalance was validated on a set of baseline CNNs, showing that classification performance is severely compromised as imbalance increases and that the impact of class imbalance seems to increase as problem complexity increases, e.g. CIFAR-10 versus MNIST. The authors conclude that ROS is the best overall method for addressing class imbalance, that RUS generally performs poorly, and that two-phase learning with ROS or RUS is not as effective as their plain ROS and RUS counterparts.\n\nWhile it does provide a reasonable high-level view of each method\u2019s performance, the multi-class ROC AUC score provides no insight into the underlying class-wise performance trade-offs. It is not clear if there is high variance in the class-wise scores, or if one extremely low class-wise score is causing a large drop in the average AUC score. We believe that additional performance metrics, including class-wise scores, will better explain the effectiveness of each method in addressing class imbalance and help guide practitioners in model selection.\n\nBuda et al. conclude that ROS should be performed until all class imbalance is eliminated. Despite their experimental results, we do not readily agree with this blanket statement, and argue that this is likely problem-dependent and requires further exploration. The MNIST data set, both relatively low in complexity and small in size, was used to demonstrate that over-sampling until all classes are balanced performs best. We do not know how well over-sampling to this level will perform on more complex data sets, or in problems containing big data or class rarity. Furthermore, over-sampling to this level of class balance in a big data problem can be extremely resource intensive, drastically increasing training time by introducing large volumes of redundant data.\n\nSummary of data-level methods\nTwo of the surveyed works [23, 79] have shown that eliminating class imbalance in the training data with ROS significantly improves classification results. Lee et al. have shown that pre-training DNNs with semi-balanced data generated through RUS or augmentation-based over-sampling improves minority group performance. In contrast to Lee et al., Buda et al. found that plain ROS and RUS generally perform better than two-phase learning. Unlike Lee et al., however, Buda et al. pre-trained their networks with data that was sampled until class balance was achieved. Since Lee et al. and Buda et al. used different imbalance levels for pre-training, and reported results with different performance metrics, it is difficult to understand the efficacy of two-phase learning. The dynamic sampling method outperformed baseline CNNs, but we do not know how it compares to ROS, RUS, or two-phase learning. Despite this limitation, the dynamic sampling method\u2019s ability to automatically adjust sampling rates throughout the training process is very appealing. Methods that can automatically adjust to varying levels of complexity and imbalance levels are favorable, as they reduce the number of tunable hyperparameters.\n\nThe experimental results suggest the use of ROS to eliminate class imbalance during the training of DNNs. This may be true for relatively small data sets, but we believe this will not hold true for problems containing big data or extreme class imbalance. Applying ROS until classes are balanced in very-large data sets, e.g. WHOI-Plankton data, will result in the duplication of large volumes of data and will drastically increase training times. RUS, on the other hand, reduces training time and may therefore be more practical in big data problems. We believe that RUS methods that remove redundant samples, reduce class noise, and strengthen class borders will prove helpful in these big data problems. Future work should explore these scenarios further.\n\nAll of the data-level methods presented were tested on class imbalanced image data with deep CNNs. In addition, differences in performance metrics and problem complexity make it difficult to compare methods directly. Future works should test these data-level methods on a variety of data types, imbalance levels, and DNN architectures. Multiple complementary performance metrics should be used to compare results, as this will better illustrate method trade-offs and guide future practitioners.\n\nAlgorithm-level methods\nThis section includes surveyed works that modify deep learning algorithms for the purpose of addressing class imbalance. These methods can be further divided into new loss functions, cost-sensitive learning, and threshold moving. Wang et al. [18] and Lin et al. [88] introduced new loss functions that allow the minority samples to contribute more to the loss. Wang et al. [89], Khan et al. [19], and Zhang et al. [90] experimented with cost-sensitive DNNs. The methods proposed by Khan et al. and  Zhang et al. have the advantage of learning cost matrices during training. The work by Buda et al. in the \"ROS, RUS, and two-phase learning\" section has also been included in this section, as they experimented with threshold adjusting. Zhang et al. [91] combine transfer learning, CNN feature extraction, and a cluster-based nearest neighbor rule to improve the classification of imbalanced image data. Finally, Ding et al. [92] experiment with very-deep CNNs to determine if increasing neural network depth improves convergence rates with imbalanced data.\n\nMean false error (MFE) loss\nWang et al. [18] found some success in modifying the loss function as they experimented with classifying imbalanced data with deep MLPs. A total of eight imbalanced binary data sets, including three image data sets and five text data sets, were generated from the CIFAR-100 [93] and 20 Newsgroup [94] collections. The data sets are all relatively small, with most training sets containing fewer than 2000 samples and the largest training set containing just 3500 samples. For each data set generated, imbalance ratios ranging from \n to \n were tested.\n\nThe authors first show that the mean squared error (MSE) loss function poorly captures the errors from the minority group in cases of high class imbalance, due to many negative samples dominating the loss function. They then propose two new loss functions that are more sensitive to the errors from the minority class, mean false error (MFE) and mean squared false error (MSFE). The proposed loss functions were derived by first splitting the MSE loss into two components, mean false positive error (FPE) and mean false negative error (FNE). The FPE (Eq. 12) and FNE (Eq. 13) values are then combined to define the total system loss, MFE (Eq. 14), as the sum of the mean error from each class.\n\nWang et al. introduce the MSFE loss (Eq. 15) as an improvement to the MFE loss, asserting that it better captures errors from the positive class. The MSFE can be expanded into the form \n, demonstrating how the optimization process minimizes the difference between FPE and FNE. The authors believe this improved version will better balance the error rates between the positive and negative classes.\n\n(12)\n(13)\n(14)\n(15)\nA deep MLP trained with the standard MSE loss is used as the baseline model. This same MLP architecture is then used to evaluate both the MFE and MSFE loss. Image classification results (Table 7) and text classification results (Table 8) show that the proposed models outperform the baseline in nearly all cases, with respect to F-measure and AUC scores.\n\nTable 7 CIFAR-100 classification with MFE and MSFE [18]\nFull size table\nTable 8 20 Newsgroup classification with MFE and MSFE[18]\nFull size table\nResults show that the MFE and MSFE loss functions outperform MSE loss in almost all cases. Improvements over the baseline MSE loss are most apparent when class imbalance is greatest, i.e. imbalance levels of 5%. The MFE and MSFE performance gains are also more pronounced on the image data than on the text data. For example, the MSFE loss improved the classification of Household image data, increasing the F1-score from 0.1143 to 0.2353 when the class imbalance level was 5%.\n\nBeing relatively easy to implement and integrate into existing models is one of the biggest advantages of using custom loss functions for addressing class imbalance. Unlike data-level methods that increase the size of the training set, the loss function is less likely to increase training times. The loss functions should generalize to other domains with ease, but as seen in comparing the image and text performance results, performance gains will vary from problem to problem. Additional experiments should be performed to validate MFE and MSFE effectiveness, as it is currently unclear how many rounds were conducted per experiment and the F1-score and AUC gains over the baseline are only minor improvements. On the image data experiments, for example, the average AUC gain over the baseline is just 0.025, with a median AUC gain over the baseline of only 0.008.\n\nFocal loss\nLin et al. [88] proposed a model that effectively addresses the extreme class imbalance commonly encountered in object detection problems, where positive foreground samples are heavily outnumbered by negative background samples. Two-stage and one-stage detectors are well-known methods for solving such problems, where the two-stage detectors typically achieve higher accuracy at the cost of increased computation time. Lin et al. set out to determine whether a fast single-stage detector was capable of achieving state-of-the-art results on par with current two-stage detectors. Through analysis of various two-stage detectors (e.g. R-CNN [95] and its successors) and one-stage detectors (e.g. SSD [96] and YOLO [97]), class imbalance was identified as the primary obstacle preventing one-stage detectors from achieving state-of-the-art performance. The overwhelming number of easily classified negative background candidates create imbalance ratios commonly in the range of \n, causing the negative class to account for the majority of the system\u2019s loss.\n\nTo combat these extreme imbalances, Lin et al. presented the focal loss (FL) (Eq. 16), which re-shapes the cross entropy (CE) loss in order to reduce the impact that easily classified samples have on the loss. This is achieved by multiplying the CE loss by a modulating factor, \n. Hyper parameter \n adjusts the rate at which easy examples are down weighted, and \n is a class-wise weight that is used to increase the importance of the minority class. Easily classified examples, where \n, cause the modulating factor to approach 0 and reduce the sample\u2019s impact on the loss.\n\n(16)\nThe proposed one-stage focal loss model, RetinaNet, is evaluated against several state-of-the-art one-stage and two-stage detectors. The RetinaNet model is composed of a backbone model and two subnetworks, where the backbone model is responsible for producing feature maps from the input image, and the two subnetworks then perform object classification and bounding box regression. The authors selected the feature pyramid network (FPN) [88], built on top of the ResNet architecture [98], as the backbone model and pre-trained it on ImageNet data. They found that the FPN CNN, which produces features at different scales, outperforms the plain ResNet in object detection. Two additional CNNs with separate parameters, the subnetworks, are then used to perform classification and bounding box regression. The proposed focal loss function is applied to the classification subnet, where the total loss is computed as the sum of the focal loss over all \n candidates. The COCO [99] data set was used to evaluate the proposed model against its competitors.\n\nThe first attempt to train RetinaNet using standard CE loss quickly fails and diverges due to the extreme imbalance. By initializing the last layer of the model such that the prior probability of detecting an object is \n, results improve significantly to an average precision (AP) of 30.2. Additional experiments are used to determine appropriate hyper parameters for the focal loss, selecting \n and \n for all remaining experiments.\n\nExperiments by Lin et al. show that the RetinaNet, with the proposed focal loss, is able to outperform existing one-stage and two-stage object detectors. It outscores the runner-up one-stage detector (DSSD513 [100]) and the best two-stage detector (Faster R-CNN with TDM [101]) by 7.6-point and 4.0-point AP gains, respectively. When compared to several online hard example mining (OHEM) [102] methods, RetinaNet outscores the best method with an increase in AP from 32.8 to 36.0. Table 9 compares results between RetinaNet and seven state-of-the-art one-stage and two-stage detectors.\n\nTable 9 RetinaNet (focal loss) on COCO [88]\nFull size table\nLin et al. provide additional information to illustrate the effectiveness of the focal loss method. In one experiment, they use a trained model to compute the focal loss over \n negative images and \n positive images. By plotting the cumulative distribution function for positive and negative samples, they show that as \n increases, more and more weight is placed onto a small subset of negative samples, i.e. the hard negatives. In fact, with \n, they show that most of the loss is derived from a very small fraction of samples, and that the focal loss is indeed reducing the impact of easily-classified negative samples on the loss. Run time statistics were included in the report to demonstrate that they were able to construct a fast one-stage detector capable of outperforming accurate two-stage detectors.\n\nThe new FL method lends itself to not just class imbalance problems, but also hard sample problems. It addresses the primary minority class gradient issue defined by Anand et al. by preventing the majority group from dominating the loss and allowing the minority group to contribute more to the weight updates. Similar to the MFE and MSFE loss functions, advantages include being relatively easy to integrate into existing models and having minimal impact on training time. We believe that the FL method\u2019s ability to down-weight easily-classified samples will allow it to generalize well to other domains. The authors compared FL directly to the CE loss, but we do not know how FL compares to other existing class imbalance methods. Future works should compare this loss function to alternative class imbalance methods across a variety of data sets and class imbalance levels.\n\nNemoto et al. [103] later used the focal loss in another image classification task, the automated detection of rare building changes, e.g. new construction. The airborne building images are annotated with the labels: no change, new construction, rebuilding, demolished, repaint roofs, and laying solar panel. The training data contains 203,358 images in total, where 200,000 comprise the negative class, i.e. no change. The repaint roofs and laying solar panel classes contain just 326 and 222 images, respectively, yielding class imbalance ratios as high as \n.\n\nThe experiments by Nemoto et al. utilize the VGG-16 [85] CNN architecture, where the baseline CNN uses the standard CE loss. Images were augmented by rotation and inversion, creating 20,000 samples per class. Class-wise accuracy on the validation set was used to compare the focal loss to the CE loss. The first experiment uses the CE loss function and shows that the accuracy on the repaint roof and laying solar panel classes begins to deteriorate after 25,000 iterations, suggesting over-fitting. In the second experiment, focal loss was evaluated using the same VGG-16 architecture and the same image augmentation procedure, generating 20,000 images per class. Unlike the first experiment, however, only three classes were selected for training and validation: no change, repaint roof, and laying solar panel images. The value of the focal loss\u2019s down-weighting parameter \n was varied in the range \n to better understand its impact.\n\nFig. 4\nfigure 4\nFocal loss and building change detection [103]\n\nFull size image\nFigure 4 shows the training validation loss and accuracy of the focal loss method. Nemoto et al. conclude that focal loss improves problems related to class imbalance and over-fitting by adjusting the per-class learning speed. By comparing the loss plots, it is clear that as \n increases, the total loss decreases faster and the model is slower to over-fit. It is not clear, however, if FL with \n is producing better classification results. First, the results from the first experiment cannot be compared to the results of the second experiment, because the total number of classes has been reduced from six to three, significantly reducing the complexity of the classification problem. Second, the results from the no change and laying solar panel classes in Fig. 4 show that the highest accuracy is achieved when \n, where the laying solar panel class is the smallest class. The focal loss, with \n, reduces to the standard cross entropy loss, suggesting that the CE loss outperforms the focal loss on two of the three classes in this experiment. To better understand the effectiveness of FL, future work should include a baseline with consistent training data, several alternative methods for addressing class imbalance, and additional performance metrics.\n\nCost-sensitive deep neural network (CSDNN)\nWang et al. [89] employed a cost-sensitive deep neural network (CSDNN) method to detect hospital readmissions, a class imbalanced problem where a small percentage of patients are readmitted to a hospital shortly after their original visit. Two data sets were provided by the Barnes-Jewish Hospital, containing patient records spanning from 2007 to 2011. The first data set, general hospital wards (GHW), contains vital signs, clinical processes, demographics, real-time bedside monitoring, and other electronic data sources. Of the 2565 records in GHW, 406 patients were readmitted within 30 days and 538 patients were readmitted within 60 days, producing imbalance ratios of \n and \n, respectively. The second data set, the operating room pilot data (ORP), contains vital signs, pre-operation data, laboratory tests, medical history, and procedure details. There are 700 records in the ORP data set, with 157 readmissions within 1 year and 124 readmissions within 30 days. The imbalance ratio of the ORP data is unclear; the authors merely state that the ORP data is less imbalanced than the GHW data (\n). A variety of performance metrics, including ROC, AUC, accuracy, recall, precision, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) are used for evaluation. The PPV and NPV metrics are equivalent to positive and negative class precision scores. The proposed CSDNN method was found to outperform existing hospital readmission prediction systems, and has been deployed at the Barnes-Jewish Hospital.\n\nInstead of representing categorical values with traditional one-hot encoding, Wang et al. use a categorical feature embedding approach to create more meaningful representations. In addition, they employed a CNN for automatic feature extraction from time series data, i.e. the patient vital signs data. The extracted features and categorical embeddings are concatenated, forming a final input feature vector that is fed to a DNN for classification. The DNN was composed of two hidden layers, with 128 and 64 neurons per layer. The CE loss function was modified to incorporate a pre-defined cost matrix, forcing the network to minimize misclassification cost. For the GHW data set, false negative errors were given a cost 2\u00d7 the cost of false positive errors. Similarly for the ORP data set, the false negative cost was set to 1.5\u00d7 the cost of false positive errors.\n\n Wang et al.\u2019s CSDNN method is compared to five baseline classifiers, including three decision tree methods, a SVM, and an ANN. Only one of the baseline methods addresses class imbalance, using under-sampling with a Random Forest (RF) classifier. The proposed method outperformed all of the baseline classifiers across all performance metrics except for NPV. We were able to observe the class-wise performance trade-off because multiple complementary performance metrics were reported. On the GHW data set, the CSDNN\u2019s AUC of 0.70 outscored the runner up\u2019s (ANN classifier) AUC of 0.62. Unfortunately, however, it is not possible to determine if the cost-sensitive loss function is the cause of the improved performance, as there are several other factors that may have contributed to improvements, e.g. categorical feature embedding and time-series feature extraction. A baseline that includes the CNN feature extractor and the categorical embeddings is required to isolate the efficacy of the cost-sensitive loss function.\n\nIncorporating the cost matrix into the CE loss is a minor implementation detail that should generalize well to other domains and architectures with minimal impact on training times. The process of identifying an ideal cost matrix is likely the biggest limitation. In traditional machine learning problems with relatively small data sets, models can be validated across a range of costs and the best cost matrix can be selected for the final model. When working with DNNs and large data sets, however, this process of searching for the best cost parameters can be very time consuming and even impractical. Including results from a range of cost matrices in future work will help to demonstrate the class-wise performance trade-offs that occur as costs vary.\n\nLearning cost matrices with cost-sensitive CNN (CoSen)\nKhan et al. [19] introduced an effective cost-sensitive deep learning procedure which jointly learns network weight parameters and class misclassification costs during training. The proposed method, CoSen CNN, is evaluated against six multi-class data sets with varying levels of imbalance: MNIST, CIFAR-100, Caltech-101 [104], MIT-67 [105], DIL [106], and MLC [107]. Class imbalance ratios of \n are tested for the MNIST, CIFAR-100, Caltech-101, and MIT-67 data sets. The DIL and MLC data sets have imbalance ratios of \n and \n, respectively. The VGG-16, pre-trained on ImageNet data, is used as a feature extractor and the baseline CNN throughout the experiments.\n\nThe cost matrix that is learned by the CoSen CNN is used to modify the output of the VGG-16 CNN\u2019s last layer, giving higher importance to samples with higher cost. The group presents three modified loss functions, incorporating the learned cost parameters into MSE loss, SVM hinge loss, and CE loss. The training process learns network weight parameters and misclassification cost parameters by keeping one fixed at a time, and minimizing cost with respect to the other during training. The cost matrix update is dependent on the current classification errors, the overall classification error, and the class-to-class separability (C2C). The C2C separability measures relationships between within-class sample distances and the size of class-separating boundaries.\n\nThe CoSen CNN is evaluated against the baseline CNN, multiple sampling methods, and multiple cost-sensitive methods. A two-layered neural network was used for the sampling classification methods, and a SVM and RF were used for the cost-sensitive methods. The SVM and RF baseline classifiers used the features that were extracted by the pre-trained VGG-16 CNN as input. The SOSR CNN is a cost-sensitive deep learning method that incorporates a fixed cost matrix into the loss function [108].\n\nOverall accuracy was used to show that the proposed CNN outperforms all seven alternative techniques across all data sets. Table 10 shows that the CoSen CNN performed exceptionally well, outperforming the runner-up classifier by more than 5% on CIFAR-100, Caltech-101, and MIT-67. The second best classifier listed in the experimental results is between the SOSR CNN and the baseline CNN. In all cases SMOTE outperformed RUS, and hybrid sampling method SMOTE-RSB [109] outperformed SMOTE. Unfortunately, with accuracy being the only performance metric reported between all seven class imbalance methods, and accuracy being unreliable in cases of class imbalance, these results may be misleading.\n\nTable 10 Cost-sensitive CoSen CNN results (accuracy) [19]\nFull size table\nF1 and G-Mean scores were reported to show that the proposed CoSen CNN outperforms the baseline CNN on all data sets, e.g. increasing the F1-score from 0.389 to 0.416 on the Caltech-101 data set. Khan et al. also included sample network training times, showing that the added cost parameter training increases each training epoch by several seconds but has little to no impact on the inference step. In another experiment, the authors defined three fixed cost matrices using class representation, data separability, and classification errors to derive the costs, and showed that the dynamic cost matrix method outperforms all three cases.\n\nIt is interesting that the baseline CNN, with no class imbalance modifications, is a close runner-up to the CoSen CNN, outperforming the sampling methods, SVM, and RF classifiers in all cases. This does not imply that a deep CNN with no class imbalance modifications is better equipped to address class imbalance than traditional sampling methods. Rather, this demonstrates the power of re-using strong feature extractors that have been trained on large volumes of data, e.g. over 1.3 million images in this experiment.\n\nAs mentioned previously, one of the difficulties of cost-sensitive learning is choosing an appropriate cost matrix, often requiring a domain expert or a grid search procedure. The CoSen method proposed by Khan et al. removes this requirement, and offers more of an end-to-end deep learning framework capable of learning from class imbalanced data. The authors report results on a number of experiments across a variety of data sets, and the joint learning of network parameters and cost parameters appears to be an excellent candidate for learning from class imbalanced data. Future experiments should explore this cost-sensitive method\u2019s ability to learn from problems containing alternative data types, big data, and class rarity.\n\nCost-sensitive DBN with differential evolution (CSDBN-DE)\nZhang et al. [90] set out to automatically learn costs for the purpose of cost-sensitive deep learning. More specifically, they use a differential evolutionary algorithm [110] to improve the cost matrix each training iteration, and incorporate these learned costs into a DBN. The proposed cost-sensitive deep belief network with differential evolution (CSDBN-DE) is evaluated against 42 data sets from the Knowledge Extraction based on Evolutionary Learning (KEEL) [111] repository. The training data sets are structured data sets, ranging in size from 171 samples to 3339 samples and containing between 6 and 13 attributes each. Imbalance ratios range from \n up to \n.\n\nThe DBN pre-training phase follows the original layer-wise training method first proposed by Hinton et al. [65]. The cost matrix is then incorporated into the output layer\u2019s softmax probabilities during the fine-tuning phase. Cost matrices are first randomly initialized, then training set evaluation scores are used to select a new cost matrix for the next population. Mutation and cross-over operations are applied to evolve and generate the next population of cost matrices. Once training is complete, the best cost matrix is selected and applied to the output layer of the DBN, forming the final version of the cost-sensitive DBN to be used for inference.\n\nAccuracy and error rate are used to compare the proposed method to an extreme learning machine (ELM) [112]. The ELM network is a type of single-hidden layer feedforward network that does not use backpropagation and is known to train thousands of times faster than neural networks. Experiments are repeated 20 times and results are averaged. The proposed CSDBN-DE model outperformed the ELM network on 28 out of 42 data sets, i.e. 66% of the experiments.\n\nSimilar to the CoSen CNN [19], the biggest advantage of the CSDBN-DE is its ability to learn an effective cost matrix throughout training, as this is often a difficult and time-consuming process. Unfortunately, it is not very clear how well the CSDBN-DE handles class imbalanced data, because it is compared to a single baseline built on a completely different architecture. Also, the accuracy performance metric provides no real insight into the network\u2019s true performance when class imbalance is present. The concept of incorporating an evolutionary algorithm to iteratively update a cost matrix shows promise, but more robust experiments are required to validate its ability to classify imbalanced data.\n\nOutput thresholding\nIn addition to the data sampling methods discussed in the \"ROS, RUS, and two-phase learning\" section, Buda et al. [23] experimented with adjusting CNN output thresholds to improve overall performance. They used the MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets with varying levels of class imbalance ratios in the range of \n and \n, respectively. Accuracy scores were used to compare thresholding with the baseline CNN, ROS, and RUS methods as they were described in the \"ROS, RUS, and two-phase learning\" section.\n\nThe authors applied thresholding by dividing the network outputs for each class by its estimated prior probability, effectively reducing the likelihood of misclassifying examples from the minority group. They also considered hybrid methods by combining threshold moving with RUS and ROS. The thresholding method outperformed the baseline CNN for all levels of class imbalance on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets. Thresholding outperformed ROS and RUS for all levels of imbalance on the MNIST data, but on the CIFAR-10 data there were several instances were ROS outperformed thresholding. Thresholding combined with ROS performed especially well, outperforming all other methods in nearly all cases.\n\nAs discussed in the \"ROS, RUS, and two-phase learning\" section, Buda et al. explored a variety of deep learning methods for addressing a wide range of class imbalance levels. They have shown that overall accuracy can be improved with threshold moving, and that it can be implemented relatively easily with prior class probabilities. Unfortunately, the accuracy score does not explain individual class-wise performances and trade-offs. Since thresholding is only applied during inference, it does not affect training times. This also means that thresholding does not impact weight tuning and therefore does not improve a model\u2019s ability to discriminate between classes. Regardless, it is still an appropriate method for reducing majority class bias that can be quickly implemented on top of an already trained network to improve classification results.\n\nCategory centers\nZhang et al. [91] experimented with deep representation learning of class imbalanced image data from the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 data sets. They present a method for addressing class imbalance, category centers (CC), that combines transfer learning, deep CNN feature extraction, and a nearest neighbor discriminator. Three class imbalanced distributions are created from each original data set through random under-sampling, i.e. Dist. A, Dist. B, and Dist. C. In Dist. A and Dist. B, half of the classes are reduced in size, creating imbalance levels of \n and \n, respectively. In Dist. C, class reduction levels increase linearly across all classes with a max imbalance of \n. For example, Dist. C for the CIFAR-100 data set contains 25 images in each of the first 10 classes, 75 images in each of the next 10 classes, then 125 images in each of the next 10 classes, etc. The proposed model is compared to both a baseline CNN and an over-sampling method. The mean precision performance metric is used to compare results.\n\nZhang et al. observe that similar images of the same class tend to cluster well in CNN deep feature space. They discuss the decision boundary that is created by the final layer of the CNN, the classification layer responsible for separating these deep feature clusters, stating that there is a greater chance for large errors in boundary placement when class imbalance is present. To avoid this boundary error in scenarios of class imbalance, they propose using high-level features extracted by the CNN to calculate each class\u2019s centroid in deep feature space. These category centers in deep feature space can then be used to classify new images, by assigning new images to their nearest deep feature category center. The VGG-16 network, pre-trained on ImageNet data, is used throughout the experiments as the baseline CNN. The proposed method fine-tunes the CNN on the imbalanced distribution, maps all images to their corresponding deep feature representations, then calculates the centroid for each class. At test time the trained CNN is used to extract features from new images, and each new image is assigned to the class of its nearest category center in feature space, defined by the Euclidean distance between the features.  Zhang et al. claim that the category center is significantly more stable than the boundary generated by a CNN\u2019s classification layer, but no evidence was provided to support this.\n\nTable 11 Category centers with CIFAR-10 data (AP) [91]\nFull size table\nA portion of  Zhang et al.\u2019s results are displayed in Table 11. The authors tried using two different CNN layers for feature extraction, the last convolutional layer (B) and the last fully connected layer (C), to determine if one set of features performed better. Finally, over-sampling was applied to the baseline and the category centers methods to determine the impact of data sampling on CC (D\u2013F). These results show that the CC methods (B, C) outperform the baseline CNN (A) on mean precision for all three imbalance scenarios. Results also show that the addition of over-sampling (D\u2013F) led to improved results on the CIFAR-10 distributions, with the exception of Dist. C. For example, the CC method with over-sampling (E) increased mean precision on Dist. A from a baseline (A) of 0.779 to 0.830. CIFAR-100 results were similar, in the sense that the proposed method (B, C) outperformed the baseline (A) for all three distributions. Unlike the CIFAR-10 data, interestingly, over-sampling did not improve the results of the proposed method when classifying the CIFAR-100 distributions, but it did improve the baseline CNN.\n\nWe believe that the biggest limitation to the CC method is that it is highly dependent on the DNN\u2019s ability to generate discriminative features that cluster well. If a large volume of class balanced, labelled training data is not available to pre-train the DNN, deep feature boundaries may not be strong enough to apply the CC method. The specifics of the over-sampling method used in methods (D\u2013F) are unknown, so we do not know if over-sampling was applied to a level of class balance or some other ratio. In addition, we do not know if these results are the average of several rounds of experiments, or are just results from a single instance. With no balanced distribution results, an unclear over-sampling method, and only one performance metric, it is difficult to understand how well the proposed CC method does in learning from class imbalance.\n\nVery-deep neural networks\nDing et al. [92] experimented with very-deep CNN architectures, e.g. 50 layers, to determine if deeper networks perform better on imbalanced data. The authors observe in literature that the error surfaces of deeper networks have better qualities for training convergence than smaller sized networks [113, 114]. They claim that larger networks contain more local minimum with good performance, making acceptable solutions easier to locate with gradient descent. The networks are tested on the problem of Facial Action Units (FAUs) recognition, i.e. the detection of basic facial actions as defined by the Facial Action Coding System [115].\n\nThe EmotioNet Challenge Track 1 data set [116] is used to compare methods. From the original data set, with over one million images, 450,000 images were randomly selected for training and 40,000 images were randomly selected for validation. The images in this data set contain 11 possible FAUs. Since an image can be positive for more than one FAU, the authors treated the classification problem as a set of 11 binary problems. Several FAUs are present in less than 1% of the data set, e.g. nose wrinkler, chin raiser, and upper lid raiser. The lip stretcher FAU is only present in 0.01% of the data, creating a max imbalance ratio to \n. Six deep CNN architectures are compared, all of which include \n convolution filter layers and are trained for 100 epochs:\n\n(A)\nHandcraft: 6-layer CNN\n\n(B)\nPlain34: 34-layer CNN\n\n(C)\nRes10: 10-layer ResNet CNN\n\n(D)\nRes18: 18-layer ResNet CNN\n\n(E)\nRes34: 34-layer ResNet CNN\n\n(F)\nRes50: 50-layer ResNet CNN.\n\nF1-scores from the first experiment are presented in Table 12. The shallow network (A) was unable to capture classes containing high imbalance, e.g. AU2\u2013AU5, during the 100 training epochs. The non-residual 34-layer CNN (B) saw a large boost in performance compared to the shallow network (A), with average F1-score increasing from 0.29 to 0.48. It can also be observed that the 10-layer ResNet (C) achieved an equal F1-score of 0.48. The FAU with the largest imbalance, i.e. lip stretcher (AU20), received an F1-score of 0.0 in all experiments. There is no noticeable difference in F1-scores between the networks with 10 layers or more (B\u2013F). The 34-layer ResNet (E) won first place at the first track EmotioNet Challenge in 2017 [116].\n\nTable 12 Comparing very-deep CNNs on FAU recognition (F1-score) [92]\nFull size table\nIn a second experiment, Ding et al. compare the convergence rate of a very-deep 18-layer CNN to a shallower 6-layer CNN across 100 epochs. The experiment shows that the very-deep 18-layer CNN converges faster than the shallower network, as the error decreases at a faster rate. The authors suggest that the shallower network will continue to converge, provided additional epochs.\n\nThe experiments by Ding et al. show that additional hidden layers can increase the convergence rate on facial action recognition. Training very-deep neural networks comes at a cost, however, as it increases the total number of matrix operations and the memory footprint. Additional experiments are required to determine if this increased convergence rate is observed with alternative deep learning architectures and data sets. With the convergence rate in question, other methods that have been shown to impact convergence rates should be included in future studies, e.g. alternative optimization methods, dynamic learning rates, and weight initialization.\n\nSummary of algorithm-level methods\nThis section included eight algorithm-level methods for addressing class imbalance with DNNs. The MFE and MSFE loss functions presented by Wang et al. outperform the standard MSE loss on several image and text data sets. Lin et al.\u2019s focal loss, which down-weights easy-to-classify samples, was used to outperform several state-of-the-art one-stage and two-stage object detectors on the COCO data set. Nemoto et al. also explored focal loss for the purpose of detecting rare building changes, but the results were somewhat contradictory. A cost-sensitive method that incorporates pre-defined misclassification costs into the CE loss function was used by  Wang et al. to predict hospital readmissions. Khan et al. proposed a cost-sensitive deep CNN (CoSen) that jointly learns network parameters and cost matrix parameters during training. Overall accuracy was used to show that the CoSen CNN outperforms a baseline CNN, multiple sampling methods, and multiple cost-sensitive methods consistently across six image data sets. Similarly,  Zhang et al. combined a DBN with an evolutionary algorithm that searches for optimal misclassification costs, but results were again reported with the accuracy metric and are difficult to interpret. Buda et al. demonstrated how prior class probabilities can be used to adjust DNN output thresholds to improve overall accuracy in classifying image data.  Zhang et al. presented category centers, a method that addresses class imbalance by combining transfer learning, deep CNN feature extraction, and a nearest deep feature cluster discrimination rule. Finally, Ding et al. experimented with very-deep neural networks (\n layers) and showed that deeper networks may converge faster due to changes in the error surfaces that allow for faster optimization.\n\nUnlike data sampling methods, the algorithm-level methods presented do not alter the training data and do not require any pre-processing steps. Compared to ROS, which was recommended by multiple authors in the  \"Data-level methods\" section, algorithm-level methods are less likely to impact training times. This suggests that algorithm-level methods may be better equipped for big data problems. With the exception of defining misclassification costs, the algorithm-level methods require little to no tuning. Fortunately, two methods were presented for automatically learning cost parameters. Methods which are able to adapt to different problems with minimal tuning are preferred, as they can be quickly applied to new problems and do not require specific domain knowledge. The focal loss function and CoSen CNN demonstrate this flexibility, and we believe they will generalize well to many complex problem domains.\"\nFrom the above paper, summarize and explain each method for tackling the imbalanced dataset problem in deep learning, and their pros and cons. Try to use your own words, do not copy the sentences directly from the above paper.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Addressing imbalanced datasets in deep learning involves various strategies to ensure models don't become biased towards majority classes. Here's a summary of the methods discussed, along with their pros and cons:\n\n### 1. Random Over-Sampling (ROS) and Random Under-Sampling (RUS)\n- **Pros**: Simple to implement; ROS can improve minority class recognition by duplicating its samples, while RUS reduces majority class size to balance the dataset.\n- **Cons**: ROS may lead to overfitting due to duplicate data; RUS might discard potentially useful information from the majority class.\n\n### 2. Data Augmentation\n- **Pros**: Enhances model generalization by introducing variations of training data, potentially making models robust to slight changes in input data.\n- **Cons**: Requires careful design to not introduce misleading data; can be computationally expensive.\n\n### 3. Two-Phase Learning\n- **Pros**: Utilizes a semi-balanced dataset for pre-training to improve minority class performance, preserving information across classes by fine-tuning on the full dataset later.\n- **Cons**: The efficacy of pre-training balance levels is variable; additional hyperparameters introduced by phase transitions may complicate training.\n\n### 4. Dynamic Sampling\n- **Pros**: Adaptively changes sampling rates based on class performance, focusing on difficult or underrepresented classes.\n- **Cons**: Reliance on a validation set for class performance metrics may be problematic in cases of extreme rarity.\n\n### 5. Modification of Loss Functions (Mean False Error, Focal Loss)\n- **Pros**: Custom loss functions can give more weight to errors in the minority class, potentially evening the importance between classes.\n- **Cons**: Designing and tuning custom loss functions can be complex and domain-specific.\n\n### 6. Cost-Sensitive Learning\n- **Pros**: Directly incorporates the cost of misclassification into the model training process, making it a more nuanced approach to balance class importance.\n- **Cons**: Determining the optimal cost matrix can be challenging and time-consuming without automated methods.\n\n### 7. Threshold Adjustment\n- **Pros**: Offers a simple post-training adjustment to classification thresholds that can improve performance metrics without retraining the model.\n- **Cons**: Does not alter the underlying model biases; effectiveness may vary depending on the model and dataset.\n\n### 8. Leveraging Deep Features for Classification\n- **Pros**: Utilizing deep features for determining \"category centers\" leverages CNNs' discriminative power to improve classification in imbalanced settings.\n- **Cons**: Dependent on the ability of the network to produce discriminatively useful features, which may not always be the case.\n\n### 9. Very-Deep Networks\n- **Pros**: Potentially faster convergence and improved classification of minority classes due to richer feature hierarchies.\n- **Cons**: Significant increase in computational resources and training time; benefits may diminish after a certain depth.\n\n### General Observations on Pros and Cons:\n\n- **Pros across Methods**: Many strategies (e.g., dynamic sampling, two-phase learning) are designed to directly confront the challenge of imbalanced datasets by modifying the training process to be more attentive to the minority classes.\n- **Cons across Methods**: Complexity, increased computational resources, and the potential for overfitting or losing valuable information are common drawbacks. Furthermore, the efficacy of many techniques depends on the specific dataset and domain, requiring careful tuning and validation.\n\nIn conclusion, addressing imbalanced datasets in deep learning requires a nuanced approach that may combine multiple strategies. The choice of method depends on the specific problem, the available computational resources, and the desired balance between precision and recall."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user provided a detailed academic discussion on class imbalance in deep learning, which required careful parsing and contextual understanding to generate an accurate and relevant response.

Hensman and Masko [79] first show that balancing the training data with ROS can improve the classification of imbalanced image data. Then RUS and augmentation methods are used by Lee et al. [20] to decrease class imbalance for the purpose of pre-training a deep CNN. Pouyanfar et al. [21] introduce a new dynamic sampling method that adjusts sampling rates according to class-wise performance. Finally, Buda et al. [23] compare RUS, ROS, and two-phase learning across multiple imbalanced image data sets.\n\nBalancing training data with ROS\nHensman and Masko [79] explored the effects of class imbalance and ROS using deep CNNs. The CIFAR-10 [80] benchmark data set, comprised of 10 classes with 6000 images per class, was used to generate 10 imbalanced data sets for testing. These 10 generated data sets contained varying class sizes, ranging between 6% and 15% of the total data set, producing a max imbalance ratio \n. In addition to varying the class size, the different distributions also varied the number of minority classes, where a minority class is any class smaller than the largest class. For example, a major 50\u201350 split (Dist. 3) reduced five of the classes to 6% of the data set size and increased five of the classes to 14%. As another example, a major singular over-representation (Dist. 5) increased the size of the airplane class to 14.5%, reducing the other nine classes slightly to 9.5%.\n\nA variant of the AlexNet [17] CNN, which has proven to perform well on CIFAR-10, was used for all experiments by Hensman and Masko. The baseline performance was defined by training the CNN on all distributions with no data sampling. The ROS method being evaluated consisted of randomly duplicating samples from the minority classes until all classes in the training set had an equal number of samples.\n\nHensman and Masko presented their results as the percentage of correct answers per class, and included the mean score for all classes, denoted by Total. To ensure results were valid, a total of three runs were completed for each experiment and then averaged. Table 3 shows the results of the CNN without any data sampling. These results demonstrate the impact of class imbalance when training a CNN model. Most of the imbalanced distributions saw a loss in performance. Dist. 6 and Dist. 7, which contained very slight imbalance and no over-representation, performed just as well as the original balanced distribution. Some of the imbalanced distributions that contained over-represented classes, e.g. Dist. 5 and Dist. 9, yielded useless models that were completely biased towards the majority group.\n\nTable 4 includes the results of training the CNN with balanced data that was generated through ROS. It shows that over-sampling performs significantly better than the baseline results from Table 3. Dist. 1 is excluded from Table 4 because it is already balanced, i.e. ROS is not applicable. In this experiment, ROS improved the classification results for all distributions. Dist. 5 and Dist. 9 saw the largest performance gains, increasing from baseline Total F1-scores of 0.10 up to 0.73 and 0.72, respectively. The ROS classification results for distributions Dist. 2\u2013Dist. 11 are comparable to the results achieved by the baseline CNN on Dist. 1, suggesting that ROS has completely restored model performance.\n\nTable 3 Imbalanced CIFAR-10 classification [79]\nFull size table\nTable 4 Imbalanced CIFAR-10 classification with ROS [79]\nFull size table\nThe experiments by Hensman and Masko show that applying ROS to the level of class balance can be effective in addressing slight class imbalance in image data. It is also made clear by some of the results in Table 3 that small levels of imbalance are able to prevent a CNN from converging to an acceptable solution. We believe that the low imbalance levels tested (\n) is the biggest limitation of this experiment, as imbalance levels are typically much higher in practice. Besides exploring additional data sets and higher levels of imbalance, one area worth pursuing further is the total number of epochs completed during training on the imbalanced data. In these experiments, only 10 epochs over the training data were completed because the authors were more interested in comparing performance than they were in achieving high performance. Running additional epochs would help to rule out whether or not the poor performance was due to the slow convergence phenomenon described by Anand et al.\n\nAt the time of writing, May 2015, Hensman and Masko observed no existing research that examined the impact of class imbalance on deep learning with popular benchmark data sets. Our literature review also finds this to be true, confirming that addressing class imbalance with deep learning is still relatively immature and understudied.\n\nTwo-phase learning\nLee et al. [20] combined RUS with transfer learning to classify highly-imbalanced data sets of plankton images, WHOI-Plankton [81]. The data set contains 3.4 million images spread over 103 classes, with 90% of the images comprised of just five classes and the 5th largest class making up just 1.3% of the entire data set. Imbalance ratios of \n are exhibited in the data set, with many classes making up less than 0.1% of the data set. The proposed method is the two-phase learning procedure, where a deep CNN is first pre-trained with thresholded data, and then fine-tuned using all data. The thresholded data sets for pre-training are constructed by randomly under-sampling large classes until they reach a threshold of N examples. The authors selected a threshold of \n through preliminary experiments, then down-sampled all large classes to N samples. The proposed model (G) was compared to six alternative methods (A\u2013F), a combination of transfer learning and augmentation techniques, using unweighted average F1-scores to compare results.\n\n(A)\nFull: CNN trained with original imbalanced data set.\n\n(B)\nNoise: CNN trained with augmented data, where minority classes are duplicated through noise injection until all classes contain at least 1000 samples.\n\n(C)\nAug: CNN trained with augmented data, where minority classes are duplicated through rotation, scaling, translation, and flipping of images until all classes contain at least 1000 samples.\n\n(D)\nThresh: CNN trained with thresholded data, generated through random under-sampling until all classes have at most 5000 samples.\n\n(E)\nNoise + full: CNN pre-trained with the noise-augmented data from (B), then fine-tuned using the full data set.\n\n(F)\nAug + full: CNN pre-trained with the transform-augmented data from (C), then fine-tuned using the full data set.\n\n(G)\nThresh + full: CNN pre-trained using the thresholded data set from (D), then fine-tuned using the full imbalanced data set.\n\nResults from Lee et al.\u2019s experiments are presented in Table 5, where the L5 and Rest columns are the unweighted average F1-scores for the largest five classes and the remaining minority classes, respectively. Comparing methods (B\u2013D) shows that under-sampling (D) outperforms both noise injection (B) and augmentation (C) over-sampling methods on the given data set for all classes. Methods (B\u2013D) saw moderate improvements on the Rest group when compared to the baseline (A), but the L5 group suffered sufficient loss in performance. Re-training the model with the full data set in (E\u2013G) allowed the models to re-capture the distribution of the L5 group. The proposed model (G) achieved the highest F1-score (0.7791) on the L5 group, and greatly improved the F1-score of the Rest group from 0.1548 to 0.3262 with respect to the baseline.\n\nTable 5 Two-phase learning with WHOI-Plankton (Avg. F1-score) [20]\nFull size table\nThe two-phase learning procedure presented by Lee et al. has proven effective in increasing the minority class performance while still preserving the majority class performance. Unlike plain RUS, which completely removes potentially useful information from the training set, the two-phase learning method only removes samples from the majority group during the pre-training phase. This allows the minority group to contribute more to the gradient during pre-training, and still allows the model to see all of the available data during the fine-tuning phase. The authors did not include details on the pre-training phase, such as the number of pre-training epochs or the criteria used to determine when pre-training was complete. These details should be considered in future works, as pre-training that results in high bias or high variance will certainly impact the final model\u2019s class-wise performance. Future work can also consider a hybrid approach, where the model is pre-trained with data that is generated through a combination of under-sampling majority classes and augmenting minority classes.\n\nThe previous year, Havaei et al. [82] used a similar two-phase learning procedure to manage class imbalance when performing brain tumor image segmentation. The brain tumor data contains minority classes that make up less than 1% of the total data set. Havaei et al. stated that the two-phase learning procedure was critical in dealing with the imbalanced distribution in their image data. The details of this paper are not included in this survey because the two-phase learning is just one small component of their domain-specific experiments.\n\nDynamic sampling\nPouyanfar et al. [21] used a dynamic sampling technique to perform classification of imbalanced image data with a deep CNN. The basic idea is to over-sample the low performing classes and under-sample the high performing classes, showing the model less of what it has already learned and more of what it does not understand yet. This is somewhat analogous to how humans learn, by moving on from easy tasks once learned and focusing attention on the more difficult tasks. The author\u2019s self-collected data set contains over 10,000 images captured from publicly available network cameras, including a total of 19 semantic concepts, e.g. intersection, forest, farm, sky, water, playground, and park. From the original data set, 70% is used for training models, 20% is used for validation, and 10% is set aside for testing. The authors report imbalance ratios in the data set as high as \n. Average F1-scores and weighted average F1-scores are used to compare the proposed model to a baseline CNN (A) and four alternative methods for handling class imbalance (B\u2013E).\n\nThe system presented by Pouyanfar et al. includes three core components: real time data augmentation, transfer learning, and a novel dynamic sampling method. Real time data augmentation improves generalization by applying various transformations to select images in each training batch. Transfer learning is achieved by fine-tuning an Inception-V3 network [83] that was pre-trained using ImageNet [84] data. The dynamic sampling method is the main contribution relative to class imbalance.\n\n(11)\n is a vector containing all individual class F1-scores after iteration i, and \n denotes the F1-score for class j on iteration i, where F1-scores are calculated for each class in a one-versus-all manner. During the next iteration, classes with lower F1-scores are sampled at a higher rate, forcing the learner to focus more on examples previously misclassified. Eq. 11 is used to obtain the next iteration\u2019s sample size for a given class \n, where \n is the average class size. To prevent over-fitting of the minority group, a second model is trained through transfer learning without sampling. At time of inference, the output label is computed as a function of both models.\n\nThe proposed model is compared with the following alternative methods:\n\n(A)\nBasic CNN: VGGNet [85] CNN trained on entire data set.\n\n(B)\nDeep CNN features + SVM: Support vector machine (SVM) classifier trained with deep features generated by CNN.\n\n(C)\nTransfer learning without augmentation: Fine-tuned Inception-V3 with no data augmentation.\n\n(D)\nTransfer learning with augmentation: Fine-tuned Inception-V3 with data augmentation.\n\n(E)\nTransfer learning with balanced augmentation: Fine-tuned Inception-V3 with data augmentation that enforces class balanced training batches with over-sampling and under-sampling.\n\n(F)\nProposed model: Dynamic sampling, data augmentation, and transfer learning on Inception-V3 network.\n\nAverage class-wise F1-scores are compared across all 19 concepts, showing that the basic CNN performs the worst in all cases. The basic CNN was unable to classify a single instance correctly for several concepts with very high imbalance ratios, including Playground and Airport with imbalance ratios of \n and \n, respectively. Transfer learning methods (C\u2013E) performed significantly better than the baseline CNN, increasing the weighted average F1-score from 0.630 to as high as 0.779. Results in Table 6 show that the proposed method (F) outperforms all other models tested on the given data set. Compared to transfer learning with basic augmentation (D), the dynamic sampling method (F) improved the weighted average F1-score from 0.779 to 0.794.\n\nTable 6 Dynamic sampling with network camera image data [21]\nFull size table\nThe dynamic sampling method\u2019s ability to self-adjust sampling rates is its most attractive feature. This allows the method to adapt to different problems containing varying levels of complexity and class imbalance, with little to no hyperparameter tuning. By removing samples that have already been captured by the network parameters, gradient updates will be driven by the more difficult positive class samples. The dynamic sampling method outperforms a hybrid of over-sampling and under-sampling (E) according to F1-scores, but the details of the sampling method are not included in the description. We also do not know how dynamic sampling performs against plain RUS and ROS, as these methods were not tested. This should be examined closely in future works to determine if dynamic sampling can be used as a general replacement for RUS and ROS. One area of concern is the method\u2019s dependency on a validation set to calculate the class-wise performance metrics that are required to determine sampling rates. This will certainly be problematic in cases of class rarity, where very few positive samples exist, as setting aside data for validation may deprive the model of valuable training data. Methods for maximizing the total available training data should be included in future research. In addition, future research should extend the dynamic sampling method to non-CNN architectures and other domains.\n\nROS, RUS, and two-phase learning\nBuda et al. [23] compare ROS, RUS, and two-phase learning using three multi-class image data sets and deep CNNs. MNIST [86], CIFAR-10, and ImageNet data sets are used to create distributions with varying levels of imbalance. Both MNIST and CIFAR-10 training sets contain 50,000 images spread evenly across 10 classes, i.e. 5000 images per class. Imbalanced distributions were created from MNIST and CIFAR-10 in the range of \n and \n, respectively. The ImageNet training data, containing 100 classes with a maximum of 1000 samples per class, was used to create imbalanced distributions in the range of \n.\n\nA different CNN architecture was empirically selected for each data set based off recent state-of-the-art results. For the MNIST and CIFAR-10 experiments, a version of the LeNet-5 [58] and the All-CNN [87] architectures were used for classification, respectively. Baseline results were established for each CNN architecture by performing classification on the data sets without any form of class imbalance technique, i.e. no data sampling or thresholding. Next, seven different methods for addressing class imbalance were integrated with the CNN architectures and tested. ROC AUC was extended to the multi-class problem by averaging the one-versus-all AUC for each class, and used to compare the methods. A portion of their results are presented in Fig. 3.\n\nFig. 3\nfigure 3\nROS, RUS, and two-phase learning with MNIST (a\u2013c) and CIFAR-10 (d\u2013f) [23]\n\nFull size image\n(A)\nROS: All minority classes were over-sampled until class balance was achieved, where any class smaller than the largest class size is considered a minority class. In almost all experiments, over-sampling displayed the best performance, and never showed a decrease in performance when compared to the baseline.\n\n(B)\nRUS: All majority classes were under-sampled until class balance was achieved, where any class larger than the smallest class size is considered a majority class. RUS performed poorly when compared to the baseline models, and never displayed a notable advantage to ROS. RUS was comparable to ROS only when the total number of minority classes was very high, i.e. 80\u201390%.\n\n(C)\nTwo-phase training with ROS: The model is first pre-trained on a balanced data set which is generated through ROS, and then fine-tuned using the complete data set. In general, this method performed worse than strict ROS (A).\n\n(D)\nTwo-phase training with RUS: Similar to (C), except the balanced data set used for pre-training is generated through RUS. Results show that this approach was less effective than RUS (B).\n\n(E)\nThresholding with prior class probabilities: The network\u2019s decision threshold is adjusted during the test phase based on the prior probability of each class, effectively shifting the output class probabilities. Thresholding showed improvements to overall accuracy, especially when combined with ROS.\n\n(F)\nROS and thresholding: The thresholding method (E) is applied after training the model with a balanced data set, where the balanced data set is generated through ROS. Thresholding combined with ROS performed better than the baseline thresholding (E) in most cases.\n\n(G)\nRUS and thresholding: The thresholding method (E) is applied after training the model with a balanced data set, where the balanced data set is produced through RUS. Thresholding with RUS performed worse than (E) and (F) in all cases.\n\nThe work by Buda et al., which varies levels of class imbalance and problem complexity, is comprehensive, having trained almost 23,000 deep CNNs across three popular data sets. The impact of class imbalance was validated on a set of baseline CNNs, showing that classification performance is severely compromised as imbalance increases and that the impact of class imbalance seems to increase as problem complexity increases, e.g. CIFAR-10 versus MNIST. The authors conclude that ROS is the best overall method for addressing class imbalance, that RUS generally performs poorly, and that two-phase learning with ROS or RUS is not as effective as their plain ROS and RUS counterparts.\n\nWhile it does provide a reasonable high-level view of each method\u2019s performance, the multi-class ROC AUC score provides no insight into the underlying class-wise performance trade-offs. It is not clear if there is high variance in the class-wise scores, or if one extremely low class-wise score is causing a large drop in the average AUC score. We believe that additional performance metrics, including class-wise scores, will better explain the effectiveness of each method in addressing class imbalance and help guide practitioners in model selection.\n\nBuda et al. conclude that ROS should be performed until all class imbalance is eliminated. Despite their experimental results, we do not readily agree with this blanket statement, and argue that this is likely problem-dependent and requires further exploration. The MNIST data set, both relatively low in complexity and small in size, was used to demonstrate that over-sampling until all classes are balanced performs best. We do not know how well over-sampling to this level will perform on more complex data sets, or in problems containing big data or class rarity. Furthermore, over-sampling to this level of class balance in a big data problem can be extremely resource intensive, drastically increasing training time by introducing large volumes of redundant data.\n\nSummary of data-level methods\nTwo of the surveyed works [23, 79] have shown that eliminating class imbalance in the training data with ROS significantly improves classification results. Lee et al. have shown that pre-training DNNs with semi-balanced data generated through RUS or augmentation-based over-sampling improves minority group performance. In contrast to Lee et al., Buda et al. found that plain ROS and RUS generally perform better than two-phase learning. Unlike Lee et al., however, Buda et al. pre-trained their networks with data that was sampled until class balance was achieved. Since Lee et al. and Buda et al. used different imbalance levels for pre-training, and reported results with different performance metrics, it is difficult to understand the efficacy of two-phase learning. The dynamic sampling method outperformed baseline CNNs, but we do not know how it compares to ROS, RUS, or two-phase learning. Despite this limitation, the dynamic sampling method\u2019s ability to automatically adjust sampling rates throughout the training process is very appealing. Methods that can automatically adjust to varying levels of complexity and imbalance levels are favorable, as they reduce the number of tunable hyperparameters.\n\nThe experimental results suggest the use of ROS to eliminate class imbalance during the training of DNNs. This may be true for relatively small data sets, but we believe this will not hold true for problems containing big data or extreme class imbalance. Applying ROS until classes are balanced in very-large data sets, e.g. WHOI-Plankton data, will result in the duplication of large volumes of data and will drastically increase training times. RUS, on the other hand, reduces training time and may therefore be more practical in big data problems. We believe that RUS methods that remove redundant samples, reduce class noise, and strengthen class borders will prove helpful in these big data problems. Future work should explore these scenarios further.\n\nAll of the data-level methods presented were tested on class imbalanced image data with deep CNNs. In addition, differences in performance metrics and problem complexity make it difficult to compare methods directly. Future works should test these data-level methods on a variety of data types, imbalance levels, and DNN architectures. Multiple complementary performance metrics should be used to compare results, as this will better illustrate method trade-offs and guide future practitioners.\n\nAlgorithm-level methods\nThis section includes surveyed works that modify deep learning algorithms for the purpose of addressing class imbalance. These methods can be further divided into new loss functions, cost-sensitive learning, and threshold moving. Wang et al. [18] and Lin et al. [88] introduced new loss functions that allow the minority samples to contribute more to the loss. Wang et al. [89], Khan et al. [19], and Zhang et al. [90] experimented with cost-sensitive DNNs. The methods proposed by Khan et al. and  Zhang et al. have the advantage of learning cost matrices during training. The work by Buda et al. in the \"ROS, RUS, and two-phase learning\" section has also been included in this section, as they experimented with threshold adjusting. Zhang et al. [91] combine transfer learning, CNN feature extraction, and a cluster-based nearest neighbor rule to improve the classification of imbalanced image data. Finally, Ding et al. [92] experiment with very-deep CNNs to determine if increasing neural network depth improves convergence rates with imbalanced data.\n\nMean false error (MFE) loss\nWang et al. [18] found some success in modifying the loss function as they experimented with classifying imbalanced data with deep MLPs. A total of eight imbalanced binary data sets, including three image data sets and five text data sets, were generated from the CIFAR-100 [93] and 20 Newsgroup [94] collections. The data sets are all relatively small, with most training sets containing fewer than 2000 samples and the largest training set containing just 3500 samples. For each data set generated, imbalance ratios ranging from \n to \n were tested.\n\nThe authors first show that the mean squared error (MSE) loss function poorly captures the errors from the minority group in cases of high class imbalance, due to many negative samples dominating the loss function. They then propose two new loss functions that are more sensitive to the errors from the minority class, mean false error (MFE) and mean squared false error (MSFE). The proposed loss functions were derived by first splitting the MSE loss into two components, mean false positive error (FPE) and mean false negative error (FNE). The FPE (Eq. 12) and FNE (Eq. 13) values are then combined to define the total system loss, MFE (Eq. 14), as the sum of the mean error from each class.\n\nWang et al. introduce the MSFE loss (Eq. 15) as an improvement to the MFE loss, asserting that it better captures errors from the positive class. The MSFE can be expanded into the form \n, demonstrating how the optimization process minimizes the difference between FPE and FNE. The authors believe this improved version will better balance the error rates between the positive and negative classes.\n\n(12)\n(13)\n(14)\n(15)\nA deep MLP trained with the standard MSE loss is used as the baseline model. This same MLP architecture is then used to evaluate both the MFE and MSFE loss. Image classification results (Table 7) and text classification results (Table 8) show that the proposed models outperform the baseline in nearly all cases, with respect to F-measure and AUC scores.\n\nTable 7 CIFAR-100 classification with MFE and MSFE [18]\nFull size table\nTable 8 20 Newsgroup classification with MFE and MSFE[18]\nFull size table\nResults show that the MFE and MSFE loss functions outperform MSE loss in almost all cases. Improvements over the baseline MSE loss are most apparent when class imbalance is greatest, i.e. imbalance levels of 5%. The MFE and MSFE performance gains are also more pronounced on the image data than on the text data. For example, the MSFE loss improved the classification of Household image data, increasing the F1-score from 0.1143 to 0.2353 when the class imbalance level was 5%.\n\nBeing relatively easy to implement and integrate into existing models is one of the biggest advantages of using custom loss functions for addressing class imbalance. Unlike data-level methods that increase the size of the training set, the loss function is less likely to increase training times. The loss functions should generalize to other domains with ease, but as seen in comparing the image and text performance results, performance gains will vary from problem to problem. Additional experiments should be performed to validate MFE and MSFE effectiveness, as it is currently unclear how many rounds were conducted per experiment and the F1-score and AUC gains over the baseline are only minor improvements. On the image data experiments, for example, the average AUC gain over the baseline is just 0.025, with a median AUC gain over the baseline of only 0.008.\n\nFocal loss\nLin et al. [88] proposed a model that effectively addresses the extreme class imbalance commonly encountered in object detection problems, where positive foreground samples are heavily outnumbered by negative background samples. Two-stage and one-stage detectors are well-known methods for solving such problems, where the two-stage detectors typically achieve higher accuracy at the cost of increased computation time. Lin et al. set out to determine whether a fast single-stage detector was capable of achieving state-of-the-art results on par with current two-stage detectors. Through analysis of various two-stage detectors (e.g. R-CNN [95] and its successors) and one-stage detectors (e.g. SSD [96] and YOLO [97]), class imbalance was identified as the primary obstacle preventing one-stage detectors from achieving state-of-the-art performance. The overwhelming number of easily classified negative background candidates create imbalance ratios commonly in the range of \n, causing the negative class to account for the majority of the system\u2019s loss.\n\nTo combat these extreme imbalances, Lin et al. presented the focal loss (FL) (Eq. 16), which re-shapes the cross entropy (CE) loss in order to reduce the impact that easily classified samples have on the loss. This is achieved by multiplying the CE loss by a modulating factor, \n. Hyper parameter \n adjusts the rate at which easy examples are down weighted, and \n is a class-wise weight that is used to increase the importance of the minority class. Easily classified examples, where \n, cause the modulating factor to approach 0 and reduce the sample\u2019s impact on the loss.\n\n(16)\nThe proposed one-stage focal loss model, RetinaNet, is evaluated against several state-of-the-art one-stage and two-stage detectors. The RetinaNet model is composed of a backbone model and two subnetworks, where the backbone model is responsible for producing feature maps from the input image, and the two subnetworks then perform object classification and bounding box regression. The authors selected the feature pyramid network (FPN) [88], built on top of the ResNet architecture [98], as the backbone model and pre-trained it on ImageNet data. They found that the FPN CNN, which produces features at different scales, outperforms the plain ResNet in object detection. Two additional CNNs with separate parameters, the subnetworks, are then used to perform classification and bounding box regression. The proposed focal loss function is applied to the classification subnet, where the total loss is computed as the sum of the focal loss over all \n candidates. The COCO [99] data set was used to evaluate the proposed model against its competitors.\n\nThe first attempt to train RetinaNet using standard CE loss quickly fails and diverges due to the extreme imbalance. By initializing the last layer of the model such that the prior probability of detecting an object is \n, results improve significantly to an average precision (AP) of 30.2. Additional experiments are used to determine appropriate hyper parameters for the focal loss, selecting \n and \n for all remaining experiments.\n\nExperiments by Lin et al. show that the RetinaNet, with the proposed focal loss, is able to outperform existing one-stage and two-stage object detectors. It outscores the runner-up one-stage detector (DSSD513 [100]) and the best two-stage detector (Faster R-CNN with TDM [101]) by 7.6-point and 4.0-point AP gains, respectively. When compared to several online hard example mining (OHEM) [102] methods, RetinaNet outscores the best method with an increase in AP from 32.8 to 36.0. Table 9 compares results between RetinaNet and seven state-of-the-art one-stage and two-stage detectors.\n\nTable 9 RetinaNet (focal loss) on COCO [88]\nFull size table\nLin et al. provide additional information to illustrate the effectiveness of the focal loss method. In one experiment, they use a trained model to compute the focal loss over \n negative images and \n positive images. By plotting the cumulative distribution function for positive and negative samples, they show that as \n increases, more and more weight is placed onto a small subset of negative samples, i.e. the hard negatives. In fact, with \n, they show that most of the loss is derived from a very small fraction of samples, and that the focal loss is indeed reducing the impact of easily-classified negative samples on the loss. Run time statistics were included in the report to demonstrate that they were able to construct a fast one-stage detector capable of outperforming accurate two-stage detectors.\n\nThe new FL method lends itself to not just class imbalance problems, but also hard sample problems. It addresses the primary minority class gradient issue defined by Anand et al. by preventing the majority group from dominating the loss and allowing the minority group to contribute more to the weight updates. Similar to the MFE and MSFE loss functions, advantages include being relatively easy to integrate into existing models and having minimal impact on training time. We believe that the FL method\u2019s ability to down-weight easily-classified samples will allow it to generalize well to other domains. The authors compared FL directly to the CE loss, but we do not know how FL compares to other existing class imbalance methods. Future works should compare this loss function to alternative class imbalance methods across a variety of data sets and class imbalance levels.\n\nNemoto et al. [103] later used the focal loss in another image classification task, the automated detection of rare building changes, e.g. new construction. The airborne building images are annotated with the labels: no change, new construction, rebuilding, demolished, repaint roofs, and laying solar panel. The training data contains 203,358 images in total, where 200,000 comprise the negative class, i.e. no change. The repaint roofs and laying solar panel classes contain just 326 and 222 images, respectively, yielding class imbalance ratios as high as \n.\n\nThe experiments by Nemoto et al. utilize the VGG-16 [85] CNN architecture, where the baseline CNN uses the standard CE loss. Images were augmented by rotation and inversion, creating 20,000 samples per class. Class-wise accuracy on the validation set was used to compare the focal loss to the CE loss. The first experiment uses the CE loss function and shows that the accuracy on the repaint roof and laying solar panel classes begins to deteriorate after 25,000 iterations, suggesting over-fitting. In the second experiment, focal loss was evaluated using the same VGG-16 architecture and the same image augmentation procedure, generating 20,000 images per class. Unlike the first experiment, however, only three classes were selected for training and validation: no change, repaint roof, and laying solar panel images. The value of the focal loss\u2019s down-weighting parameter \n was varied in the range \n to better understand its impact.\n\nFig. 4\nfigure 4\nFocal loss and building change detection [103]\n\nFull size image\nFigure 4 shows the training validation loss and accuracy of the focal loss method. Nemoto et al. conclude that focal loss improves problems related to class imbalance and over-fitting by adjusting the per-class learning speed. By comparing the loss plots, it is clear that as \n increases, the total loss decreases faster and the model is slower to over-fit. It is not clear, however, if FL with \n is producing better classification results. First, the results from the first experiment cannot be compared to the results of the second experiment, because the total number of classes has been reduced from six to three, significantly reducing the complexity of the classification problem. Second, the results from the no change and laying solar panel classes in Fig. 4 show that the highest accuracy is achieved when \n, where the laying solar panel class is the smallest class. The focal loss, with \n, reduces to the standard cross entropy loss, suggesting that the CE loss outperforms the focal loss on two of the three classes in this experiment. To better understand the effectiveness of FL, future work should include a baseline with consistent training data, several alternative methods for addressing class imbalance, and additional performance metrics.\n\nCost-sensitive deep neural network (CSDNN)\nWang et al. [89] employed a cost-sensitive deep neural network (CSDNN) method to detect hospital readmissions, a class imbalanced problem where a small percentage of patients are readmitted to a hospital shortly after their original visit. Two data sets were provided by the Barnes-Jewish Hospital, containing patient records spanning from 2007 to 2011. The first data set, general hospital wards (GHW), contains vital signs, clinical processes, demographics, real-time bedside monitoring, and other electronic data sources. Of the 2565 records in GHW, 406 patients were readmitted within 30 days and 538 patients were readmitted within 60 days, producing imbalance ratios of \n and \n, respectively. The second data set, the operating room pilot data (ORP), contains vital signs, pre-operation data, laboratory tests, medical history, and procedure details. There are 700 records in the ORP data set, with 157 readmissions within 1 year and 124 readmissions within 30 days. The imbalance ratio of the ORP data is unclear; the authors merely state that the ORP data is less imbalanced than the GHW data (\n). A variety of performance metrics, including ROC, AUC, accuracy, recall, precision, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) are used for evaluation. The PPV and NPV metrics are equivalent to positive and negative class precision scores. The proposed CSDNN method was found to outperform existing hospital readmission prediction systems, and has been deployed at the Barnes-Jewish Hospital.\n\nInstead of representing categorical values with traditional one-hot encoding, Wang et al. use a categorical feature embedding approach to create more meaningful representations. In addition, they employed a CNN for automatic feature extraction from time series data, i.e. the patient vital signs data. The extracted features and categorical embeddings are concatenated, forming a final input feature vector that is fed to a DNN for classification. The DNN was composed of two hidden layers, with 128 and 64 neurons per layer. The CE loss function was modified to incorporate a pre-defined cost matrix, forcing the network to minimize misclassification cost. For the GHW data set, false negative errors were given a cost 2\u00d7 the cost of false positive errors. Similarly for the ORP data set, the false negative cost was set to 1.5\u00d7 the cost of false positive errors.\n\n Wang et al.\u2019s CSDNN method is compared to five baseline classifiers, including three decision tree methods, a SVM, and an ANN. Only one of the baseline methods addresses class imbalance, using under-sampling with a Random Forest (RF) classifier. The proposed method outperformed all of the baseline classifiers across all performance metrics except for NPV. We were able to observe the class-wise performance trade-off because multiple complementary performance metrics were reported. On the GHW data set, the CSDNN\u2019s AUC of 0.70 outscored the runner up\u2019s (ANN classifier) AUC of 0.62. Unfortunately, however, it is not possible to determine if the cost-sensitive loss function is the cause of the improved performance, as there are several other factors that may have contributed to improvements, e.g. categorical feature embedding and time-series feature extraction. A baseline that includes the CNN feature extractor and the categorical embeddings is required to isolate the efficacy of the cost-sensitive loss function.\n\nIncorporating the cost matrix into the CE loss is a minor implementation detail that should generalize well to other domains and architectures with minimal impact on training times. The process of identifying an ideal cost matrix is likely the biggest limitation. In traditional machine learning problems with relatively small data sets, models can be validated across a range of costs and the best cost matrix can be selected for the final model. When working with DNNs and large data sets, however, this process of searching for the best cost parameters can be very time consuming and even impractical. Including results from a range of cost matrices in future work will help to demonstrate the class-wise performance trade-offs that occur as costs vary.\n\nLearning cost matrices with cost-sensitive CNN (CoSen)\nKhan et al. [19] introduced an effective cost-sensitive deep learning procedure which jointly learns network weight parameters and class misclassification costs during training. The proposed method, CoSen CNN, is evaluated against six multi-class data sets with varying levels of imbalance: MNIST, CIFAR-100, Caltech-101 [104], MIT-67 [105], DIL [106], and MLC [107]. Class imbalance ratios of \n are tested for the MNIST, CIFAR-100, Caltech-101, and MIT-67 data sets. The DIL and MLC data sets have imbalance ratios of \n and \n, respectively. The VGG-16, pre-trained on ImageNet data, is used as a feature extractor and the baseline CNN throughout the experiments.\n\nThe cost matrix that is learned by the CoSen CNN is used to modify the output of the VGG-16 CNN\u2019s last layer, giving higher importance to samples with higher cost. The group presents three modified loss functions, incorporating the learned cost parameters into MSE loss, SVM hinge loss, and CE loss. The training process learns network weight parameters and misclassification cost parameters by keeping one fixed at a time, and minimizing cost with respect to the other during training. The cost matrix update is dependent on the current classification errors, the overall classification error, and the class-to-class separability (C2C). The C2C separability measures relationships between within-class sample distances and the size of class-separating boundaries.\n\nThe CoSen CNN is evaluated against the baseline CNN, multiple sampling methods, and multiple cost-sensitive methods. A two-layered neural network was used for the sampling classification methods, and a SVM and RF were used for the cost-sensitive methods. The SVM and RF baseline classifiers used the features that were extracted by the pre-trained VGG-16 CNN as input. The SOSR CNN is a cost-sensitive deep learning method that incorporates a fixed cost matrix into the loss function [108].\n\nOverall accuracy was used to show that the proposed CNN outperforms all seven alternative techniques across all data sets. Table 10 shows that the CoSen CNN performed exceptionally well, outperforming the runner-up classifier by more than 5% on CIFAR-100, Caltech-101, and MIT-67. The second best classifier listed in the experimental results is between the SOSR CNN and the baseline CNN. In all cases SMOTE outperformed RUS, and hybrid sampling method SMOTE-RSB [109] outperformed SMOTE. Unfortunately, with accuracy being the only performance metric reported between all seven class imbalance methods, and accuracy being unreliable in cases of class imbalance, these results may be misleading.\n\nTable 10 Cost-sensitive CoSen CNN results (accuracy) [19]\nFull size table\nF1 and G-Mean scores were reported to show that the proposed CoSen CNN outperforms the baseline CNN on all data sets, e.g. increasing the F1-score from 0.389 to 0.416 on the Caltech-101 data set. Khan et al. also included sample network training times, showing that the added cost parameter training increases each training epoch by several seconds but has little to no impact on the inference step. In another experiment, the authors defined three fixed cost matrices using class representation, data separability, and classification errors to derive the costs, and showed that the dynamic cost matrix method outperforms all three cases.\n\nIt is interesting that the baseline CNN, with no class imbalance modifications, is a close runner-up to the CoSen CNN, outperforming the sampling methods, SVM, and RF classifiers in all cases. This does not imply that a deep CNN with no class imbalance modifications is better equipped to address class imbalance than traditional sampling methods. Rather, this demonstrates the power of re-using strong feature extractors that have been trained on large volumes of data, e.g. over 1.3 million images in this experiment.\n\nAs mentioned previously, one of the difficulties of cost-sensitive learning is choosing an appropriate cost matrix, often requiring a domain expert or a grid search procedure. The CoSen method proposed by Khan et al. removes this requirement, and offers more of an end-to-end deep learning framework capable of learning from class imbalanced data. The authors report results on a number of experiments across a variety of data sets, and the joint learning of network parameters and cost parameters appears to be an excellent candidate for learning from class imbalanced data. Future experiments should explore this cost-sensitive method\u2019s ability to learn from problems containing alternative data types, big data, and class rarity.\n\nCost-sensitive DBN with differential evolution (CSDBN-DE)\nZhang et al. [90] set out to automatically learn costs for the purpose of cost-sensitive deep learning. More specifically, they use a differential evolutionary algorithm [110] to improve the cost matrix each training iteration, and incorporate these learned costs into a DBN. The proposed cost-sensitive deep belief network with differential evolution (CSDBN-DE) is evaluated against 42 data sets from the Knowledge Extraction based on Evolutionary Learning (KEEL) [111] repository. The training data sets are structured data sets, ranging in size from 171 samples to 3339 samples and containing between 6 and 13 attributes each. Imbalance ratios range from \n up to \n.\n\nThe DBN pre-training phase follows the original layer-wise training method first proposed by Hinton et al. [65]. The cost matrix is then incorporated into the output layer\u2019s softmax probabilities during the fine-tuning phase. Cost matrices are first randomly initialized, then training set evaluation scores are used to select a new cost matrix for the next population. Mutation and cross-over operations are applied to evolve and generate the next population of cost matrices. Once training is complete, the best cost matrix is selected and applied to the output layer of the DBN, forming the final version of the cost-sensitive DBN to be used for inference.\n\nAccuracy and error rate are used to compare the proposed method to an extreme learning machine (ELM) [112]. The ELM network is a type of single-hidden layer feedforward network that does not use backpropagation and is known to train thousands of times faster than neural networks. Experiments are repeated 20 times and results are averaged. The proposed CSDBN-DE model outperformed the ELM network on 28 out of 42 data sets, i.e. 66% of the experiments.\n\nSimilar to the CoSen CNN [19], the biggest advantage of the CSDBN-DE is its ability to learn an effective cost matrix throughout training, as this is often a difficult and time-consuming process. Unfortunately, it is not very clear how well the CSDBN-DE handles class imbalanced data, because it is compared to a single baseline built on a completely different architecture. Also, the accuracy performance metric provides no real insight into the network\u2019s true performance when class imbalance is present. The concept of incorporating an evolutionary algorithm to iteratively update a cost matrix shows promise, but more robust experiments are required to validate its ability to classify imbalanced data.\n\nOutput thresholding\nIn addition to the data sampling methods discussed in the \"ROS, RUS, and two-phase learning\" section, Buda et al. [23] experimented with adjusting CNN output thresholds to improve overall performance. They used the MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets with varying levels of class imbalance ratios in the range of \n and \n, respectively. Accuracy scores were used to compare thresholding with the baseline CNN, ROS, and RUS methods as they were described in the \"ROS, RUS, and two-phase learning\" section.\n\nThe authors applied thresholding by dividing the network outputs for each class by its estimated prior probability, effectively reducing the likelihood of misclassifying examples from the minority group. They also considered hybrid methods by combining threshold moving with RUS and ROS. The thresholding method outperformed the baseline CNN for all levels of class imbalance on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets. Thresholding outperformed ROS and RUS for all levels of imbalance on the MNIST data, but on the CIFAR-10 data there were several instances were ROS outperformed thresholding. Thresholding combined with ROS performed especially well, outperforming all other methods in nearly all cases.\n\nAs discussed in the \"ROS, RUS, and two-phase learning\" section, Buda et al. explored a variety of deep learning methods for addressing a wide range of class imbalance levels. They have shown that overall accuracy can be improved with threshold moving, and that it can be implemented relatively easily with prior class probabilities. Unfortunately, the accuracy score does not explain individual class-wise performances and trade-offs. Since thresholding is only applied during inference, it does not affect training times. This also means that thresholding does not impact weight tuning and therefore does not improve a model\u2019s ability to discriminate between classes. Regardless, it is still an appropriate method for reducing majority class bias that can be quickly implemented on top of an already trained network to improve classification results.\n\nCategory centers\nZhang et al. [91] experimented with deep representation learning of class imbalanced image data from the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 data sets. They present a method for addressing class imbalance, category centers (CC), that combines transfer learning, deep CNN feature extraction, and a nearest neighbor discriminator. Three class imbalanced distributions are created from each original data set through random under-sampling, i.e. Dist. A, Dist. B, and Dist. C. In Dist. A and Dist. B, half of the classes are reduced in size, creating imbalance levels of \n and \n, respectively. In Dist. C, class reduction levels increase linearly across all classes with a max imbalance of \n. For example, Dist. C for the CIFAR-100 data set contains 25 images in each of the first 10 classes, 75 images in each of the next 10 classes, then 125 images in each of the next 10 classes, etc. The proposed model is compared to both a baseline CNN and an over-sampling method. The mean precision performance metric is used to compare results.\n\nZhang et al. observe that similar images of the same class tend to cluster well in CNN deep feature space. They discuss the decision boundary that is created by the final layer of the CNN, the classification layer responsible for separating these deep feature clusters, stating that there is a greater chance for large errors in boundary placement when class imbalance is present. To avoid this boundary error in scenarios of class imbalance, they propose using high-level features extracted by the CNN to calculate each class\u2019s centroid in deep feature space. These category centers in deep feature space can then be used to classify new images, by assigning new images to their nearest deep feature category center. The VGG-16 network, pre-trained on ImageNet data, is used throughout the experiments as the baseline CNN. The proposed method fine-tunes the CNN on the imbalanced distribution, maps all images to their corresponding deep feature representations, then calculates the centroid for each class. At test time the trained CNN is used to extract features from new images, and each new image is assigned to the class of its nearest category center in feature space, defined by the Euclidean distance between the features.  Zhang et al. claim that the category center is significantly more stable than the boundary generated by a CNN\u2019s classification layer, but no evidence was provided to support this.\n\nTable 11 Category centers with CIFAR-10 data (AP) [91]\nFull size table\nA portion of  Zhang et al.\u2019s results are displayed in Table 11. The authors tried using two different CNN layers for feature extraction, the last convolutional layer (B) and the last fully connected layer (C), to determine if one set of features performed better. Finally, over-sampling was applied to the baseline and the category centers methods to determine the impact of data sampling on CC (D\u2013F). These results show that the CC methods (B, C) outperform the baseline CNN (A) on mean precision for all three imbalance scenarios. Results also show that the addition of over-sampling (D\u2013F) led to improved results on the CIFAR-10 distributions, with the exception of Dist. C. For example, the CC method with over-sampling (E) increased mean precision on Dist. A from a baseline (A) of 0.779 to 0.830. CIFAR-100 results were similar, in the sense that the proposed method (B, C) outperformed the baseline (A) for all three distributions. Unlike the CIFAR-10 data, interestingly, over-sampling did not improve the results of the proposed method when classifying the CIFAR-100 distributions, but it did improve the baseline CNN.\n\nWe believe that the biggest limitation to the CC method is that it is highly dependent on the DNN\u2019s ability to generate discriminative features that cluster well. If a large volume of class balanced, labelled training data is not available to pre-train the DNN, deep feature boundaries may not be strong enough to apply the CC method. The specifics of the over-sampling method used in methods (D\u2013F) are unknown, so we do not know if over-sampling was applied to a level of class balance or some other ratio. In addition, we do not know if these results are the average of several rounds of experiments, or are just results from a single instance. With no balanced distribution results, an unclear over-sampling method, and only one performance metric, it is difficult to understand how well the proposed CC method does in learning from class imbalance.\n\nVery-deep neural networks\nDing et al. [92] experimented with very-deep CNN architectures, e.g. 50 layers, to determine if deeper networks perform better on imbalanced data. The authors observe in literature that the error surfaces of deeper networks have better qualities for training convergence than smaller sized networks [113, 114]. They claim that larger networks contain more local minimum with good performance, making acceptable solutions easier to locate with gradient descent. The networks are tested on the problem of Facial Action Units (FAUs) recognition, i.e. the detection of basic facial actions as defined by the Facial Action Coding System [115].\n\nThe EmotioNet Challenge Track 1 data set [116] is used to compare methods. From the original data set, with over one million images, 450,000 images were randomly selected for training and 40,000 images were randomly selected for validation. The images in this data set contain 11 possible FAUs. Since an image can be positive for more than one FAU, the authors treated the classification problem as a set of 11 binary problems. Several FAUs are present in less than 1% of the data set, e.g. nose wrinkler, chin raiser, and upper lid raiser. The lip stretcher FAU is only present in 0.01% of the data, creating a max imbalance ratio to \n. Six deep CNN architectures are compared, all of which include \n convolution filter layers and are trained for 100 epochs:\n\n(A)\nHandcraft: 6-layer CNN\n\n(B)\nPlain34: 34-layer CNN\n\n(C)\nRes10: 10-layer ResNet CNN\n\n(D)\nRes18: 18-layer ResNet CNN\n\n(E)\nRes34: 34-layer ResNet CNN\n\n(F)\nRes50: 50-layer ResNet CNN.\n\nF1-scores from the first experiment are presented in Table 12. The shallow network (A) was unable to capture classes containing high imbalance, e.g. AU2\u2013AU5, during the 100 training epochs. The non-residual 34-layer CNN (B) saw a large boost in performance compared to the shallow network (A), with average F1-score increasing from 0.29 to 0.48. It can also be observed that the 10-layer ResNet (C) achieved an equal F1-score of 0.48. The FAU with the largest imbalance, i.e. lip stretcher (AU20), received an F1-score of 0.0 in all experiments. There is no noticeable difference in F1-scores between the networks with 10 layers or more (B\u2013F). The 34-layer ResNet (E) won first place at the first track EmotioNet Challenge in 2017 [116].\n\nTable 12 Comparing very-deep CNNs on FAU recognition (F1-score) [92]\nFull size table\nIn a second experiment, Ding et al. compare the convergence rate of a very-deep 18-layer CNN to a shallower 6-layer CNN across 100 epochs. The experiment shows that the very-deep 18-layer CNN converges faster than the shallower network, as the error decreases at a faster rate. The authors suggest that the shallower network will continue to converge, provided additional epochs.\n\nThe experiments by Ding et al. show that additional hidden layers can increase the convergence rate on facial action recognition. Training very-deep neural networks comes at a cost, however, as it increases the total number of matrix operations and the memory footprint. Additional experiments are required to determine if this increased convergence rate is observed with alternative deep learning architectures and data sets. With the convergence rate in question, other methods that have been shown to impact convergence rates should be included in future studies, e.g. alternative optimization methods, dynamic learning rates, and weight initialization.\n\nSummary of algorithm-level methods\nThis section included eight algorithm-level methods for addressing class imbalance with DNNs. The MFE and MSFE loss functions presented by Wang et al. outperform the standard MSE loss on several image and text data sets. Lin et al.\u2019s focal loss, which down-weights easy-to-classify samples, was used to outperform several state-of-the-art one-stage and two-stage object detectors on the COCO data set. Nemoto et al. also explored focal loss for the purpose of detecting rare building changes, but the results were somewhat contradictory. A cost-sensitive method that incorporates pre-defined misclassification costs into the CE loss function was used by  Wang et al. to predict hospital readmissions. Khan et al. proposed a cost-sensitive deep CNN (CoSen) that jointly learns network parameters and cost matrix parameters during training. Overall accuracy was used to show that the CoSen CNN outperforms a baseline CNN, multiple sampling methods, and multiple cost-sensitive methods consistently across six image data sets. Similarly,  Zhang et al. combined a DBN with an evolutionary algorithm that searches for optimal misclassification costs, but results were again reported with the accuracy metric and are difficult to interpret. Buda et al. demonstrated how prior class probabilities can be used to adjust DNN output thresholds to improve overall accuracy in classifying image data.  Zhang et al. presented category centers, a method that addresses class imbalance by combining transfer learning, deep CNN feature extraction, and a nearest deep feature cluster discrimination rule. Finally, Ding et al. experimented with very-deep neural networks (\n layers) and showed that deeper networks may converge faster due to changes in the error surfaces that allow for faster optimization.\n\nUnlike data sampling methods, the algorithm-level methods presented do not alter the training data and do not require any pre-processing steps. Compared to ROS, which was recommended by multiple authors in the  \"Data-level methods\" section, algorithm-level methods are less likely to impact training times. This suggests that algorithm-level methods may be better equipped for big data problems. With the exception of defining misclassification costs, the algorithm-level methods require little to no tuning. Fortunately, two methods were presented for automatically learning cost parameters. Methods which are able to adapt to different problems with minimal tuning are preferred, as they can be quickly applied to new problems and do not require specific domain knowledge. The focal loss function and CoSen CNN demonstrate this flexibility, and we believe they will generalize well to many complex problem domains.\"\nFrom the above paper, summarize and explain each method for tackling the imbalanced dataset problem in deep learning, and their pros and cons.

Common approaches for addressing data imbalance\nVarious methods have been developed to handle the class imbalance problem that can be broadly divided into two main approaches: Data driven and algorithm driven. The former attempts to balance the class distribution [8]. The latter approach adjusts the learning algorithm, or the classifier without amending the training set [10]. In the next sub-sections, we briefly review these approaches and reveal their advantage and disadvantages.\n\n3.1. Data driven approaches\nData driven approaches adjust the class ratio in the input dataset to achieve balanced class distribution. This approach often employs sampling techniques like under-sampling, oversampling, or a combination of both [2].\n\n3.1.1. Under-sampling\nThe primary under-sampling technique that arbitrarily eliminates examples of the majority class to balance the dataset is known as random under-sampling [28]. Researchers such as [18] reveal the primary drawback associated with this method to be the disposal of useful information that can prove to be crucial in the later classification stages. Many under-sampling approaches have been proposed such as Condensed Nearest Neighbour Rule (CNN), Wilson Edited Nearest Neighbour Rule (ENN), Neighbourhood Cleaning Rule (NCL), Tomek Links, and One-sided selection (OSS) [20], [29], [43], [44].\n\nWilson [44], proposes the CNN method in which if the class label of any example is different from the class of at least two of its nearest three neighbours, then the example is eliminated from the dataset. Tomek [43] proposed the Tomek Links method, which is a modified CNN that considers only the data points close to the boundary to be important. In this method two samples, Ei and Ej, belonging to two different classes are considered together with the distance D(Ei, Ej) between them. The Tomek Link method states that if there does not exist an example E0 such that D(Ei, E0)\u202f<\u202fD(Ei, Ej) or D(Ej, E0)\u202f<\u202fD(Ei, Ej) then pair (Ei, Ej) is a Tomek Link. The formation of a Tomek Link implies the existence of a noisy example or else examples on the borderline [5]. The majority class examples in such Tomek Links are removed to address the class imbalance problem.\n\nLaurikkala [29] proposes the NCL method which utilizes three nearest neighbours for each example (Ei) in the training dataset. When Ei belongs to the majority class, and its three nearest neighbours have a different class, then Ei is removed. However, if Ei belongs to the minority class and its three nearest neighbours are different than those neighbours that belong to the majority class, then they are removed. The drawback of this method is that it can lead to an enormous number of computations when the input dataset is large and comprises a large number of majority class instances [10]. Anwar [5] highlights another drawback in the ENN and NCL methods, which is class overlapping. The author states that when the degree of class overlapping in the training set is high, then the classifier built will be poor in terms of predictive accuracy, as the majority class examples situated close to the decision boundaries will be deleted. Tomek Links is similar to NCL in that it may lead to performance deterioration of the classifiers when the input dataset is large and with a high degree of overlapping among class values.\n\nJohnson and Khoshgoftaar [25] surveyed different approaches to class imbalance related to Artificial Neural Networks The authors studied unstructured datasets such as images and text. Their research addressed issues related to experimental design, implementation and evaluation of deep learning techniques in applications that are linked with data imbalance such as medical diagnosis and fraud detection, among others. Challenges related to complexity, output format, results and learning mechanisms have been discussed in the survey especially within the context of deep learning. The authors concluded that the class imbalance problem has not been sufficiently covered within deep learning and believed their approach could help improve the performance when the input data is imbalanced. Aytu\u011f Onan [48] proposed an under-sampling technique based on consensus clustering to improve performance of imbalanced datasets. In using this approach, observations linked with the dominant class in the training dataset are under-sampled using the consensus clustering algorithm. Several different small imbalanced datasets and two large datasets were utilized to test the new under-sampling technique. In the experiments, different classification algorithms including Nave Bayes and Regression among others have been used to derive classifiers and show the impact of the proposed under-sampling technique. The results reported by the classification algorithms when using the consensus clustering method in the pre-processing phase yielded better predictive accuracy on the datasets when compared to not using sampling techniques.\n\n3.1.2. Oversampling\nOversampling is another common sampling approach used to deal with an imbalanced class problem. Various oversampling strategies are available including random oversampling, focused oversampling, and synthetic sampling [11], [13], [27]. The method in which the instances of the minority class are randomly replicated until they have equal representation is known as random oversampling [8]. Random oversampling has two major shortcomings: it increases the possibility of overfitting of the classifier on the training dataset, and if the original data already has high dimensionality, it mounts the computation cost thus increasing the training time of the classifier [10]. In focused oversampling, only those minority class values with samples occurring on the boundary between the majority and minority class values are resampled. However, Chawla et al. [11] state that these methods of oversampling by replication lead to a more specific decision region of the minority class. To overcome this and broaden this decision region, they propose an advanced heuristic oversampling technique called the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). SMOTE is a technique in which oversampling of the minority class is carried out by generating synthetic examples. These new synthetic minority class examples are the result of interpolation between closely located minority class samples. Chawla et al. [11] describe the process of SMOTE as calculating the nearest same-class neighbours for every minority example and then based on the required oversampling rate, randomly choosing from these neighbouring examples. The synthetic examples are then generated at random points along the line segments joining the minority examples with these chosen neighbours. This process expands the decision region pertaining to the minority class. The authors tested SMOTE on a wide variety of datasets with different training sizes and degree of imbalance. It was observed that the larger and less specific decision regions of SMOTE resulted in this method outperforming oversampling by replacement.\n\n3.2. Algorithm-driven approach\nIn this approach, the classification algorithm is adjusted to facilitate the learning task specifically with respect to the minority class. In this approach, no changes are made to the input data distribution. This approach includes cost sensitive learning, thresholding, and hybrid methods like ensemble learners among others.\n\n3.2.1. Cost-sensitive learning\nThe basic assumption by any traditional classification algorithm is that there is a cost of misclassification is the same for all response variable values [10], [14]. However, in real world applications the cost of misclassification may vary among target class values. For example, in the field of medical diagnosis predicting that a person suffers from a particular disease when he does not will lead to more medical examinations. On other hand, misclassifying a person as healthy when he actually suffers from the disease can lead to excessive health costs and potential fatality. In this situation, the cost of misclassification is higher, so the classifier ought to be sensitive to the type of application and more importantly the cost associated with misclassification [8], [35]. To address this issue, cost-sensitive learning was proposed, so if the underlying dataset has a class ratio of 1:3 favouring the majority class, then the misclassifying cost for the minority class will be three times that of the majority class [24]. An important concept in cost-sensitive learning is the Cost Matrix [8] which comprises the average cost of misclassification for each available class. The goal of this method is to minimize misclassification cost by choosing a class with minimum conditional risk [28].

Thresholding methods\nThresholding is a method used to address the problem of class imbalance in classification at the algorithmic level.

Certain algorithms, like Nave Bayes, generate probability estimates that are converted into predictions by cutting off at the threshold which is usually 0.5 (Radwan [35]). The predicted class label depends on the associated probability lying above or below the threshold. However, when the class is imbalanced the performance of many classifiers is affected and thus the decision threshold of the classifiers needs to be adjusted such that the cost of misclassifications is reduced, and the prediction performance is improved.\n\nZou et al.

Common approaches for addressing data imbalance\nVarious methods have been developed to handle the class imbalance problem that can be broadly divided into two main approaches: Data driven and algorithm driven. The former attempts to balance the class distribution [8]. The latter approach adjusts the learning algorithm, or the classifier without amending the training set [10]. In the next sub-sections, we briefly review these approaches and reveal their advantage and disadvantages.\n\n3.1. Data driven approaches\nData driven approaches adjust the class ratio in the input dataset to achieve balanced class distribution. This approach often employs sampling techniques like under-sampling, oversampling, or a combination of both [2].\n\n3.1.1. Under-sampling\nThe primary under-sampling technique that arbitrarily eliminates examples of the majority class to balance the dataset is known as random under-sampling [28]. Researchers such as [18] reveal the primary drawback associated with this method to be the disposal of useful information that can prove to be crucial in the later classification stages. Many under-sampling approaches have been proposed such as Condensed Nearest Neighbour Rule (CNN), Wilson Edited Nearest Neighbour Rule (ENN), Neighbourhood Cleaning Rule (NCL), Tomek Links, and One-sided selection (OSS) [20], [29], [43], [44].\n\nWilson [44], proposes the CNN method in which if the class label of any example is different from the class of at least two of its nearest three neighbours, then the example is eliminated from the dataset. Tomek [43] proposed the Tomek Links method, which is a modified CNN that considers only the data points close to the boundary to be important. In this method two samples, Ei and Ej, belonging to two different classes are considered together with the distance D(Ei, Ej) between them. The Tomek Link method states that if there does not exist an example E0 such that D(Ei, E0)\u202f<\u202fD(Ei, Ej) or D(Ej, E0)\u202f<\u202fD(Ei, Ej) then pair (Ei, Ej) is a Tomek Link. The formation of a Tomek Link implies the existence of a noisy example or else examples on the borderline [5]. The majority class examples in such Tomek Links are removed to address the class imbalance problem.\n\nLaurikkala [29] proposes the NCL method which utilizes three nearest neighbours for each example (Ei) in the training dataset. When Ei belongs to the majority class, and its three nearest neighbours have a different class, then Ei is removed. However, if Ei belongs to the minority class and its three nearest neighbours are different than those neighbours that belong to the majority class, then they are removed. The drawback of this method is that it can lead to an enormous number of computations when the input dataset is large and comprises a large number of majority class instances [10]. Anwar [5] highlights another drawback in the ENN and NCL methods, which is class overlapping. The author states that when the degree of class overlapping in the training set is high, then the classifier built will be poor in terms of predictive accuracy, as the majority class examples situated close to the decision boundaries will be deleted. Tomek Links is similar to NCL in that it may lead to performance deterioration of the classifiers when the input dataset is large and with a high degree of overlapping among class values.\n\nJohnson and Khoshgoftaar [25] surveyed different approaches to class imbalance related to Artificial Neural Networks The authors studied unstructured datasets such as images and text. Their research addressed issues related to experimental design, implementation and evaluation of deep learning techniques in applications that are linked with data imbalance such as medical diagnosis and fraud detection, among others. Challenges related to complexity, output format, results and learning mechanisms have been discussed in the survey especially within the context of deep learning. The authors concluded that the class imbalance problem has not been sufficiently covered within deep learning and believed their approach could help improve the performance when the input data is imbalanced. Aytu\u011f Onan [48] proposed an under-sampling technique based on consensus clustering to improve performance of imbalanced datasets. In using this approach, observations linked with the dominant class in the training dataset are under-sampled using the consensus clustering algorithm. Several different small imbalanced datasets and two large datasets were utilized to test the new under-sampling technique. In the experiments, different classification algorithms including Nave Bayes and Regression among others have been used to derive classifiers and show the impact of the proposed under-sampling technique. The results reported by the classification algorithms when using the consensus clustering method in the pre-processing phase yielded better predictive accuracy on the datasets when compared to not using sampling techniques.\n\n3.1.2. Oversampling\nOversampling is another common sampling approach used to deal with an imbalanced class problem. Various oversampling strategies are available including random oversampling, focused oversampling, and synthetic sampling [11], [13], [27]. The method in which the instances of the minority class are randomly replicated until they have equal representation is known as random oversampling [8]. Random oversampling has two major shortcomings: it increases the possibility of overfitting of the classifier on the training dataset, and if the original data already has high dimensionality, it mounts the computation cost thus increasing the training time of the classifier [10]. In focused oversampling, only those minority class values with samples occurring on the boundary between the majority and minority class values are resampled. However, Chawla et al. [11] state that these methods of oversampling by replication lead to a more specific decision region of the minority class. To overcome this and broaden this decision region, they propose an advanced heuristic oversampling technique called the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). SMOTE is a technique in which oversampling of the minority class is carried out by generating synthetic examples. These new synthetic minority class examples are the result of interpolation between closely located minority class samples. Chawla et al. [11] describe the process of SMOTE as calculating the nearest same-class neighbours for every minority example and then based on the required oversampling rate, randomly choosing from these neighbouring examples. The synthetic examples are then generated at random points along the line segments joining the minority examples with these chosen neighbours. This process expands the decision region pertaining to the minority class. The authors tested SMOTE on a wide variety of datasets with different training sizes and degree of imbalance. It was observed that the larger and less specific decision regions of SMOTE resulted in this method outperforming oversampling by replacement.\n\n3.2. Algorithm-driven approach\nIn this approach, the classification algorithm is adjusted to facilitate the learning task specifically with respect to the minority class. In this approach, no changes are made to the input data distribution. This approach includes cost sensitive learning, thresholding, and hybrid methods like ensemble learners among others.\n\n3.2.1. Cost-sensitive learning\nThe basic assumption by any traditional classification algorithm is that there is a cost of misclassification is the same for all response variable values [10], [14]. However, in real world applications the cost of misclassification may vary among target class values. For example, in the field of medical diagnosis predicting that a person suffers from a particular disease when he does not will lead to more medical examinations. On other hand, misclassifying a person as healthy when he actually suffers from the disease can lead to excessive health costs and potential fatality. In this situation, the cost of misclassification is higher, so the classifier ought to be sensitive to the type of application and more importantly the cost associated with misclassification [8], [35]. To address this issue, cost-sensitive learning was proposed, so if the underlying dataset has a class ratio of 1:3 favouring the majority class, then the misclassifying cost for the minority class will be three times that of the majority class [24]. An important concept in cost-sensitive learning is the Cost Matrix [8] which comprises the average cost of misclassification for each available class. The goal of this method is to minimize misclassification cost by choosing a class with minimum conditional risk [28]. The layout of the cost matrix is depicted in Table 1 below, where \u03bbij is the cost of misclassifying a sample from True Class j to Class i.\n\nTable 1. Cost matrix.\n\nEmpty Cell Empty Cell Prediction\nEmpty Cell Empty Cell Class i Class j\nTrue Class i 0 \u03bbij\nClass j \u03bbji 0\nThe diagonal entries indicate correct classification, hence the cost associated with this is zero. Other common cost-sensitive learning models are MetaCost which is a wrapper method of making the classifier cost sensitive, and AdaCost which is a cost-sensitive version of AdaBoost [18], [35].\n\n3.2.2.

For notational convenience, we define pt:\npt={p1\u2212pif y=1otherwise,(2)\nView SourceRight-click on figure for MathML and additional features.and rewrite CE(p,y)=CE(pt)=\u2212log(pt).\n\nThe CE loss can be seen as the blue (top) curve in Fig. 1. One notable property of this loss, which can be easily seen in its plot, is that even examples that are easily classified (pt\u226b.5) incur a loss with non-trivial magnitude. When summed over a large number of easy examples, these small loss values can overwhelm the rare class.\n\n3.1 Balanced Cross Entropy\nA common method for addressing class imbalance is to introduce a weighting factor \u03b1\u2208[0,1] for class 1 and 1\u2212\u03b1 for class \u22121. In practice \u03b1 may be set by inverse class frequency or treated as a hyperparameter to set by cross validation. For notational convenience, we define \u03b1t analogously to how we defined pt. We write the \u03b1-balanced CE loss as:\nCE(pt)=\u2212\u03b1tlog(pt).(3)\nView SourceRight-click on figure for MathML and additional features.This loss is a simple extension to CE that we consider as an experimental baseline for our proposed focal loss.\n\n3.2 Focal Loss Definition\nAs our experiments will show, the large class imbalance encountered during training of dense detectors overwhelms the cross entropy loss. Easily classified negatives comprise the majority of the loss and dominate the gradient. While \u03b1 balances the importance of positive/negative examples, it does not differentiate between easy/hard examples. Instead, we propose to reshape the loss function to down-weight easy examples and thus focus training on hard negatives.\n\nMore formally, we propose to add a modulating factor (1\u2212pt)\u03b3 to the cross entropy loss, with tunable focusing parameter \u03b3\u22650. We define the focal loss as:\nFL(pt)=\u2212(1\u2212pt)\u03b3log(pt).(4)\nView SourceRight-click on figure for MathML and additional features.The focal loss is visualized for several values of \u03b3\u2208[0,5] in Fig. 1. We note two properties of the focal loss. (1) When an example is misclassified and pt is small, the modulating factor is near 1 and the loss is unaffected. As pt\u21921, the factor goes to 0 and the loss for well-classified examples is down-weighted. (2) The focusing parameter \u03b3 smoothly adjusts the rate at which easy examples are down-weighted. When \u03b3=0, FL is equivalent to CE, and as \u03b3 is increased the effect of the modulating factor is likewise increased (we found \u03b3=2 to work best in our experiments).\n\nIntuitively, the modulating factor reduces the loss contribution from easy examples and extends the range in which an example receives low loss. For instance, with \u03b3=2, an example classified with pt=0.9 would have 100\u00d7 lower loss compared with CE and with pt\u22480.968 it would have 1000\u00d7 lower loss. This in turn increases the importance of correcting misclassified examples (whose loss is scaled down by at most 4\u00d7 for pt\u2264.5 and \u03b3=2).\n\nIn practice we use an \u03b1-balanced variant of the focal loss:\nFL(pt)=\u2212\u03b1t(1\u2212pt)\u03b3log(pt).(5)\nView SourceRight-click on figure for MathML and additional features.We adopt this form in our experiments as it yields slightly improved accuracy over the non-\u03b1-balanced form. Finally, we note that the implementation of the loss layer combines the sigmoid operation for computing p with the loss computation, resulting in greater numerical stability.\n\nWhile in our main experimental results we use the focal loss definition above, its precise form is not crucial. In Section 3.5 we consider other instantiations of the focal loss and demonstrate that these can be equally effective.\n\n3.3 Class Imbalance and Model Initialization\nBinary classification models are by default initialized to have equal probability of outputting either y=\u22121 or 1. Under such an initialization, in the presence of class imbalance, the loss due to the frequent class can dominate total loss and cause instability in early training. To counter this, we introduce the concept of a \u2018prior\u2019 for the value of p estimated by the model for the rare class (foreground) at the start of training. We denote the prior by \u03c0 and set it so that the model's estimated p for examples of the rare class is low, e.g., 0.01. We note that this is a change in model initialization (see Section 4.1) and not of the loss function. We found this to improve training stability for both the cross entropy and focal loss in the case of heavy class imbalance.\"\nFrom the above paper, summarize and explain how focal loss for tackling the imbalanced dataset problem in deep learning and its advantages. Try to use your own words, do not copy the sentences directly from the above paper.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Focal loss is a sophisticated approach developed to handle the significant class imbalance problem often encountered in one-stage object detection tasks. Traditional object detection models may struggle when they need to distinguish between a vast number of background classes (e.g., different types of objects not of immediate interest) and a relatively small number of foreground classes (the objects of interest), sometimes at ratios as extreme as 1:1000.\n\nIn essence, the focal loss is built upon the foundation of cross-entropy (CE) loss, a common loss function used in binary classification tasks, which traditionally treats all misclassifications equally. However, this equal treatment can lead to a scenario where the aggregate loss contributed by easily classified examples (which are predominantly from the majority class) overwhelms the total loss, thereby overshadowing the errors made on the minority class which are usually harder to classify accurately.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, focal loss introduces a critical modification to the CE loss by incorporating a modulating factor \\((1 - p_t)^\\gamma\\), where \\(p_t\\) is the model's estimated probability for the class under consideration, and \\(\\gamma\\) is a focusing parameter that controls the strength of penalty applied to well-classified examples. This modification effectively reduces the loss contribution from easy examples (those with high \\(p_t\\)), allowing the model to focus more on the hard, misclassified examples. As a result, this ensures that the minority class errors receive proportionally more attention during the training process, thereby directly tackling the class imbalance problem.\n\nAdditionally, focal loss can be further refined by integrating an \\(\\alpha\\)-balancing factor, leading to an \\(\\alpha\\)-balanced focal loss formulation. This adjustment allows for even more nuanced control over the model's focus, by differentiating between the importance of positive and negative examples through the \\(\\alpha\\) parameter, which can be set based on inverse class frequency or optimized as a hyperparameter.\n\nAn important benefit of focal loss is its inherent flexibility, evidenced by its performance improvements in dense object detectors despite class imbalance. The introduction of the focusing parameter \\(\\gamma\\) allows researchers and practitioners to fine-tune how aggressively the model should focus on the hard examples, with a higher value of \\(\\gamma\\) increasing this focus. Experiments have indicated that a \\(\\gamma\\) value of 2 tends to offer optimal performance, significantly reducing the loss for well-classified examples and hence allowing the model to concentrate its learning capacity on difficult, often misclassified instances.\n\nMoreover, to facilitate stable training from the outset, especially under severe class imbalance conditions, the concept of model initialization with a \u2018prior\u2019 for the minority class is introduced. This helps in configuring the model's initial guesses towards lower probabilities for the rare class, thus addressing potential instability issues during the early phases of training.\n\nIn summary, focal loss presents a robust and effective solution to the prevalent challenge of class imbalance in deep learning tasks, particularly in object detection scenarios. By dynamically adjusting the contribution of each example to the total loss based on its difficulty, focal loss ensures that models can learn more effectively from rare classes, leading to improved overall performance and accuracy."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Shorter"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Focal loss is a technique designed to address the class imbalance problem in deep learning, particularly in object detection tasks where the imbalance between background (majority) and foreground (minority) classes can be extreme.
