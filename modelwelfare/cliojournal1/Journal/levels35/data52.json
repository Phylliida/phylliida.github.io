OK, so let's look at 2 maps of India. The top map, map of India is\npolitical map. So we have, we have talked about how Kashmir is placed in\nthe political map of India and I won't go into that again here. But. Political\nmap means this is the map that where the states are divided and and you\nsee what state or part of India the maps on the bottom. The map on the\nbottom is a linguistic map of India. So I think I have said this multiple times\nbefore. India has a very multilingual country and multilingualism works\nvery interestingly and for a linguist and a language learner nerd like me\nvery, very beautifully. So you see that all of the colors on this map are\nrepresentative of different languages that are spoken in India. And when\nwe're talking about these languages and these colors, we are talking\nmultiple million people's. Making these languages. So when we talk about\nHindi for example, there are 400 million speakers of Hindi and that means\nthat there are other people who speak Hindi. Maybe as a non-native\nlanguage it means that they speak. Speak a different variety of Hindi, a\ndialect of Hindi. There could be somebody who is a native speaker of\nPunjabi but speaks Hindi as a as a lingua franca, that is a language of\nbusiness or something like that, right? So in a usual day, it is not hard to\nimagine that somebody is in in India is using anywhere from 2 to 3\nlanguages just because just because they are, because that is their lived\ncontext, that is their lived reality. OK, so for example, I grew up in a Hindi\nspeaking household, but my parents also spoke some Gujarati. So I\nunderstand a little bit of Gujarati. Gujarati is a language spoken in West\nIndia right around here. And or actually right around there. I'm sorry this\nthis pointing with my hand is not working, but you kind of know what I\nmean. And you can also Google where is Gujarati spoken in India. Ohh, so I\nspoke a little bit of Gujarati, especially with my grandparents. You know\nhow lots of people are always trying to make their children impress their\ngrandparents? Gujarati was my language to impress my grandparents.\nBoth sides of both. Both sets of grandparents. So spoke a little bit of\nGujarati, and then I went to an English medium school, which meant that\nall of my schooling was in English, which meant that I learned sciences in\nEnglish math and English social study, blah blah blah. You know the whole\nthing. And of course I learned English, English literature, things of that\nnature. So people are generally multilingual and at least bilingual are\nseveral are multilingual and that does not mean people are not\nmonolingual. Many people are monolingual as well. But monolingual in\nsome language or some dialect, so India has. 26 languages in the schedule\nof the Constitution of India, meaning that one can. Study those languages\nin the schools one can study, one can do some sort of business like buy\nland. If you go to buy land, let's say even in Ohio, you have to buy it in a\nlanguage, right? A form will be presented to you in a language. That\nlanguage will be English in Ohio, but in let's say the state of Gujarat or in in\nthe state of Uttar Pradesh, that that form can be in Hindi or in English. It is\npossible in Uttar Pradesh. It can also be in Urdu. I'm not 100% sure about\nthat. So you can you can do business multilinguality. Oh, and that's really\nlovely, right? You you you learn multiple languages in schools, which you\ndo here as well, but you also might grow up speaking multiple languages\nin your home like I did. So in general, we're talking about a really\nmultilingual country. The next thing I wanted to show you was like one of\nthose. You know how in in like kindergarten classrooms, there are lots of\nposters on the walls and this is the type of poster we had in the walls of\nour classrooms, which is our kindergarten classrooms, which is like people\nof India and dress of India, right. So like there are like male and female\ncostumes or I should say dresses from different parts of India, from\ndifferent regions of India and these kind of align. With with States and\nthese are just this is just a random like poster of different women's dresses\nfrom all over India. So when we are talking about a multilingual country,\nwe are also talking about a multicultural country. We're also talking about\npeople, as you saw in these posters, wearing different types of dresses.\nAnd all of that is. Is unmarked, meaning if you are, let's say, driving from\nNew Delhi which is the capital of I2, let's say a West Indian state of\nRajasthan. You will definitely start hearing a different language after about\n200 miles or 200 kilometers, and you will probably start seeing some\ndifferences in how at least women were dressing in in the same amount of\nmiles. So there's like there there is very visible, audible type of visual,\naudible type of type of diversity. In language as well as in culture. So when\nwe are talking about this type of diversity and this type of linguistic,\ncultural, let's say culinary. A diversity, variety, etc. How does that? What\ndoes that mean for Bollywood? Uh, let's look at it in terms of what does\nthat mean in general, and then what does it mean for Bollywood? What it\nmeans in general is there is sometimes a lot of politics around language,\nright? So there are people who would say we should have a national\nlanguage and that national language should be Hindi. And then speakers\nof, like, you know, every other language would be like, Oh no, that's not\ngoing to work. How, why? Why would that work for us? And. There's\ndispute about that. There's conflict around that. There are sometimes really\nviolent conflict around that. In fact when you will or if you already have,\nyou already know this. But when you read the article, this article today\nfrom this for this class vellum Dissanaike language in Hindi cinema article,\nyou will read that in not in India per SE, but also in India, but in Sri Lanka,\nthere there was a civil war that was more or less about language that was.\nAbout Sinhalese and Tamil and and language is really related to our\nidentity and our culture and our sense of self. So, so people are people,\npeople are very. Very, very serious about it, let's say. So what does it mean\nfor Bollywood? It means that Bollywood is of course Hindi language\ncinema. So when we are thinking about Bollywood, we are thinking about\nhow how Bollywood, which is Hindi language cinema but which might be\ncirculated in other parts of the country, how that that imaging, how that,\nhow the representation of different people on the screen in Bollywood\nworks. So that's kind of what we're talking about this week. And I'm, I'm.\nI'm going to be looking at a lot of my notes now, but. But when we are\ntalking about. And we are talking about seeing an image on the on the\nscreen and we are talking about seeing a person. Is it possible that even\nbefore we see, before we hear the person, we make an assumption about\nhow they will talk? So is it possible that even before I speak, somebody\nwho looks at me can be like, oh, that woman, she will have an Indian\naccent? Uh, and that may or may not be true. There is no copyright of\nIndian women on the way I dress, right? So like somebody else could be\ndressed like this and they probably don't have an Indian accent. So. But,\nbut, but the point here is, when we see somebody on the screen and on a\nBollywood film screen, do we ever make an assumption that, oh, this is\nhow they're going to talk and this is what perhaps even they're going to\nsay? It is that area. It is that assumption that we are kind of underlining\ntoday and we are talking about today O with our film for today, we kind of\nreally challenge the assumption that the film is trying to make. And with\nthis specific reading when we are thinking about we can think more\ngenerally about how we treat people who speak language differently and\nhow does. How does cinema represent different languages? So even from\nour our lecture and our reading from last week, we kind of saw that there\nis some politics of Hinduism and Islam in India. I should say there's a lot of\npolitics of Hinduism in Islam in India and there's a language association\nwith this politics. Islam is generally associated with Urdu in North India and\nHinduism is associated with Hindu in North India and both of these.\nLanguages can sometimes be at ARM and not not getting along but\nBollywood, and we have seen this in other examples kind of is a blend of of\nwhat is, what is Urdu and what is Hindi. It is kind of like Hindi, Urdu or\nHindustani. That's the colloquial form of what we speak. What one speaks\nwhen one speaks Hindi in North India or one speaks Urdu in North India as\nwell, more, more or less so. What does it mean when we kind of have\nthese types of associations with with language and with people? And more\nmore generally, what does it mean when this type of conflict that is not\nnecessarily linguistic, when there is the Hindu, Hindi, Urdu conflict, which\nis kind of not about language, it's more about religion that that conflict is\nrepresented on film. So. So the point that that our author makes is this.\nThere is a relationship between what we are seeing on the screen and\nwhat language is being spoken on the screen and what we are assuming\nabout what the characters will say. That relationship is underlined by how\nwe generally understand the relationship between different languages and\ndifferent different people, even if those different languages and different\npeople were part of the same nation, were part of India. So in Bollywood\nfilm, there's a particular way in which different types of Indians, in which\nIndians from different communities in which Indians from different states\nof India. Which are which are also linguistic in a lot of senses are\nrepresented in Bollywood film. So how is the Bengali person represented?\nBengal is a state in East India. How is Gujarati person represented? Gujarat\nis a state in east in in West India. How is a Punjabi person represented?\nHow is a Tamil Nadu person or a Tamil person represented? Tamil Nadu is\na state in southern India and and. Does Nikki makes the point that in a lot\nof ways when we are talking about language with respect to Hollywood\nfilm, we are basically saying that language is secondary to the visual that\nyou see on the screen. That may actually not be true for Bollywood cinema\nand for his point for Sri Lankan cinema, because what you see on the\nscreen is a combination of the language that is being spoken of the\nlanguage. Variety that is being spoken and the image that you see. So, so\nthe point here is I well, the point has already been made. But an additional\npoint here is that there is a deeper relationship between what is being said\nand the visual image in cinema out of Bollywood. Then there is other forms\nof cinema because this is a region of the world that is just very, very\nmultilingual and also in a lot of ways very, very multicultural. And I think as\nwe as we go on this this week, we can we can see more more detail about\nthis point. The last thing to think about in terms of the snake is, is the\nrelationship between language and the nation state. And again, that's the\npoint that I'm going to keep on making this this week, because yes,\nBollywood cinema is in Hindi, but Bollywood really does represent a lot of\ndifferent type of people on the screen, and we definitely see that in the film\nfor this week in Chennai Express. So there's definitely a relationship\nbetween what one speaks and how they are and how much. Or how little\nare they part of the nation or the nation building project? Think about this\nwith respect to the United States and with respect to how languages that\nare not English are represented in the United States. How do we talk about\nSpanish? How do we talk about French? How do we talk about German?\nHow do we talk about Hindi for that matter? So think about how the status\nof these languages is represented in United States and. That kind of will\nlead you to what the snake is trying to say. There is a relationship between\nhow language works, what language one speaks and how they are or they\nare not, or in what capacity are they not or are part of the nation state,\nright. So. So in that way, language is really, really tied to citizenship and\nhow. And how how the nation treats their citizens.\"\n\nUsing only the lecture content, answer the following questions in a 200 word response\n1. What does the linguistic and cultural diversity in India mean for Bollywood?\n2. How does addition of characters from non-Hindi speaking backgrounds add to the story of Bollywood films?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The linguistic and cultural diversity in India significantly impacts Bollywood by enriching the storytelling and representation on screen. In a country as multilingual and multicultural as India, Bollywood, predominantly a Hindi language cinema, navigates a complex cultural landscape. The inclusion of characters from diverse linguistic backgrounds beyond Hindi speaking regions adds depth and authenticity to the narratives, reflecting the lived realities of its multi-ethnic audience. This diversity allows Bollywood films to portray a wider array of stories that resonate with various linguistic and cultural communities within India.\n\nCharacters from non-Hindi speaking backgrounds are not just mere additions; they bring their unique cultural and linguistic nuances, challenging and enriching the narrative fabric of Bollywood movies. This inclusion goes beyond representation, becoming a narrative device that offers perspectives and voices that might otherwise be marginalized. Films like \"Chennai Express,\" highlighted in the lecture, underscore how Bollywood navigates and represents India's linguistic and cultural diversity by featuring characters from different states and linguistic backgrounds, thereby addressing and engaging with the multilingual nature of the country. Through these portrayals, Bollywood films can challenge stereotypes, foster inclusion, and build a more nuanced understanding of the nation's fabric, showcasing the interplay between language, identity, and belonging within the broader context of the Indian nation-state."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user asked about the representation of characters from different regions and the role of skin tone in Bollywood.

I want to say the\ntitle of that book was Bollywood and globalization, but please do not quote\nme on that. Look at the syllabus. I'm really bad with titles. But this article I\nremember, I remember the title. It's fair and lovely. It was written in 2018.\nAnd there's a story about why this is called fair and lovely. And of course\nI'll tell you because you know I will, but this article is really, really dear to\nme. I really enjoy reading it and it really makes an impact in terms of what\nwe are trying to say here, what we are trying to do here and. And let's\nreally get into it. So I'm going to start this this article is about background\ndancers, so. You have seen a lot of films at this point, which also means\nthat you have seen a lot of songs and you have actually seen more songs\nthan films, probably because we have I use a lot of songs in examples in\nour lectures. So the idea of a background dancer is, you know, the hero or\nthe protagonist, the the heroine, the other protagonists, they're dancing a\nlot. We actually dedicated a week to this in the early part of the term. And\nas they're dancing, there's a lot of people dancing around them, right? So\nin big, in big songs, there could be hundreds of dancers, but in in shorter\nframe songs, we have anywhere from like, you know, four or five dancers,\nsometimes even two. To like 30-40 people dancing behind behind the\nmain person who is doing the dance behind the protagonist and most of\nthe time replicating the moves of the protagonist, sometimes doing their\nown thing such that the protagonist shines even more in his or her her\ndance moves. So the article tells us that there has been a change in the\nBollywood film industry in terms of who these background dancers are,\nand that that speaks to other things, and we'll get to those other things.\nBut in terms of of Gandhi's methods, I, I, I, I, I want to underline this one\nmore time. Gunti actually goes to the film sets in Bollywood sometimes as\nan assistant director and actually studies what is happening on the set,\nright? So she is on the set, talking to people, gathering information and\nmaking observations. So she's really there. She's an anthropologist and\nthat's how anthropologists, cultural anthropologists. To do their work. So\nwe have an encounter has been writing about Bollywood for about two\ndecades now, so she has a lot of a lot of information to share with us. So\nlet's get into it. I want you to watch this, this song from a film you have\nseen, Kabhi Kushi, Kabhi gum. We're just watching a very short moment\nfrom the song like less than a minute and and then we'll we'll go on. So\nwe're inserting a song, OK. Um and. What I want to do now is I want you\nto watch another song and this is from a different film which you have also\nseen hamaki haikan and this song is a. Is is like, again, very popular, lots of\nbackground dancers. Go ahead and watch it and we'll come back and talk\nabout these\nFilm Clip (\u201cShava Shava...\u201d and \u201cJoote Do, Paise Lo\u201d)\n[Clip 1, Shava Shava]\nOne, two... One, two, three, four! Say hey, hey... Your beauty is lovely...\n[Clip 2, Joote Do, Paise Lo]\nHey, hey! Sister-in-laws of the groom, the ones with the green scarf Give\nthe shoes back and take the money\nLecture Video Continued\n[Dr. Ila Nagar] So the song from K3G which is. Which is more recent than\nHamachi Chekon has white women dancing behind Amitabh Bachchan,\ntall, thin white women. The song from Hamaki Henkan has a very different\ntype of background dancing dancer. Background dancer set right a set of\npeople. The observation that Gunti makes is. As India became more\nglobalized and as Bollywood film became more internationalized, who\nwere the background dancers and were their identities were changed?\nAnd I think these two songs looked at next to each other really show that\nchange. Again, the women dancing around Amitabh Bachchan in Kabhi\nKhushi Kabhi Gam are very different from the men and women dancing\naround Salman Khan and Madhuri Dixit in in Hamade Haikan. So that is\njust an observation thing. Uh. Gumti says that this is related to\nglobalization, to how Bollywood film after 1991, when economic\nliberalization in India happened. So before 1991, it was very, very difficult,\nnearly impossible for foreign capital to flow into India. 1991 heads India is\nkind of economically in a in a very complex place that basically India does\nnot have money. And in 1991 India says let's open our markets, let's let\nforeign capital flow. And that was a big and defining moment in in the\neconomic history of the country. And that led to a lot of different changes.\nI'm sure you can take a class on what 1991 economic liberalization did to\nIndia, but for our purposes, film became really globalized in that foreign\ncapital could flow into Bollywood film. If you will recall, Ganti actually\nmakes this observation with Karan Johar in the first article that we read in\nthe reading for week one, where foreign like MGM and Paramount and\nSony are trying to invest money in India and in Indian film. And Karan Johar\nsays, oh, but we work like a fraternity. We have a different system. So\nyou're welcome. But you know, we're different. So making the point being.\nThere is more money flowing in. Different types of things are happening.\nOne of the examples of globalization of Bollywood film that that Ganti\ngives is Snoop Dog in in in a 2008 eight film video. So of course I have to\nmake you suffer this. Look at it for a minute. I think yeah, maybe maybe a\nminute and 1/2 and then we'll get back.\nFilm Clip (\u201cSingh is King\u201d)\nRDB, DPGC, Akshay and Snoop D-O-double-G Oh yeah, Singh is King.\nThis is the thing. Do you know what I mean? Follow me. Listen to me for a\nsecond, check it. Singh is the king. Check the records. Friendship is their\nlife, their glory is different. Laughing is their identity. That's why the world\nsays. Friendship is their life, their glory is different. Laughing is their\nidentity. Everyone says this together. Singh is king... now everyone know\nthat! Singh is king... they are the kings of the world! Singh is king... now\neveryone know that! Singh is king... they are the kings of the world!\nFerraris, Buggatis and Maseratis, Snoop D-O-double-G the life of the\nparty. Lay back, stay back, I'm in the Maybach, This ain't James Brown, but\nit's the big payback. Watch me zoom by, make it boom by, What up to all\nthe ladies hanging out in Mumbai. Cheese make dollars, east west masala,\nSingh is the king, so you all have to follow Wat up, wat up, wat up, I'm\ntrying to stack my bottle, wat up, wat up... Singh is king... now everyone\nknow that! Singh is king... they are the kings of the world!\nLecture Video Continued\n[Dr. Ila Nagar] We see in this video that Snoop Dogg is basically dancing\nnext to next to Akshay Kumar and he's doing his thing. He's Snoop Dogg\nafter all. So as he's doing his thing, you know Akshay Kumar is dancing\nalong and you know the frame is changing from a village setting to a\nSnoop Dogg setting. And, and and that is that. But Snoop Dogg's presence\nin a Bollywood film with Akshay Kumar, who was also the hero of\nSuryavanshi, if you will recall, is a is a thing, right? It speaks to how\nHollywood is. Is there also there is an exchange Hindi films are showing in\nin in Western cities like that. We have read all of that. We know all of that.\nSo in this, in this moment we have we have said a few things so far in this\nlecture. We have said that there's something going on with the\nbackground dancers. We have said they just, they just when you guys\nbasically telling us something going on about Bollywood dancer dancers,\nbackground dancers, the economy is liberalizing and there's a globalization\nof polywood. An example of that globalization of Bollywood is Snoop\nDogg in in Akshay Kumar film, lots of other examples. Now that's just one I\npulled because it's especially fun one. I want you to see some images now,\nand these are a little bit weird, but weird, maybe even triggering, maybe a\nlittle bit disturbing. So be mindful of that and. And we'll we'll come back\nand connect these two to our reading. So this is, this is an image of what is\ncalled a fairness cream and these have existed in India for as long as I\nremember, especially this brand, this brand is called fair and lovely and this\nis the brand that kind of. That that's kind of the parent brand of this\ntradition of Fair and lovely things. Although I must say that there are like\nhome remedies to look fairer, fairer, skinned type thing. Oh, so this is this\nperson is a model. She's just doing a fair and lovely I I want to say this is a\nlocal Indian brand, but it hadn't been, it might have been sold out to to\nUnilever or something. I am not 100% sure anymore. This image, however,\nis Deepika Padukone, who is also our heroine for today's film, and she is\nadvertising what they're calling a fair miracle. And this is by Garnier, which\nis obviously an international brand. You. By Garnier and Giant Eagle here.\nAnd then it's not just women who are advertising this. Shahrukh Khan is\nadvertising it and it says fair and handsome for men who want zyada,\nziada means more. And this is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> advertising a fairness cream\nbrand for men. So, uh, fairness of skin is. Umm. Again I'm sorry this, this\ncould this could be triggering in in a variety of ways for for a variety of\npeople. So be mindful of that. But but but fair skinned people are given\nmore more value in a variety of ways in Indian society. So within the\ncontext of the arranged marriage system, women who are fair skinned or\nare far more appealing to people than men who are forest. Than than\nwomen who are not fair skinned and men who are fair skinned are far\nmore appealing than men who are not fair skinned, et cetera. So it's it's a\nit's a very specific kind of systemic discrimination that works within India\nwhere you know, where skin tone of a human being is related to their their\nvalue, their worth. So that in and of itself is, is, is, is a piece for us to know.\nThat kind of explains. Um, that kind of explains the title of this piece. It also\nexplains why in some ways the women dancing around Amitabh\nBachchan or white women, and the women and men dancing around\nSharon, Salman Khan and Madhuri Dikshit than Hamat Ki Haikan song that\nwe watched earlier in this video are are people from India normal looking?\nNormal people from India? Ah, so this fascination with fair skin, while it is\nnot new, it has existed. Advertising amplifies things and advertising is\ncapable of really amplifying things. So I actually, I mean I grew up in India, I\nabsolutely remember these. Fair and lovely advertisements on TV and\nmagazines where you would like we you know we saw the the skin tone\nand and it's just it's just terrible and it's terrifying in a lot of ways for for\npeople for self esteem for a variety of reasons for mental health. But but\nit's it's it's a reality of Indian society. So so. When we are talking about\nwhat happened to Bob to background dancers, they used to be from a\nunion. The people in the Union would get 400 some rupees to do 8 hour\nshift in a Bollywood dance video and then they would go home. They\nwould have their own thing, they would leave. Come 1991, economic\nliberalization films are being made in very different ways. People are\npeople are interacting in cinema very differently. We have actually\naddressed this in our lectures before, where we have seen that post 1995,\nwhat family does in film changed, what film does itself change. Sets are\nbigger, stars are bigger or production values are different. So, so are\ndancers. And those people who just made a living out of dancing in\nBollywood film A became were sidelined for students, for young people\nwho were from upper middle class families who could come and dance in a\nBollywood video for far more money, five times more money, and just do it\nfor fun so they would come like Gunti gives us the example of people\ncoming. In their own cars chauffeur different cars, which is not as. Upper\nclass as it sounds here it's it's, but anyway. People would come with their\nown, you know, everything, and they would just be getting doing doing\nthis for pocket money as opposed to people who are feeding their families\nwith this, with this type of income. And as Gunter's talking to those\ndancers that used to be on the film said that could do this work to feed\ntheir families and support themselves. They are noticing that the way they\nlook is what has changed their fortunes and how much money they have\nhas changed their fortunes. So this is this is an example ganti gives of. Of a\nfilm. This film is called Delto Pagal Hai. You know, I have told you guys\nhow I was like a fan of going to the first show of the film. And this one I\nwas like crazy about because it had Shahrukh Khan and I really had to go\nto it and whatever. It's a terrible film, but it's it's, it's a Bollywood film. It's a\nterrible Bollywood film, but it's also very fun, you know? Anyway, so this\nfilm kind of started the change of the dancer in the Bollywood. And while\nthis is kind of a grainy image, the point is this person, this person, this guy\nright here, he is the son of two Bollywood actors, not like big name\nBollywood actors, but big enough name Bollywood actors and he's himself\na major hero at this point in time. His name is Shahid Kapoor, but he's a\nbackground dancer here. Not because he has to be, not because he's\nsupporting his family. He's probably getting some experience here, or he is\njust doing it. For fun. So this film, the choreographer of this film was\nshamak Dawar and the film was Dil to Pagal Hai, meaning the heart is\ncrazy. And this is the film that kind of as far as ganti is concerned, changed\nthe way background dancers were interacting with Bollywood film. They\nbecame far more far more white, far more, far more swap, far more, far\nmore. Other class of than what was happening in film previously and those\npeople obviously lost their jobs. So Ganti calls this the gentrification of\nBollywood film. The way that gentrification works is there's an existing\nsystem and we try to remove that system. We try to beautify it, we try to\nreplace it with something different, usually something more expensive,\nusually something that people around that area cannot afford. So that is\nexactly what comes or what becomes of the background Bollywood dance.\nAnd uh, and whiteness? Fairness of skin is really tight to that. Uh, it also,\nthis is a very interesting point ganti makes. So I'm going to make it even\nthough we're not connecting it right now, these two phones. So you've\nseen Hamade haikan 1994. It was made by Sooraj Barjatya. The producer\nwas Suraj Barjatya. And this film Nadiya Ke Paar was also made by Sooraj\nBarjatya. Same family, maybe if not him and uncle or father or something\nlike that, they were also so Hamad Kaikan. Was almost an exact frame by\nframe, replica or copy if you could say of this film Nadiya Ke par meaning\nacross the river. So the 1982 film Nadiya Ke Paar was a really popular film.\nIt made a lot of money. Hammock, hang on, you know, was an extremely\npopular film, also made a lot of money. I actually watched Nadiya Ke Par\nthe 1982 film like not too long ago, and I was really, really impressed by it\nif we did not have time. Strains I would have assigned the film. The\ninteresting part about the two phones really like it really makes gunti's\npoint is the first phone shot in a village, local people, local language, more\nprogressive, really more progressive than the second film, which had like\nfar more money, far bigger production values, giant stars. They basically\ngot everyone big that they could get, and it made it far more conservative,\nfar more patriarchical. Far more. Far more terrible, if I could say that. So this\nwas, this was a like a very sweet kind of setting, very innocent and really\nprogressive. And this one was like so much money and nothing good\nhappening. So like really gentrification of Bollywood, these, these two\njuxtaposed next to each other, could really speak to the gentrification of\nBollywood, which is which is the point ganti tries to make for us. The last\nthing I wanted to um wanted to show to you guys is I don't know if this\nimage is clear, but this is called a golden Pex and it's again, this is this is\ntriggering, it's an offensive thing that I'm showing you. Offensive thing, not\nin terms of I'm offending you, but in terms of what this what this is. This is\na phenomena that is not particularly old in in North India, but this is really\ntied to internationalization, globalization as well as fair skin fascination. So\nthese are this is an advertisement for a company where you can hire\nhostesses for a wedding party. Are from Russia. So there are basically\nwhite women who would stand at at the gate of a very big party or very\nexpensive party and just agree to people. The point of having these\nwomen there is that they are white women and that they're greeting\npeople and that they are, first of all that the family can afford that, but\nsecondly that these these women are being hired just for being white. So,\nso going back to going back to Cynthia's point, there is a there is a larger\nsense of or one could say what she is saying, what Gunti is saying in a\nbigger, more generalized way. The fascination with white skin, with fair\nskinned people has grown from. You know a home remedy where, ohh,\nyou've applied this thing to your face and you get fairer skin, clearer skin to\nthis marketing campaign of Shahrukh Khan advertising fair skin and\nDeepika Padukone advertising creams for fairer skin. And those types of\nthings interact with Bollywood in the sense that they are. That they are\nspeaking to how some people are being displaced and other people are\ncoming in their place. The displacement is happening by people. Usually\nthe way displacement happens is wealthier people will displace poorer\npeople. And that's exactly what is happening in this instance as well.\nWealthier of students, college people, women who have men who have\npower to kind of travel internationally or are going into Bollywood and\nreplacing the people who have been doing this for for decades. In the next\nlecture, we will try to we'll try to connect this more closely with with\nlanguage and Chennai Express and and of course this reading.\"\n\nUsing only the lecture content, answer the following questions in a 200 word response\n1. What would ideal representation of characters from other regions\\\\\\/linguistic (and cultural) backgrounds look like?\n\n2. How role does fairness of skin tone play in the life and livelihood of Bollywood background dancers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "From the lecture content, it's evident that an ideal representation of characters from other regions/linguistic and cultural backgrounds in Bollywood, or any cinematic context, would pivot around authenticity and respect for the diversity inherent within India. This would entail telling stories that resonuously portray the rich tapestry of cultures, languages, and traditions across different Indian states and communities, moving beyond superficial or stereotypical depictions. Such representation would ideally involve incorporating regional actors, music, languages, and cultural norms into narratives in a way that reflects the true nature and diversity of Indian society. The lecture mentions, as an example, the films \"Nadiya Ke Paar\" (1982) and its remake \"Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!\" (1994), highlighting how the original offered a more progressive and local touch as compared to its glossy, commercialized successor. This suggests that an ideal representation would also embrace the simplicity and groundedness of local stories, challenging mainstream cinema\u2019s penchant for extravagance and often, over-simplification or distortion of cultural realities.\n\nThe role of fairness of skin tone in the life and livelihood of Bollywood background dancers is highlighted as markedly significant in the lecture. It discusses how economic liberalization and globalization have influenced Bollywood\u2019s aesthetic preferences, leading to a shift in who gets to be a background dancer. The preference has increasingly leaned towards fair-skinned individuals, correlating directly with societal biases that associate lighter skin with higher value. This cultural obsession with fairness is not only reflected in casting practices but also perpetuated by aggressive advertising campaigns for fairness creams, endorsed by leading Bollywood stars. As Bollywood internationalizes, the preference for fairer, often foreign, background dancers displaces local dancers who once made a living out of such roles. This shift underscores a deeper societal issue where skin tone impacts one\u2019s employment opportunities and social standing, illustrating a problematic intertwining of industry practices with broader social prejudices related to fairness."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user asked about the representation of South Indian people in the film Chennai Express, focusing on the problematic stereotypes and cultural insensitivities depicted.

It was really terribly received by the critics and the\npeople loved it. It was a huge hit and it also like, doesn't hurt that it had\ntwo of the biggest stars of of. Well, I guess now too like our our time\nDeepika Padukone and Shahrukh Khan. So it's, it's, it's a pretty it's a pretty\npopular film but it was really criticized for for a variety of things and some\nof them will talk about here again I really want to warn you this is\ntriggering especially because we talk about skin color a lot and we talk\nabout. Talk about the association of skin color with people from southern\nIndia. So. People from southern India have been represented in.\nQuestionable ways in a lot of Bollywood film and in the first lecture for\ntoday, we learned that there is something to be said for how somebody is\ntalking and what that talking on the image on the screen means how\nthey're talking and what that means. Not means in terms of a literal way,\nbut what it what it's trying to convey to us. So when you are in, in a lot of\nfilms from South Asia from, from, from Bollywood, you would see\nsomebody who is portrayed as South Indian because they're wearing a\nparticular type of dress, because they're wearing their their bindi in a\ndifferent way, in a more more localized to South Asia way and you can say\nthat they are southern. They're from southern India also. I should say that\nsouthern India is like saying the Midwest, right? There are like 9 states\nthere. So it's not someone big BLOB of people. There's like so many\ndifferent languages spoken again, lots of diversity. Kerala is different from\nTamil Nadu, which is different from Karnataka, which is different from\nAndhra Pradesh. So it's not like some, some BLOB of that is South India,\nright? There's a lot of diversity. In South India, that's another thing that\nBollywood completely misses. Bollywood completely treats South India as\nif it was one BLOB, and that in and of itself is offensive and problematic.\nBut when we but, but when Bollywood film is usually representing\nsomeone from South India, they're doing it in a negative light. And this\nnegative light can be they become the point of jokes. They're like, oh, we\nwill laugh at your expense. We will laugh because you're using language in\na certain way or because you are doing something in a certain way, right?\nSo you will just insult you and that will somehow be humorous for us. So\nthat is 1 aspect of of of representation of people from South India that\nBollywood. Bollywood kind of propagates or propagated till very recently.\nOther aspects are uh people from other states in India, how are they\nrepresented in Bollywood? How is somebody from Gujarat represented?\nHow is somebody from Bengal represented? How is somebody from\nKashmir represented? Like what is happening with those other states,\nright. So the one example that of the representation of. Of a South Indian\nperson is is the song that you can watch here. And I want you to watch like\nabout two minutes of the song. And it's a really weird, odd song from a\nfilm called Padosan that came out in the late 1960s, I want to say. And it\nwas again a very popular film. The music from this film is still like is still\nalive, still active in a lot of ways. But but the main character, the character\nwho was the. The source of most of the humor and most of the bad humor\nin the film was Assad's, but was a southern Indian person. Other\ncharacters in the film were also from other regions of India, but they were\nnot made fun of like the person that who was from South India. So go\nahead and watch this song.\nFilm Clip 1\nA clever woman is all decked up She enters into the door of my heart And I\nkeep dying, oh my. A clever woman is all decked up A clever woman is all\ndecked up A clever woman is oversmart She keeps digging her own grave\nI kep on laughing, oh my. A clever woman is oversmart -Why do you... -\nThat\u2019s bad Why do you pay attention to them? The world will try to trick\nyou I\u2019ll handle them. From now on if they call you, I\u2019ll handle them.\nLecture Video Continued\n[Dr. Ila Nagar] We see the person that is South Indian, he, he, he has a\nshaved head. He has a very different type of marking on his forehead and\nhe is, he's kind of represented in a questionable in a weird sort of way, the\nnext song I want you to watch again about a minute or so of it. Is a\nrepresentation of a person from Punjab from the western state of Punjab\nand usually Punjabis are represented in Bollywood film as these very loud\nbig hearted. Food loving, fun loving. Like amazing type of people. Lots of\nPunjabi words in Bollywood films are used. So there's a very different type\nof representation. I'm not saying that these two films, these two songs are\ncomparable. What I'm saying is like there's a broad difference in how the\nrepresentation is working. So also these are like really far apart the first\nsong that you that you have already. Dean is is from the 1960s. This one is,\nI want to say, like anywhere from like 10 to 15 years old. It's from a film\ncalled Jab. We met when we met. It's also a very popular film. Go ahead\nand watch.\nFilm Clip 2\nI am starting. You all please join in, too! No problem! We all will join in, too.\nWe are Punjabis! We need an opportunity to start celebrating! Okay,\nsilence! Silence! Settle down, sit comfortably! A capricious, bubbly girl. Her\nmesmerizing eyes are like daggers. And her beauty is lethal When her\nbeauty created rampage, the discussion started. Beat the drum...\nLecture Video Continued\n[Dr. Ila Nagar] When we see this song, we kind of see how happy\neveryone is, how everyone is dancing, how there's a lot of color and and\nthis this person who is singing, he's supposed to be a Punjabi person and\nlots of like life around them. We really cannot say that for a lot of films that\nrepresent a South Indian people. Uh, in some ways. Chennai Express kind\nof reproduced that very stereotypical image of the South Indian person and\nin in a very kind of problematic sort of way. So this is just a generic poster\nof the film. You might have seen it around. If you have not, you're seeing it\nnow. And this is another poster of the film. And look at all the people start\nstanding behind the two protagonists standing behind Shahrukh Khan and\nand Deepika Padukone and. Think for yourself what what this\nrepresentation says about the film. So we know that this film is about a girl\nfrom South India who is running away from from. I guess her, her cousins\nactually and that's that's the first scene. And then the boy from North India\nreally gets tangled in her life and her father happens to be a dawn like a\nmafia guy and. Excuse me. That's how their story starts and eventually the\nBollywood film. They fall in love. There's conflict, it's resolved. Everyone's\nhappy. So in the process of this conflict and resolution of the conflict, there\nare lots of scenes that are that in no way, actually. Say something or in\nsome instances actually they do. They they like make a contrast between\nNorth India and South India. There's actually a song that makes the\ncontrast between North India and South India and says, oh we are, we are,\nthe two of us are the perfect combination. We've kind of come together as\nNorth and South India. But the thing I wanted to kind of show you and and\nand and and this this I recognize is highly problematic. But you have seen\nthe film or you will here soon look look at this image like this is Shahrukh\nKhan. In in a comic scene around around people from from South India and\nlook at Shahrukh Khan and look at the people who are behind him. The\nsame applies here one all of the cousins that are part of the brigade to save\nDeepika Padukone or are. Very different looking than Shahrukh Khan.\nNone of them is kind of a a hero figure. They're all very villainous and\nthey're all very villainous in almost comical sort of way. The only person\nthat is kind of not represented in a negative physical way is the main villain\nin the film. So we have tangali here, but. Everyone around him is presented\nin this very, very comically villainous, villainous way. So the the point here\nis that is that this specific film is literally using skin color as a demarcation\nbetween South India and North India. And not just skin color. It is basically\na juxtaposing villainess with. The particular skin color. So in that sense,\nthis, this was a really problematic film. And all of the critics, if you go read\nany review of the film, most of the reviews of this film were very, very\nnegative. The interesting thing happens to be that Deepika Padukone is is\na South Indian woman. She is not from North India. And she was like, no, I\nwould never do that. How can I caricature my own culture? And you know,\nthat's exactly what the film does. But again, the film was the. Really well\non the box office. And that in some ways speaks to like this normalization\nof of particular ways of seeing the world. Which brings me to the last point\nhere with reference to Chennai Express. What does it mean when we have\nrepresentation like this within Bollywood, right? So we know that we are\ntalking about a very diverse linguistic landscape when we were talking\nabout. In India, we know that Bollywood is Hindi language cinema. But\nBollywood represents a lot of other types of Indians and a lot of other\ntypes of. That's in fact what Bollywood tries to do. In earlier parts of the\nterm, we learned that the Bollywood hero is supposed to be this very\ngeneric. Very. Nobody as far as like casts associations go, usually very\nmiddle class, usually very much in the service of the nation person. And all\nof this kind of in some ways is represented in the Bollywood hero. But\nwhat happens when the Bollywood hero becomes part of the stereotype of\na particular part of India, right? What happens when, when these\nstereotypes become? Become really normalized, right. So. So that is\ndefinitely a very challenging, challenging type of. Questioned answer, but\nit's obviously really terrible, right? It's really like. We are. We are on the one\nhand constantly as a nation told to to celebrate diversity. Celebration of\ndiversity, until very recently in India was built into the idea of citizenship,\nright? Yet, and and I have been saying so much throughout the semester,\nBollywood is really a lot of times telling us about the Indian nation, how to\nbe a good Indian, how to be a good or how to be a nation state in some\nways. And when you see examples like this, they really kind of, they really\nkind of break that discourse, right? So that is, that is one thing that we\nlearned from Chennai Express. Gunti teaches us something else. Ganti's\nreading is also very connected to how one looks and what those looks\nmean. Those looks are tied to socioeconomic status. Those looks are\nreplacing other people. Those looks actually have real life consequences for\nsomebody's life. I have a lot of other things tied to that, but a lot of those\nthings are also about how Bollywood is operating and how operating\nwithin Bollywood has become different. This, like it, tells us that there is\nsomething to be said for South Asian cinema, a Bollywood cinema, and the\nuse of language in that cinema. So obviously most of you are not native\nspeakers of Hindi and I would wager maybe one or 2% of you are. So for\nthose of us who are not, you obviously cannot hear the differences in how\npeople are. Using different accents of Hindi or people are using different\naccents of English in Hindi film. But the point that is being made here is all\nof those that are all of those uses of language actually mean something\nbeyond just using that language and they mean something on the screen.\nAnd they have consequences for how people look at themselves on screen\nand how they're represented on screen\"\n\nUsing only the lecture content, answer the following questions in a 150 word response\n1. Why is the representation of South Indian people problematic in Chennai Express?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The representation of South Indian people in Chennai Express is deemed problematic due to several reasons highlighted in the lecture. Firstly, the film perpetuates stereotypes by using skin color as a demarcation between North and South India, implicitly associating villainous traits with darker skin tones typically seen in South Indians. This is visually reinforced through the depiction of South Indian characters in a \"comically villainous\" manner, a stark contrast to the heroic portrayal of Shahrukh Khan's character, who represents North India. Moreover, Chennai Express fails to respect the diverse and rich cultural landscape of South India, instead opting for a homogenized and negative portrayal. Such representation not only misinterprets South Indian culture but also upholds damaging stereotypes that contribute to regional biases. This portrayal in a popular and influential medium like Bollywood contributes to the normalization of these stereotypes, posing serious implications for societal perceptions and inter-regional relations within India."}]}]}], "numConvs": 3}], "numConvs": 3}
