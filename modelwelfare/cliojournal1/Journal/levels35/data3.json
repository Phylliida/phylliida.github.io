Making your YouTube videos go viral involves a blend of content quality, understanding your audience, optimization, and promotion. Here's a structured strategy to help increase the virality potential of your videos:\n\n### 1. Understand Your Audience\n\n- **Define Your Niche:** Be clear about your target audience and what interests them. Specializing in a niche helps in creating focused content that resonates with your viewers.\n- **Engage with Your Viewers:** Reply to comments, ask for feedback, and understand what your audience likes or dislikes about your videos. Engagement increases loyalty and shareability.\n\n### 2. Create Compelling Content\n\n- **Focus on Value:** Whether educational, entertaining, or inspiring, your content must offer value that motivates viewers to share it.\n- **Optimize Your Intro:** You have about 15 seconds to hook your audience. Make sure your intros are engaging and clearly state the video's value.\n- **Storytelling:** People love stories. Craft your content with a clear beginning, middle, and end to keep viewers engaged.\n- **High-Quality Production:** Invest in good lighting, sound, and editing. Quality content stands out and is more shareable.\n  \n### 3. Optimize for YouTube\n\n- **SEO:** Use relevant keywords in your title, description, and tags. Look at what successful competitors are using but avoid keyword stuffing.\n- **Thumbnail:** Create eye-catching and relevant thumbnails. Thumbnails affect click-through rates significantly.\n- **Consistent Posting Schedule:** YouTube favors channels that regularly post content because it keeps users on the platform longer.\n\n### 4. Promote Your Videos\n\n- **Social Media:** Share your videos on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and relevant forums and groups. Tailor your message to each platform.\n- **Collaborations:** Collaborate with other YouTubers in your niche. This introduces your channel to a wider audience.\n- **Email List:** If you have an email list, send out notifications when you post new content.\n\n### 5. Analyze and Adapt\n\n- **YouTube Analytics:** Use YouTube Analytics to track the performance of your videos. Look at watch time, click-through rate, engagement, and demographics. \n- **Learn and Adapt:** Identify what works and what doesn\u2019t. Be prepared to pivot or tweak your content strategy based on insights from your analytics. \n\n### Miscellaneous Tips\n\n- **Chase Trends with a Twist:** Jumping on trending topics can get you quick views. Always try to add something unique that fits your niche.\n- **Community and Challenge Tags:** Engage with the larger YouTube community by participating in challenges, tags, or by commenting on other videos.\n- **In-video Promotions:** Encourage viewers to like, share, and subscribe in your videos. A simple reminder can significantly increase engagement.\n  \nRemember, virality often involves a degree of luck, but by consistently producing high-quality, targeted content and promoting it smartly, you increase your chances significantly. Stay adaptive, monitor trends, and always look for ways to innovate within your niche."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user sought assistance in renaming YouTube video titles and series, providing detailed context about their content and audience.

These issues make some environmentalists cautious or outright opposed to the use of nuclear energy as a green alternative. \n\n### 1. **Radioactive Waste**\nThe issue of radioactive waste is a significant concern for many environmentalists. Nuclear reactors produce high-level radioactive waste that remains hazardous for thousands of years. The management and disposal of this waste pose long-term environmental challenges. There's fear of leakage, which could contaminate water and soil, harming ecosystems and human health.\n\n### 2. **Catastrophic Accidents**\nHigh-profile nuclear accidents like Chernobyl (1986) and Fukushima (2011) have highlighted the potential for catastrophic outcomes when things go wrong with nuclear energy. Such incidents release large amounts of radiation into the environment, leading to immediate and long-term health risks, ecological damage, and vast economic losses. Despite improvements in technology and safety protocols, the risk, however small, of catastrophic failure contributes to the resistance against nuclear energy.\n\n### 3. **Environmental Impact of Uranium Mining**\nUranium is the fuel most commonly used in nuclear reactors. Its mining, processing, and transportation can have significant environmental impacts. Uranium mining often involves open pit mining or in situ leach mining, both of which can lead to habitat destruction, soil and water contamination, and the emission of greenhouse gases and radioactive dust.\n\n### 4. **Nuclear Proliferation**\nThough not directly an environmental concern, the risk of nuclear proliferation is intertwined with the expansion of nuclear energy. The technology used for nuclear power can be very similar to that used for nuclear weapons. The spread of nuclear technology and materials increases the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation, which has broader implications for global safety and security, indirectly affecting environmental stability through the risk of nuclear conflict.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile nuclear energy offers substantial advantages, such as low greenhouse gas emissions during operation and the ability to produce large amounts of electricity from a small amount of fuel, these environmental and safety concerns are why some environmentalists remain skeptical or opposed. The debate continues, with some advocating for advanced nuclear technology as part of a clean energy future, while others argue for a focus on renewable sources like wind and solar, coupled with energy efficiency measures."}, {"role": "user", "content": "nuclear energy? 20 quetions title"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Creating engaging and informative video content around nuclear energy can captivate audiences and offer valuable insights into its complexities and controversies.

However, I can suggest several general strategies and places where you either might find discounted advertising rates or particularly effective advertising avenues for hemp products:\n\n1. **Social Media Influencer Marketing**: Partnering with social media influencers who focus on CBD, wellness, or hemp products can be cost-effective. Look for influencers with highly engaged audiences and negotiate deals based on your budget.\n\n2. **Programmatic Advertising**: Some platforms specialize in programmatic ads for CBD and hemp businesses. These can sometimes offer lower costs due to the specificity of the audience and adaptive pricing models.\n\n3. **Content Marketing and SEO**: Developing high-quality, informative blogs and articles about hemp and optimizing them for search engines can be a long-term, cost-effective strategy. It isn't an instant \"hot deal\" but can yield significant returns over time with a relatively low investment in content creation.\n\n4. **Email Marketing**: Collecting emails and conducting well-crafted email marketing campaigns can be highly efficient. Look for software providers offering deals for new signup or those specifically interested in supporting the CBD/hemp industry.\n\n5. **Local and Niche Print Publications**: Advertising in local or niche magazines can sometimes offer very competitive pricing. Publications focusing on wellness, local news, or specific hobbies that align with hemp usage might provide hot deals for advertisers.\n\n6. **Event Sponsorships**: Sponsoring local events, webinars, or workshops related to wellness and hemp can be effective. Event organizers often offer sponsorship packages at various price points.\n\n7. **Cross-Promotions and Partnerships**: Partner with non-competing businesses in the wellness or similar sectors for cross-promotions. This can be a cost-efficient way to reach a wider audience by sharing the costs.\n\n8. **Industry-Specific Platforms**: Websites, forums, and online communities dedicated to hemp, CBD, or wellness may offer advertising slots at competitive rates.\n\n9. **Pay-Per-Click Advertising**: While not always the cheapest, PPC campaigns on platforms that allow hemp advertising can be dialed in very precisely to target your ideal customers, often leading to a good return on investment if managed well.\n\n10. **Podcast Advertising**: Appearing on or advertising through podcasts related to wellness, natural health, or even hemp itself, can reach highly engaged audiences. Look for emerging podcasts seeking to grow their base, as they may offer introductory rates.\n\nRemember, the efficacy of these deals largely depends on the timing, audience targeting, and appealing messaging.

Keep an eye on Google's policy updates for opportunities.\n\n3. **Bing Ads**: Bing (Microsoft Advertising) sometimes allows CBD product advertising under specific conditions.

Look for mailing list providers offering deals or discounts.\n\n8. **Coupon and Deal Sites**: Platforms like Groupon or local deal sites may allow listings for hemp-based products, giving access to their large audience bases.\n\n9. **Affiliate Marketing Programs**: Create an affiliate program for your hemp products.

Hemp in Daily Life: Across the Spectrum\n\nHemp, a variant of the Cannabis sativa plant, has been rediscovered as a goldmine of nutritional and sustainable resources, making its way into our daily lives more prominently. Unlike its controversial cousin, hemp contains negligible amounts of THC, the psychoactive compound, making it a safe and legal option for a multitude of uses, from nutrition to clothing.\n\n### Nutritional Benefits:\n\nThe seeds of the hemp plant are tiny powerhouses of nutrition. Packed with a balanced blend of essential fatty acids, hemp seeds are a great source of omega-3 and omega-6, crucial for heart health and anti-inflammation. They're also rich in protein, providing all nine essential amino acids, making them a perfect protein source for vegetarians and vegans. Additionally, they are a good source of fiber, promoting digestive health. Integrating hemp seeds into your diet can support weight management, decrease heart disease risk, and enhance overall wellness.\n\n### Hemp in the Pantry:\n\nHemp seeds, hemp seed oil, and hemp protein powder are versatile ingredients that can easily enrich your diet. For a nutritious start to your day, sprinkle hemp seeds over your yogurt or blend hemp protein powder into your morning smoothie. Hemp seed oil, with its mild, nutty flavor, makes for an excellent base in salad dressings or a boost in your hummus. These simple integrations can significantly elevate the nutritional profile of your meals, supporting a healthy lifestyle with minimal effort.\n\n### Hemp Clothing:\n\nBeyond nutrition, hemp lends its virtues to the textile industry. Hemp fabric is renowned for its durability, breathability, and comfort. More importantly, its environmental footprint is astonishingly lower than cotton's, requiring less water and no pesticides to grow, making it a champion of sustainable fashion. Brands like Patagonia and Jungmaven have embraced hemp, offering clothing lines that are not only stylish but also kind to the planet. Opting for hemp clothing means investing in garments that last longer, feel better, and consciously reduce environmental harm.\n\nIncorporating hemp into your diet and wardrobe can significantly impact your health and the planet. As we rediscover hemp's myriad uses, it's clear that this ancient plant holds modern solutions for a sustainable and healthy lifestyle."}, {"role": "user", "content": "rewrite that in the style matching the following. \"Hey there, amazing new friends! \ud83c\udf3f Middle Guy couldn\u2019t be happier to welcome you into our joyous realm of hemp. If you\u2019ve been searching for a spot that\u2019s buzzing with the marvels of hemp, minus the usual spiel, congrats, you\u2019ve struck gold!\n\nDid you know? Hemp is the unsung hero of sustainable living. Yes, indeed! This wonder plant is making a big splash, cutting down on water and chemical use, and showing us a greener path forward. And with laws evolving, the globe is waking up to hemp\u2019s boundless potential. Pretty thrilling, right?\n\nBut hemp\u2019s goodness doesn\u2019t stop with the planet. It\u2019s here to boost our health, spice up our meals, and revitalize our skincare with a burst of nature\u2019s best. Eager to elevate your wellness journey with a touch of cool? Hemp\u2019s got your back.\n\nFor the creatives and the fashion-forward among us, we\u2019re taking a deep dive into how hemp can add that extra flair to your DIY projects and wardrobe choices. And let\u2019s not skip over the buzz around CBD - it\u2019s the wellness trend that everyone\u2019s talking about for all the right reasons.\n\nAt Middle Guy, we\u2019re all about sharing the finest slices of the hemp universe \u2013 from inspiring tales of hemp heroes to the freshest hemp headlines. We keep it engaging, authentic, and oh-so-informative because that\u2019s just how we like it.\n\nI. Hemp\u2019s Environmental Footprint\n\nDiving into the heart of what makes hemp a true environmental ally, let\u2019s talk sustainability. This resilient plant plays the long game with our planet, demanding significantly less from our precious resources than its agricultural counterparts. Unlike the water-thirsty cotton, hemp asks for relatively little H2O to flourish. Picture this: while cotton gulps down water, hemp sips it conservatively, illustrating a path towards more sustainable farming practices.\n\nBut hemp doesn\u2019t stop at just being low maintenance. It puts on a superhero cape when it comes to pesticides. While many crops rely heavily on chemical help to grow, hemp stands strong on its own, warding off pests with its natural defenses. This not only means cleaner products for us but also less chemical runoff polluting our waterways.\n\nThen there\u2019s the incredible power of biodegradability. Hemp products naturally break down, returning to the earth without a trace. Unlike synthetics that languish in landfills, hemp offers us products that live a full, useful life and then discreetly bow out, reducing waste and lessening our environmental footprint. This thoughtful cycle reflects hemp\u2019s respect for nature\u2019s rhythms, making it a standout example of true ecological harmony.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget carbon sequestration - hemp\u2019s secret weapon against climate change. As it grows, hemp captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, locking it away in its fibers and the soil. This remarkable process not only helps clear our air but also enriches the soil for future crops. In the grand circle of life, hemp ensures that it leaves the earth richer than it found it, making it an invaluable player in our quest for a greener future.\n\nHemp in Daily Life: Across the Spectrum\n\nAs we weave hemp into the fabric of our daily lives, it\u2019s impossible to overlook its rich bounty of nutritional benefits. Imagine a tiny hemp seed, unassuming yet packed with the power to transform our health. These small but mighty seeds are a treasure trove of protein, essential for building and repairing muscle. They\u2019re rich in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, champions for heart health and beautiful, glowing skin. And let\u2019s not forget fiber, that unsung hero of digestion carried in abundance by hemp seeds. It\u2019s nature\u2019s way of bringing balance and wellness into our lives, encapsulated in a seed.\n\nBringing hemp into the pantry introduces a world of possibilities for both health and taste. Hemp seeds, with their nutty essence, can sprinkle a crunchy zest over salads or blend seamlessly into smoothies. Hemp oil, rich and smooth, dresses dishes in its healthy glow, while hemp protein powder offers a plant-based boost to post-workout shakes or morning pancakes.\n\nLet\u2019s venture into a simple culinary indulgence: a hemp seed pesto. Blend a generous handful of hemp seeds, fresh basil, garlic, parmesan, and a drizzle of hemp oil until smooth. It\u2019s not just pesto; it\u2019s a heart-healthy, flavorful journey with each bite. Or, for an energizing start to your day, add a scoop of hemp protein powder into your breakfast smoothie. Banana, almond milk, a dash of cinnamon, and hemp protein \u2013 it\u2019s like a morning hug for your body.\n\nIn the panorama of our daily eating habits, introducing hemp is like inviting wellness, taste, and nutrition to sit at the table.

Hemp is the unsung hero of sustainable living. Yes, indeed! This wonder plant is making a big splash, cutting down on water and chemical use, and showing us a greener path forward. And with laws evolving, the globe is waking up to hemp\u2019s boundless potential. Pretty thrilling, right?\n\nBut hemp\u2019s goodness doesn\u2019t stop with the planet. It\u2019s here to boost our health, spice up our meals, and revitalize our skincare with a burst of nature\u2019s best. Eager to elevate your wellness journey with a touch of cool? Hemp\u2019s got your back.\n\nFor the creatives and the fashion-forward among us, we\u2019re taking a deep dive into how hemp can add that extra flair to your DIY projects and wardrobe choices. And let\u2019s not skip over the buzz around CBD - it\u2019s the wellness trend that everyone\u2019s talking about for all the right reasons.\n\nAt Middle Guy, we\u2019re all about sharing the finest slices of the hemp universe \u2013 from inspiring tales of hemp heroes to the freshest hemp headlines. We keep it engaging, authentic, and oh-so-informative because that\u2019s just how we like it.\n\nI. Hemp\u2019s Environmental Footprint\n\nDiving into the heart of what makes hemp a true environmental ally, let\u2019s talk sustainability. This resilient plant plays the long game with our planet, demanding significantly less from our precious resources than its agricultural counterparts. Unlike the water-thirsty cotton, hemp asks for relatively little H2O to flourish. Picture this: while cotton gulps down water, hemp sips it conservatively, illustrating a path towards more sustainable farming practices.\n\nBut hemp doesn\u2019t stop at just being low maintenance. It puts on a superhero cape when it comes to pesticides. While many crops rely heavily on chemical help to grow, hemp stands strong on its own, warding off pests with its natural defenses. This not only means cleaner products for us but also less chemical runoff polluting our waterways.\n\nThen there\u2019s the incredible power of biodegradability. Hemp products naturally break down, returning to the earth without a trace. Unlike synthetics that languish in landfills, hemp offers us products that live a full, useful life and then discreetly bow out, reducing waste and lessening our environmental footprint. This thoughtful cycle reflects hemp\u2019s respect for nature\u2019s rhythms, making it a standout example of true ecological harmony.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget carbon sequestration - hemp\u2019s secret weapon against climate change. As it grows, hemp captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, locking it away in its fibers and the soil. This remarkable process not only helps clear our air but also enriches the soil for future crops. In the grand circle of life, hemp ensures that it leaves the earth richer than it found it, making it an invaluable player in our quest for a greener future.\n\nII. Hemp in Daily Life: Across the Spectrum\n\nAs we weave hemp into the fabric of our daily lives, it\u2019s impossible to overlook its rich bounty of nutritional benefits. Imagine a tiny hemp seed, unassuming yet packed with the power to transform our health. These small but mighty seeds are a treasure trove of protein, essential for building and repairing muscle. They\u2019re rich in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, champions for heart health and beautiful, glowing skin. And let\u2019s not forget fiber, that unsung hero of digestion carried in abundance by hemp seeds. It\u2019s nature\u2019s way of bringing balance and wellness into our lives, encapsulated in a seed.\n\nBringing hemp into the pantry introduces a world of possibilities for both health and taste. Hemp seeds, with their nutty essence, can sprinkle a crunchy zest over salads or blend seamlessly into smoothies. Hemp oil, rich and smooth, dresses dishes in its healthy glow, while hemp protein powder offers a plant-based boost to post-workout shakes or morning pancakes.\n\nLet\u2019s venture into a simple culinary indulgence: a hemp seed pesto. Blend a generous handful of hemp seeds, fresh basil, garlic, parmesan, and a drizzle of hemp oil until smooth. It\u2019s not just pesto; it\u2019s a heart-healthy, flavorful journey with each bite. Or, for an energizing start to your day, add a scoop of hemp protein powder into your breakfast smoothie. Banana, almond milk, a dash of cinnamon, and hemp protein \u2013 it\u2019s like a morning hug for your body.\n\nIn the panorama of our daily eating habits, introducing hemp is like inviting wellness, taste, and nutrition to sit at the table. It turns meals into nutrient-packed celebrations, effortlessly blending health into every bite. Let hemp nourish your body, soul, and every meal with its simple, profound goodness.\n\nHey everyone! \ud83c\udf3f Welcome back to Middle Guy, where we\u2019re continuing our adventure into the fascinating world of hemp with some of the coolest, most innovative products yet. If you thought the story of hemp ended with seeds and textiles, you\u2019re in for a treat. Today, we\u2019re exploring how this versatile plant is making its mark in areas you might not have expected. So, let\u2019s dive right into these exciting developments!\n\nHemp Plastic Alternatives:\n\nImagine unpacking your shopping and knowing that the plastic-like material it\u2019s wrapped in won\u2019t end up polluting the oceans. This is the promise of hemp bioplastics. Made from hemp, these bioplastics offer a more earth-friendly alternative to traditional plastics. They\u2019re designed to biodegrade, meaning they can break down naturally, contributing less to pollution. The idea of packaging materials that harmlessly return to the earth is not only appealing but increasingly necessary for our planet\u2019s health.\n\nHemp in Construction: Hempcrete:\n\nNow let\u2019s talk about building materials. Hempcrete is making waves in the construction industry as a sustainable option for building. Made by mixing hemp\u2019s woody fibers with lime and water, this material boasts excellent insulation properties and is also carbon-negative. This means it absorbs more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits during production. Using hempcrete for building is more than just choosing an eco-friendly material; it\u2019s about lowering the carbon footprint of construction projects.\n\nInnovative Hemp Products:\n\nAnd the innovation doesn\u2019t stop there. Hemp is also being transformed into eco-conscious paper, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional wood-based paper and helping to reduce deforestation. Then there are hemp biofuels, presenting a cleaner-burning option compared to fossil fuels, and even hemp batteries, which are exploring the plant\u2019s potential in energy storage. These developments are not just about creating eco-friendly products; they\u2019re about finding more responsible ways to meet our needs.\n\nEach of these inventive hemp products showcases the plant\u2019s broad potential to contribute to a sustainable lifestyle. As we explore these new applications, we\u2019re reminded of the importance of making choices that are better for the planet. Hemp is leading the way in offering those alternatives, and here at Middle Guy, we\u2019re excited to keep sharing these stories with you.\n\nSo, stay tuned as we continue to uncover the incredible possibilities of hemp, bringing you the latest in sustainable living and innovation, one post at a time. \ud83c\udf0d\n\nHey everyone! \ud83c\udf3f It\u2019s Middle Guy here again, guiding you through the ever-expanding universe of hemp.

Whether you\u2019re a seasoned hemp enthusiast or a curious newcomer, understanding how to choose and use hemp products can significantly impact your green lifestyle. So, let\u2019s break it down!\n\nQuality and Certification:\n\nFirst off, not all hemp products are created equal. The quality can vary widely, so it\u2019s essential to know how to spot the top-tier stuff. Look for certifications on the packaging. Certifications like USDA Organic or certifications specific to the country of origin can be a good indicator of quality. These labels ensure that the products meet stringent standards, from the way the hemp was grown to how the final product was produced.\n\nAnother tip? Do a bit of research on the brand. Companies that are transparent about their sourcing and manufacturing processes are often the ones who take the quality of their hemp products seriously. Check out their websites or reach out to them directly with any questions. Trustworthy brands are usually more than happy to share their story and product details with you.\n\nIncorporating Hemp into Your Lifestyle:\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about weaving hemp into the fabric of your daily life. You don\u2019t have to do a complete overhaul; even small changes can make a difference. Here\u2019s how you can begin:\n\nIn Your Diet: Start by adding hemp seeds to your diet, as they\u2019re an easy entry point. Sprinkle them on salads, blend them into smoothies, or mix them into your morning yogurt. Hemp seeds are not only nutritious but also have a mild, nutty flavor that complements a variety of dishes.\n\nIn Your Skincare: Swap out some of your regular skincare products for those made with hemp oil. Hemp oil is known for its moisturizing properties and can be a game-changer for your skin. Look for lotions, balms, or even soaps that list hemp oil among their ingredients.\n\nIn Your Closet: Consider hemp-based clothing and textiles. Not only are they sustainable, but they also offer comfort and durability. Hemp fabric tends to get softer with each wash, making it a fantastic choice for everyday wear. Start with something simple like a hemp t-shirt or a pair of socks and feel the difference for yourself.\n\nRemember, incorporating hemp into your lifestyle doesn\u2019t have to be daunting. It\u2019s all about making conscious choices that align with your values and lifestyle needs. Whether you\u2019re drawn to hemp for its environmental benefits or its nutritional value, there\u2019s a myriad of ways to embrace this versatile plant in your life.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a wrap on our guide to navigating the market and incorporating hemp into your daily routine.

What is shopify and how can i use it on my wix based online retail store? in a step by step breakdown tell me how to make that work. no fluff."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! If you're running an online retail store on Wix but interested in integrating Shopify for its e-commerce capabilities, here's a simplified step-by-step breakdown on how to make that integration work. Bear in mind, Shopify and Wix are separate platforms, and direct integration is limited. However, you can use Shopify's Buy Button or create a workaround.\n\n### Step 1: Create a Shopify Account\n- Go to Shopify's website and sign up for an account.\n- Follow the setup process to launch your Shopify store. Even if you're primarily using Wix, you'll need a Shopify store to manage products and payments.\n\n### Step 2: Set Up Your Products in Shopify\n- Once your Shopify account is ready, add your products to the Shopify store.\n- Configure your product details, including images, descriptions, prices, and inventory.\n\n### Step 3: Use Shopify's Buy Button\n- The most straightforward integration between Wix and Shopify is through Shopify's \"Buy Button\".\n- In your Shopify dashboard, navigate to the \"Sales Channels\" section and add the \"Buy Button\" sales channel.\n- Customize your Buy Button for the products or collections you want to sell through your Wix site. Shopify allows you to customize the button's appearance and shopping cart options.\n\n### Step 4: Embed the Shopify Buy Button on Your Wix Site\n- After customizing your Buy Button in Shopify, you'll be provided with an embeddable code.\n- Log in to your Wix site's editor.\n- Add a new section to your site where you want the Shopify Buy Button to appear. You can use the \"+Add\" button on Wix, then choose \"More\" and select \"HTML iframe\" or \"Embed a Site\".\n- Paste the embed code from Shopify into the HTML code snippet or iframe box.\n- Adjust the size of the embed box as needed to fit your design.\n- Save your changes and publish your site.\n\n### Step 5: Test Your Integration\n- Visit your Wix site and navigate to the page with the embedded Shopify Buy Button.\n- Test the buying process to ensure everything works smoothly\u2014the button should open a Shopify-powered checkout when clicked.\n\n### Step 6: Redirect for Full Catalog\n- If you wish to use Shopify for the full catalog instead of individual Buy Buttons, create a navigation link in Wix that redirects users to your Shopify store.\n- This can be a temporary workaround till you decide if moving fully to Shopify is more beneficial.\n\n### Step 7: Keep Both Platforms Updated\n- Any changes you make to product details on Shopify should manually be updated in Wix, whether through new embed codes for Buy Buttons or product information, to ensure consistency.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n- Keep SEO in mind; having products on Shopify might affect your Wix site's SEO.\n- Evaluate the cost-benefit analysis, as maintaining two platforms might increase your operational costs.\n\n### Conclusion\nIntegrating Shopify with a Wix site mainly through the Buy Button allows you to leverage Shopify's powerful e-commerce capabilities without fully migrating from Wix. However, it requires a bit of manual setup and management. This setup is ideal for sellers who prefer Wix for content and Shopify for e-commerce functionalities."}, {"role": "user", "content": "pretend to be a helpful research assistant who is to the point, no fluff.

Its use dates back thousands of years, with ancient civilizations recognizing its value for making textiles, rope, and even paper. However, despite its myriad uses, hemp fell out of favor in the modern era due to regulatory challenges and associations with its psychoactive cousin. Today, we're witnessing a global resurgence in hemp cultivation and usage, driven by an increased understanding of its environmental benefits and its potential to contribute to sustainable living practices.\n\nHemp\u2019s ecological footprint is remarkably light compared to that of other crops. It's a robust plant that requires minimal water, no pesticides, and naturally enriches the soil it\u2019s planted in, making it a champion of eco-friendly agriculture. Moreover, hemp sequesters carbon, actively reducing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This capability positions hemp as a critical ally in the fight against climate change, underscoring its relevance in today\u2019s environmentally conscious society.\n\nThe diversity of hemp products available today is astonishing. From textiles, food, and biofuels to construction materials and bioplastics, hemp's applications are nearly limitless. Nutritionally, hemp seeds are a powerhouse, packed with essential fatty acids, proteins, and minerals. In the realm of textiles, hemp fabric offers a durable, breathable, and antimicrobial option for clothing. Innovatively, hemp is making waves in the construction industry through hempcrete, a sustainable building material distinguished by its insulation properties and carbon negativity.\n\nAs we delve deeper into the realm of sustainable living, embracing hemp and its multifaceted benefits offers a pathway to a greener, more sustainable future.

Hemp seems one of the most relevant gluten-free crop plants to meet such requirements. Its high nutritional value is comparable to soy. Moreover, almost the whole body of the hemp plant has a wide array of utility: industrial production of food, fiber, and construction materials. In view of environmental sustainability, hemp requires less pesticides or water in cultivation compared to cotton, a representative fiber plant. This short review investigates hemp\u2019s sustainability as a plant as well as its utility value as a highly nutritional material in the food industry. Recent application research of hemp protein in food processing includes plant milk, emulsifiers, fortification of gluten-free bread, plant-based meat production, as well as membrane formation. These studies have revealed distinctive properties of hemp protein, especially in relation to disulfide (S-S)/sulfhydryl (-SH)-mediated interactions with protein from other sources. While its cultivation area and industrial use were limited for a while over confusion with marijuana, the market for industrial hemp is growing rapidly because it has been highly reevaluated in multiple areas of industry. Conclusively, with its sustainability as a plant as well as its distinctive useful property of the seed protein, hemp has promising value in the development of new foods.\n\nKeywords: disulfide, food processing, gluten free, hemp, high protein food, sustainability, meat analogue\nGo to:\n1. Introduction\nThe industrial revolution has rapidly enhanced the standard of living. However, large-scale factory production as well as modernization of agriculture have caused serious environmental problems which now threaten the existence of human beings [1]. Global warming has raised water deficiency problems [2]. Long-term use of pesticides in agriculture brought severe environmental pollution [3]. Moreover, the explosive growth of the world population and increasing number of meat-eaters not only imbalanced the supply/demand of livestock meat but also accelerated the food crisis [4]. Thus, in 2015, the United Nations adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and quoted that development must balance social, economic, and environmental sustainability. Moreover, the prevailing COVID-19 situation and the Russia\u2013Ukraine conflict remind us of the importance of food security [5,6,7]. Now, the food industry seeks protein sources from plants rather than from livestock animals as the plant cultivation poses less impact on the environment [8,9]. Hemp and its industrial products look to be one of the prospective keys in developing sustainable and resilient food systems [10]. In the viewpoint of cultivation, hemp has a short cropping period [11] and needs less pesticide or water compared to cotton [12], a representative fiber material plant. Moreover, the whole body of the hemp plant\u2014its leaves, stalks, roots, and seeds\u2014are utilizable without waste [13]. Furthermore, hemp seeds are comparable with soybeans in terms of nutrition [14].\n\nHemp has historically close relations with humans. Industrial hemp has long been used in various civilizations and religions since ancient times to the present day [15]. In Japan, a Shinto priest uses cannabis leaves to purge and bless the worshippers in a shrine where thick ceremonial hemp ropes are displayed. In the practical viewpoint, hemp played outstanding roles, especially in the Age of Exploration, as an essential material to make durable canvas and ropes for sailing ships. Later, in the World Wars era, the United States made full use of hemp as a reliable material to cover a shortfall of essential fiber products such as military uniforms and shoelaces, as well as parachutes while fully engaged in combat [16]. However, for a period of time, confusion with marijuana has limited the cultivation area and industrial use of hemp. Now, due to its sustainable growth characteristics as well as its versatile industrial usability, hemp is reevaluated as a promising crop in the era of SDGs [11]. The stalk is for fiber production, the leaves/roots for medicine, and seeds for oil until nothing is left. Moreover, its high nutritional value is comparable to soy and its unique characteristics in food processing appear to be high-profile in the food industry. Moreover, with its gluten content as low as 4.78 ppm, it is attracting attention as a gluten-free (<20 ppm) food material [17]. Oil meal, a residual material of hemp seed after expression of hemp oil, is a useful protein-rich material [18]. Recent application of hemp protein in food processing reveals its unique properties. Especially, in recent studies, its cysteine-rich amino acid composition and high sulfhydryl (-SH)/disulfide (S-S) ratio offer a glimpse of its distinctive features useful in food processing [19]. This short review verifies the usefulness of hemp focusing on its sustainability as a plant as well as its usability as a versatile food material. The authors also briefly introduce the historical relationship between human and hemp.\n\nGo to:\n2. A Brief History of Hemp Cultivation in the World\nA recent study based on genome-wide phylogeography supports the leading hypothesis that Cannabis sativa was first domesticated in East Asia in the early Neolithic era [20]. Ren et al. [20] demonstrated that all current hemp and drug cultivars diverged from an ancestral gene pool currently represented by feral plants and landraces in China. Cannabis sativa, or \u201cuseful hemp\u201d in Latin, is categorized into non-drug type hemp and drug type marijuana depending on the content of psychoactive compound delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) [21]. Industrial hemp contains only about 0.3\u20131.5% of THC, whereas marijuana contains 5\u201310% or more of THC. Hemp contains cannabidiol (CBD), a non-intoxicating phytocannabinoid, which has high medicinal potential in some conditions, such as difficult-to-treat seizures in children and adults [22].\n\nThe history of hemp and human society is long and complex\u2014from being an essential commodity fiber crop in the Age of Discovery to its widespread prohibition under the umbrella of marijuana in the 20th century. The oldest known fossil pollen record compatible with cannabis was found in rocks 19.6 million years old (Early Miocene) from the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau (presently China), which has been proposed as the center of origin of cannabis [23]. There, hemp has been grown for 4000 and 6000 years for the production of textiles and fiber. However, in 1985, China banned the production of hemp after it ratified the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances [24]. Hemp production became legal again in 2010, and now the Chinese government encourages the textile industry, such as the Youngor Group, to manufacture hemp fiber products [25]. Although official data for China\u2019s hemp cultivation and production are unavailable, industry estimated China\u2019s hemp planted area at around 66,700 hectares (165,000 acres) in 2019. China\u2019s hemp market value was also estimated at USD 1.7 billion in 2017 [24].\n\nHemp is also grown across Europe. The cultivation area in the EU has increased significantly from 19,970 to 34,960 ha between 2015 and 2019. The production of hemp increased from 94,120 to 152,820 tons in the same period. France is the leading hemp cultivator, making up for more than 70% of the overall EU production, followed by the Netherlands (10%) and Austria (4%) [26]. In the UK, in 1533, King Henry VIII mandated every farmer to cultivate hemp, a useful source of tough fiber to produce naval equipment such as rope, canvas, and sails to protect the land surrounded by the ocean [27]. However, in 1961, the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs banned all forms of cannabis in the US and in Western Europe (except France) because of the confusion between hemp and marijuana. Note, as an aside, that Boris Johnson mentioned climate protesters as \u201chemp-smelling bivouacs\u201d [28].\n\nHemp has played critical roles in American history. The Declaration of Independence was drafted on hemp paper. George Washington, the first president of the US, was to be found exhorting his head gardener to: \u201cMake the most of the Indian hemp seed\u2026and sow it everywhere\u201d [29]. Federal restrictions on use or sale of cannabis first occurred with the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 (\u201cthe Act\u201d) following the repeal of the National Prohibition Act that prohibited the production, importation, transportation, and sale of alcohol from 1920 to 1933. The Marihuana Tax Act imposed registration requirements and a tax on growers, sellers, and buyers of marijuana [30]. However, during wartime, the US government relied on hemp to make twine, tarred cordage, nets, shoelaces, carpets, and parachutes. After World War II, hemp has been cultivated in very small amounts and eventually found itself \u201cunjustly imprisoned\u201d [16] under the negative influence of its sister plant, marijuana. In 2018, the Federal Farm Bill has legalized hemp as an agricultural commodity and removed it from the controlled substances list [31]. Now, as of 2020, the US seems to be the world\u2019s largest producer of industrial hemp with a licensed area of 465,787 acres [32].\n\nThe world market of industrial hemp was estimated to be USD 4.13 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow by a 16.8% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2022 and 2030 [33]. Growing demand for industrial hemp from a wide variety of application industries drives the market [34]. While the global market is undergoing limited growth under the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is expected to grow at a faster rate with the high recovery rate of global economies [33].\n\nGo to:\n3. Reevaluation of Hemp for Its Sustainability\nHemp has received a lot of attention because of its multipurpose usability, short production cycle, and low capital demand in cultivation, possibility as a carbon-negative material [11]. Here, recent examples are introduced to show how hemp is excellent as SDG-applicable materials.\n\n3.1. Cellulose Gap: Applications in the Textile Industry\nDuring the Age of Exploration, hemp was a critical crop in Europe for the production of strong fiber suitable for canvas and ropes for sailing vessels. However, around the 18th century, cotton had become popular and had taken over the role as the principal fiber plant. Cotton fiber has a soft and comforting touch because cellulose of high crystallinity and purity compose the cell wall [35]. Now, the \u201ccellulose gap\u201d, an excessively high demand for natural fiber not being met by cotton production, encourages textile manufacturers to seek substitutes for cotton [12,36]. Moreover, while cotton is grown on only 2.4% of the cropland in the world, its cultivation uses 11% of the world\u2019s pesticides [37]. Industrial hemp is one of the most relevant substitutes for cotton because it requires less pesticides and water in cultivation [12]. Duque Schumacher et al. [38] has demonstrated that hemp requires only one-third of the land area occupied by cotton to produce the same amount of fiber while cotton needs 2.5 times more water than hemp per unit cultivation area. Duque Schumacher et al. [38] concluded that in terms of agricultural activities for fiber production, hemp costs only one-twelfth of the cost for cotton. Especially, the \u2018Henola\u2019 variety has a shorter growing period as well as higher seed productivity, and thus looks preferable for introduction and cultivation [39].\n\nMeanwhile, hemp fiber is known as coarse and stiff. It also has poor spinnability in the ring spinning system [40]. The blended use of cotton/hemp fibers for denim fabrics improved the thermo-physiological comfort as well as the soft-feeling nature. Moreover, higher air ventilation, higher water-absorbing property, and faster drying behavior were observed in the mixed fabrics compared to a pure cotton fabric [41].\n\n3.2. Hempcrete\nHemp concrete or \u201chempcrete\u201d is made of lime, water, and hemp shives, a by-product of fiber processing from hemp stalk. It is a bio-composite material used as an alternative to concrete for construction and insulation. Hempcrete is \u201ccarbon-negative\u201d or \u201cbetter-than-zero-carbon\u201d because hemp plant absorbs more carbon from the air during growth than it yields during its production. Moreover, it continues to absorb carbon after being employed in construction, storing more carbon over the building\u2019s lifetime than was emitted during construction [42]. In 2021, Pierre Chevet Sports Centre was built in France as the first public building using hemp concrete as the main construction material [43]. Moreover, preliminary 3D-printing research shows that hempcrete is printable with a density as low as 660 kg/m3, with adequate buildability and compressive strength for printing individual walls [44]. Such technical progress will widen the uses of hemp and the possibility to alleviate the negative impact of the construction industry on the environment.\n\n3.3. Biofuels\nHuman activities in industry and transportation have resulted in an extensive use of fossil fuels, negatively affecting the environment causing climate change, as well as global warming. Bioenergy is a green alternative for diverse energy needs. Thus, novel technology realizing effective conversion processes must be developed to enhance affordable biofuel production [45]. Marrot et al. [46] investigated the influence of the thermochemical conversion processing parameters on energy production as well as electrical conductivity. Two distinct scenarios of hemp biomass valorization were proposed, depending mainly on the selective pyrolysis temperature. Hemp biochar carbonized at 400\u2013600 \u00b0C was classified as a lignocellulosic material with good potential for solid biofuel applications due to its high heating value. In contrast, hemp biochar carbonized at 800\u20131000 \u00b0C developed a graphite-like microstructure and displayed interesting electrical conductivity, opening doors for its use in electrical purposes.\n\n3.4. Bioplastics\nPetroleum-based plastics cause many environmental problems, such as marine pollution, human health problems, and greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, bioplastics are drawing attention as alternatives to conventional ones [47]. Short hemp fiber is used to recycle polypropylene from textile wastes into wood plastic composites [48]. Cast hemp paper is laminated with bio-based plastics for sustainable packaging [49]. Hydrothermal and mechanically generated hemp hurd nanofibers are utilized for sustainable barrier coatings/films [50]. Hemp-based fiber is being applied even to the interior of high-end vehicles [51]. Hemp-reinforced natural fibers have been used in the interior components of the Mercedes-Benz E-Class. A significant portion of the Lotus ECO Elise\u2019s body panels are manufactured using hemp fiber-reinforced polyester composite.\n\nGo to:\n4. Nutrition\n4.1. Overview\nThe nutritional value of hemp is attracting attention [14]. Hemp seed is composed of a white kernel and brown hull (Figure 1). The kernel is rich in protein, unsaturated fatty acid, and dietary fiber [52]. Hemp shares a unique high-protein, low-carbohydrate nutritional composition with soybean, distinctively different from other representative food materials such as rice and wheat, the protein/carbohydrate (%, w/w) content of which is 7.17/77.55 [53] and 10.6/73.2 [54], respectively. Hemp and soy are also rich in dietary fiber and unsaturated fatty acids (Table 1). Hemp oil is popular and the oil meal, a by-product of oil processing, is utilized in many protein-rich foods as well as animal feeds [55].\n\nAn external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.\nObject name is foods-12-00651-g001.jpg\nFigure 1\nWhole (a) and dehulled hemp seed (b).

[39] and Kan et al. [56].\n\n4.2. Protein\n4.2.1. Composition of Hemp Protein (Globulin, Albumin, and Others) The major protein in hemp kernel is edestin, accounting for around 70% of hemp protein. Edestin is a hexamer of identical subunits and belongs to the globulin family [57]. Each subunit consists of the acidic (\u221234 kDa) and the basic (18\u201320 kDa) chains [58]. An original single protein is cleaved into these two chains post-translationally at the Asn-Gly site [57]. An edestin subunit has five cysteine residues, two of which form a single intermolecular disulfide bond between basic and acidic subunits. The acidic subunit has one intramolecular disulfide bond. The remaining cysteine has a free sulfhydryl (SH) group. Edestin is less soluble in water or buffer with neutral or acidic pH, but soluble in a basic buffer [59]. As solubility in water and content of free SHs increases by sonication or pH adjustment of the edestin solution, control of the protein structure/function may be possible in food processing [60]. Despite its less solubility, edestin is known for its high digestibility [61,62].\nThe second major hemp protein is albumin, which has fewer disulfide bonds compared to edestin (globulin), thus having a flexible structure with higher protein solubility and foaming capacity [59]. Another noteworthy protein is rich in Met and Cys, and 20 mole % of the total amino acids contain sulfur [63]. It consists of two subunits made of 27 and 61 amino acid residues, respectively, which are held together by two intermolecular disulfide bonds [63].\n\n4.2.2. Extractability/Solubility Recently, reverse micelles (RMs) technology has been applied for protein extraction as it is convenient and cost-effective [64]. Protein extraction by RMs is achieved via two steps: \u201cforward and backward\u201d extractions. In the forward extraction, soluble proteins are encapsulated in the inner aqueous core of RMs, which are then recovered in the backward extraction by disrupting the RMs. Protein extraction from hemp flour using RMs did not require prior defatting in terms of extraction performance [65]. Hemp protein isolates obtained from non-defatted and defatted hemp flour shared similarities in proximate composition, subunit structure, as well as principal properties of protein including solubility, isoelectric point, emulsifying/foaming abilities, and thermal stability. Meanwhile, protein from non-defatted flour exhibited higher \u03b2-sheet content and surface hydrophobicity. Furthermore, higher least gelling concentration and higher gel strength were observed in the gel formed by protein from non-defatted hemp flour [65].\n4.2.3. Digestibility/Allergenicity In vitro digestion tests demonstrated that hemp protein has a high degree of digestibility [61]. Moreover, most hemp allergens, such as the major thaumatin-like protein and lipid transfer protein, were eliminated in the protein-isolation or digestion processes. Mamone et al. [61] concluded that hemp protein is usable as an ingredient for hypoallergenic foods.\n4.2.4. Disulfide Structure Hemp protein has a unique feature in view of the disulfide structure. It shows much higher free sulfhydryl content than soy protein [66]. The cysteine content of hemp protein is 1.6\u20131.4 g cysteine/100 g protein [32,67], higher than pea (1.0 g cysteine/100 g protein) and broadbean or soybean (1.1\u20131.3 g cysteine/100 g protein) [68]. Moreover, at pH 8, while the free sulfhydryl content of soy protein is 1.6 \u00d7 106 mol/g protein, the counterpart of hemp is as high as 3.9 \u00d7 106 mol/g protein [66]. Tang et al. [66] discussed that the poor functional properties of hemp protein seems mostly ascribed to the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds between individual proteins and subsequent aggregation at neutral or acidic pH, because it has a high free sulfhydryl content. Meanwhile, exchange reactions between disulfide (S-S) and free SH play critical roles in the cereal biology [69] as well as food processing [70,71]. In the preparation of microparticles made from soy protein isolate and egg white, the egg white protein serves as a free sulfhydryl \u201cdonor\u201d to accelerate intermolecular S-S linkage with the soy protein [72]. Thus, hemp protein with a high free SH content should have unexplored unique processing characteristics. Heat-dependent formation of the envelope made of hemp and soy protein is just a glimpse of this attribute [73,74].\nGo to:\n5. Applications of Hemp Protein to the Food Processing Industry\n5.1. Hemp Milk\nIncreasing demand for plant-based milk has enlarged its industry due to lactose intolerance, cow\u2019s milk allergy, and vegan lifestyles [75]. The principal predictor of dairy consumption in the acceptance of dairy products was \u201cNice\u201d, relative to the other 3Ns, that are, Natural, Necessary, and Normal. \u201cTaste\u201d was the most relevant keyword in consumers\u2019 selection of dairy products [76]. Hemp milk, with its highly nutritional value and low allergenicity, looks to be an attractive alternative to dairy, soy, and nut milks. Comparison of milk products in the market reveals hemp milk as a better source of minerals than other dairy and plant milks. Hemp milk does not taste that different but has a \u201cnuttier\u201d flavor in comparison to soy or rice milk [77]. High pressure homogenization following pH adjustment realized non-thermally processed hemp milk, which is remarkably stable, showing negligible phase separation in storage for 3 days at 4 \u00b0C [78].\n\n5.2. Emulsifier\nStabilization of emulsion-based colloidal structures by food ingredients has attracted attention in the food and pharmaceutical, as well as cosmetic, industries [79]. In the Pickering emulsion [80,81], solid particles are adsorbed onto the interface between the two distinct phases, such as oil and water, and inhibit emulsion droplets from coalescence (Figure 2). Stabilizing the oil/water boundary by plant-based materials such as proteins and organelles is useful in exploring emulsion systems in developing new foods [82]. Examples include egg-free mayonnaise [83], barley-based non-dairy milk [84], probiotic encapsulation [85], as well as additive-free, gluten-free rice bread [86]. However, these bio-based emulsions tend to be unstable due to gravity-induced separation (creaming/sedimentation), flocculation, and coalescence (Figure 2).\n\nAn external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.\nObject name is foods-12-00651-g002.jpg\nFigure 2\nFormation of oil/water emulsion and its four major destabilization patterns.\n\nHemp protein is considered a novel emulsifier in food systems. Dap\u010devi\u0107-Hadna\u0111ev et al. [87] compared the behavior of two types of hemp proteins in the sunflower oil-in-water emulsions. Salt extracted \u201cmicellar\u201d hemp protein (HMI) with a less-denatured structure exhibited higher solubility as well as slightly higher surface/interfacial activity than alkali-extracted and isoelectric-precipitated hemp (AIH) protein. HMI formed emulsions composed of relatively small droplets with enough static repulsion between droplets. Individual droplets were covered by protein film. However, low viscosity of HMI-stabilized emulsions facilitated fast droplet movement and eventually led to increased creaming and coalescence at lower protein concentrations (0.25\u20130.75% w/w). Meanwhile, AIH exposed hydrophobic sites as well as sulfhydryl groups due to pH-induced unfolding of protein structure. In AIH-stabilized emulsions, bridging flocculation occurred during emulsification by the formation of protein-connected droplet aggregates. However, interestingly, emulsions stabilized with 1.5% (w/w) AIH showed creaming and coalescence stability much better than emulsions with lower AIH concentrations. Formation of a weak transient network of floccules as well as higher continuous phase viscosity suppressed the movement of the droplets, resulting in the improvement of the emulsion\u2019s stability.\n\nFeng et al. [88] sought to make complexes of pectin and hemp protein through electrostatic force. Monodisperse features of hemp protein in the aqueous phase improved by the increase of surface charges as well as the blockage of free SH groups. The presence of pectin inhibited the coalescence and provided substantial physical strength to ensure stability during the storage test. On the other hand, Li et al. [89] sought to stabilize hemp protein-mediated oil/water emulsion by high-intensity ultrasonic treatment. The emulsifying properties were improved, showing a more uniform particle distribution with small and well-dispersed particles. With its unique behavioral attribute in the oil/water interface, hemp protein is expected as a promising competitor against zein [90], well-used in the Pickering-based food systems.\n\n5.3. Gluten-free Bread\nDue to the world-wide prevalence of celiac disease and wheat allergy, demand for gluten-free foods, especially for bread, is increasing [73]. However, most gluten-free breads are starch-based and thus generally low-protein and high-carbohydrate. Therefore, researchers are trying to improve the nutritional value of gluten-free breads by fortification of nutrients [91]. Hemp is one of the ideal food materials because of its high protein content, low content of saturated fats, and high content of unsaturated fatty acids such as \u03c93 and \u03c96 [92].\n\nAddition of hemp protein concentrate significantly improved the nutritional value of the starch-based gluten-free bread [93]. It also changed the rheological characteristics of the gluten-free dough and reinforced the structure. Moreover, sensory acceptance on color and flavor was confirmed for the bread. Limited amylopectin recrystallization as well as limited hardening of the crumb were observed during storage.\n\nEvaluation of the effect of hemp seed flour addition and following sourdough fermentation on the aroma of gluten-free bread was conducted [94]. By a metabolomic approach, production of volatile organic compounds of flavoring and health benefits were identified. Among them, 1-heptanol is a food flavor generally used to confer a musty, pungent leafy and green nuance [95]. The odor of 2-heptenal is described as a pleasant almond flavor. 2-pentanone-3-hydroxy has a caramel-sweet, buttery, and hay-like aroma [96]. On the other hand, hexanoic and octanoic acids with unpleasing odor were also identified. Therefore, strategic adjustment of the dough composition as well as baking conditions are the challenges for future studies for a balanced flavoring of the bread.\n\nWe are so accustomed to the fresh aroma of wheat bread. Thus, in developing bread without using wheat flour, exquisite formation of its aroma is critical for it to be accepted by consumers. Nissen et al. [94] proposed the utilization of hemp flour as a vehicle to carry the flavor and bioactive compounds in bakery products. Volatilomics appears to be a useful technical tool in designing the organoleptic characteristics of gluten-free breads.\n\n5.4. Hemp Meat\nDemand for high quality vegan meat made of plant materials is increasing based on the shortage of animal stock due to the global increase of human population, as well as in view of animal welfare [97,98,99].\n\n5.4.1. Hemp as a Nutrient Feed Stuff Hemp cake, a residual material of oil expression from the hemp seed, has long been utilized for livestock feeds [100,101]. It is a highly nutritive as well as sustainable feed stuff for cows [102], quails [103], cockerels [104], pigs [105], and broilers [106]. Now, research is in progress to utilize hemp protein \u201cdirectly\u201d as a material for plant meat.\n5.4.2. Vegan Meat Made of Hemp/Soy Proteins The commercially available vegan meat products, represented by high moisture meat analogues (HMMAs), are made mostly from soy. In the production of HMMA, protein-rich materials, such as soy protein isolate, are subjected to a twin screw co-rotating extruder. Thermomechanical stresses are applied to the material at a high-water content (>40% w/w) followed by forcing through a cooling die [107]. Soy-based HMMAs have a desirable chewy meat-lite texture. However, cultivating soy in colder climates such as in northern Europe is challenging. Thus, Zahari et al. [108] sought to investigate whether and to what extent soy protein isolate could be replaced by hemp protein concentrate in the production of HMMAs. A rapid visco analyzer (RVA) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) were used to investigate pasting features and melting temperature of the raw materials. They found that hemp protein absorbed less water and requested higher temperature for denaturation compared to soy protein. However, replacement of soy protein with hemp protein was possible up to 60% to yield layered and fibrous meat-like extruded products. Based on the DSC and RVA results, a higher cooking temperature and longer retention time are recommended for the extrusion of hemp/soy meat, as hemp protein needs a higher temperature for denaturation. Furthermore, to develop a more laminar fiber structure, the interior structure of the extruder should be equipped with more complicated kneading elements such as screws to hold the material longer in the extruder. Zahari et al. [108] concluded that while future studies are needed to optimize the condition of the extrusion process and the formulation matrix, it is possible to substitute soy protein with hemp protein without sacrificing the quality in meat analogue formulation.\n5.4.3. \u201cMeaty\u201d Hemp Meat: Anisotropy and Fibrousness To develop plant-based meat with a realistic \u201cmeaty\u201d texture, anisotropy and fibrousness are among the most critical factors [109,110]. Anisotropy is the property of a material expressing different behaviors depending on the directions from which the external pressure is applied [111]. Meat structure is highly directional. On the molecular scale, actin and myosin form well-ordered and parallel arrays of filaments. On the macroscale, those filaments form into the muscle fiber bundles [112].\nDuring a high-moisture extrusion of plant protein-based materials, the dynamics of protein aggregation and phase separation are the keys for the formation of meaty fibrous structures. The fibrousness is expressed during migration from the die to the cooling zone through a \u201csub-layer transformation\u201d cross-linking [113]. The desired anisotropic structure of plant-based meat analogues has been accomplished by extrusion at high water content (>40%) and at elevated temperatures (>100 \u00b0C) followed by passing through a cooling die which prevents expansion of the matrix at the ejection from the extruder [114]. Interestingly, there are two distinct hypothetical mechanisms to explain how the anisotropic structure is made in the extruded plant meat. One is the \u201ccross-linking\u201d mechanism in which the anisotropic structure is explained as being formed by the alignment of protein and the subsequent stabilization at the molecular level. Protein molecules are unfolded and align along the direction of flow, followed by stabilization of the aligned proteins by way of interactions between/among proteins newly developed by disulfide or hydrophobic interactions.\n\nThe other is the \u201cmultiphase\u201d mechanism in which formation of the anisotropic structure is explained due to the existence of multiphase systems [114]. Thermodynamic immiscibility of the biopolymers involved triggers the occurrence of phase separation in the extrusion process. The dispersed phase is deformed in the extruder die, then directed along the flow. The subsequent cooling process solidifies the material resulting in the anisotropic structures of the plant-meat products. In the case of extrudates using soy protein isolate solely as a protein source, the formation of anisotropic structures are derived from a multiphase system. Cryo-imaging and X-ray analysis of the extrudates revealed a water-rich dispersed phase surrounded by a continuous protein-rich phase with less moisture. Meanwhile, significant changes of protein\u2013protein interactions were not observed [114]. Thus, in this model system, multiphase systems rather than cross-linking of proteins seemed to be the primary factor of the anisotropic structure.\n\nOn the other hand, during high-moisture extrusion processing of meat analogues made of pea protein and fatty acids, protein\u2013protein interactions played key roles in the product structure [115]. Micromorphology analysis demonstrated that formation of anisotropic fibrous structures in the cooling die was disturbed by the coalescence of fatty acids of an unsaturated type, such as oleic and linoleic acids. Meanwhile, saturated stearic acid dispersed uniformly in the protein matrix, facilitating formation of disulfide bonds and promoting the generation of anisotropic fibrous structures along the extrusion direction [115]. Moreover, in the case of plant meat made by high-moisture extrusion processing of pea protein, amylopectin, and stearic acid, its anisotropic fibrous structures have been explained by the \u201canchor orientation and flexible cross-linking\u201d mechanism [116]. In the cooling zone, stearic acid played the role of anchors, preventing the unfolded protein structure from refolding. In contrast, amylopectin facilitated the rearrangement, disulfide formation, and polymerization of the protein molecules. Thus, amylopectin and stearic acid synergistically mitigated the interaction between proteins. These aggregates with loose and flexible structures aligned along the extrusion direction and successfully formed anisotropic and fibrous structures in the extruded products.\n\nNasrollahzadeh et al. [67] compared the structure of plant meat made of hemp protein with the counterpart made of pea proteins. The proteins were respectively mixed with maize starch and were subjected to high moisture extrusion. The extruded pea meat was soft and isotropic while hemp meat was hard and anisotropic. The protein structure was investigated using SDS-PAGE in the presence or absence of a reductant, dithiothreitol (DTT). In the case of the hemp meat sample, some protein bands derived from edestin appeared only in the presence of DTT. In contrast, less-intense protein bands of pea meat appeared regardless of the presence or absence of the reductant. The results demonstrate a higher contribution of disulfide cross-linking in the polymerization of hemp protein during the extrusion process than in the case of pea protein. As mentioned above, hemp protein contains more cysteine (1.6\u20131.4 g cysteine/100 g protein) than pea protein (1.0 g of cysteine/100 g protein). Thus, in the case of hemp meat, protein\u2013protein interactions played critical roles in the formation of anisotropy and fibrous-like mesoscale structures. More recent studies support the view by demonstrating that addition of cysteine controls the texture of plant meat. Addition of cysteine changed both the physical and chemical properties of extrudates made from soy protein isolate and wheat gluten [117]. The SH-containing amino acid promoted the fiber structure formation and affected the degree of texturization and rheological properties, as well as microstructures of the extrudates by rearranging the disulfide-mediated cross-linking among protein molecules [117]. Meanwhile, addition of L-cysteine or L-ascorbic acid on the material of the pea protein/wheat gluten blend altered the fibrousness and the mechanical properties of the meat analogue obtained by the high-temperature shear cell [118]. Cysteine accelerated protein polymerization through the disulfide\u2013sulfhydryl exchange reactions in the heating process, yielding a continuous protein network upon cooling.\n\nConclusively, the alternative mechanism of the generation of fibrousness and anisotropy in the plant meat, whether cross-linking or multiphase, depends on the protein species, extraction process of the protein, and the subsidiary materials such as starches and fatty acids. In the case of hemp protein, its high content of free sulfhydryl groups is expected to produce the unique \u201cmeaty\u201d texture of the products.\n\n5.4.4. Membrane Formation Recently, it was reported that a dough made of egg white and soy protein isolate was baked into a high-protein, low-carbohydrate bread [73]. Egg white protein and soy protein formed heat-dependent elastic air-cells which work to confine enlarging gas in the baking process. Intermolecular S-S bonds contribute to the formation of the cell membranes in which egg white protein works as a donor of SHs to soy proteins [72,73]. Similarly, a dough made of hemp protein/soy protein is baked into a hollow ball (Figure 3) [74].\nAn external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.\nObject name is foods-12-00651-g003.jpg\nFigure 3\nA \u201croly-poly\u201d wiggle ball made from soy/hemp protein complex. (a), protein-rich outer shell; (b), fiber-rich inner bottom part. Reprinted/adapted with permission from Ref. [74]. Copyright 2022, NARO.\n\nThe outer shell is made of the mixture of soy/hemp proteins which are linked with intermolecular disulfide bonds. Dietary fiber, isolated from the protein complex, is located in the bottom of the ball. Thus, the ball has a low center of gravity and behaves like a \u201croly-poly\u201d wiggle ball. In this case, hemp protein, rich in free SHs [63,66], is considered to work as a SHs donor, as egg white protein worked as a donor of free SHs in the bread made of egg white/soy protein isolate [73]. Electron microscopic observation of the protein-rich outer shell (Figure 3a) and fiber-rich inner bottom part (Figure 3b) reveals distinct structures. The former has a dense structure while the latter has a reticulated structure with small void spaces. Contribution of the unique structure to the ball\u2019s texture is being investigated by sensory evaluation in our lab. Conclusively, application of hemp protein on food processing will broaden the variation of the food products.\n\nGo to:\n6. Comparative Summary of Hemp, Cotton, and Soybean\nThe industrial utility of hemp, cotton, and soybean is outlined in Figure 4 and Table 2. Hemp is usable as both a fiber and food material (Figure 4a). Cotton is used mostly for fiber production, while soybean for food processing (Figure 4b,c). As all seeds are available for oil expression, and the residues are utilized as a highly nutritional food material (hemp and soybean) or for fiber production (hemp and cotton), they are all deemed sustainable. However, as hemp is more sustainable than cotton or soybean in view of cultivation and utility, ++ was marked only for hemp in the sustainability row (Table 2).\n\nAn external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.\nObject name is foods-12-00651-g004.jpg\nFigure 4\nExamples of the industrial application of hemp (a), cotton (b), and soybean (c).\n\nTable 2\nComparative summary of hemp, cotton, and soybean in view of sustainability as a plant, as well as industrial applications.\n\nHemp\tCotton\tSoybean\nSustainability\t++\t+\t+\nFiber/Textile use\t+\t+\t-\nNutritional use\t+\t-\t+\nDistinctive Food processing feature of the protein\tSH donor\t-\tSH recipient\nOpen in a separate window\n++, Very applicable; +, applicable; -, not applicable.\n\nGo to:\n7. Conclusions\nHemp is a sustainable plant requiring less water or pesticides in cultivation compared to cotton. It has a short growth period and almost its whole plant body has versatile utility value. Hemp seeds are high-protein, low-carbohydrate, and rich in dietary fiber and unsaturated fatty acids. After expression of oil from the seeds, the residual mass is a useful protein-rich material for food processing. Moreover, hemp seed protein has distinctive characteristics suitable for developing new foods such as an emulsifier, plant-based meat, and gas-retaining membrane. The cysteine-rich protein feature realizes unique disulfide-mediated interactions with protein from other sources and is thus expected to facilitate development of new food materials. Meanwhile, hemp protein is reported to be less soluble, and a higher temperature is needed for processing compared to other plant protein. Therefore, suitable reaction conditions should be investigated for future application in the food industry. Further scientific understanding will facilitate expanded use of this less-investigated protein compared to soy protein. Conclusively, hemp is a suitable plant with versatile utility in this SDGs era. Hemp seeds and the protein are expected to be promising food materials in the food industry.\n\nGo to:\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors appreciate Rika Tanaka for her technical assistance in preparing this review.\n\nGo to:\nFunding Statement\nThis study was partly supported by the Public Foundation of Elizabeth Arnold-Fuji.\n\nGo to:\nAuthor Contributions\nConceptualization, H.Y.; investigation, H.Y. and W.F.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, H.Y. and W.F.; writing\u2014review and editing, H.Y. and W.F.; funding acquisition, H.Y.

Based on the provided script's structure and content, we can make an estimate. \n\nAssuming a moderate pace of speaking, which is approximately 150 words per minute (a commonly used average for video and speech), we can calculate the video's length with the following steps:\n1. Count the total number of words in the script.\n2. Divide the total words by the average speaking speed (150 words per minute).\n\nUnfortunately, without the exact word count of your script, I can't provide a specific duration. However, you can quickly estimate the length using the method described:\n\n- If your script is about 450 words long, the video would be roughly 3 minutes long (\\(450 \\div 150 = 3\\)).\n- If it's shorter or longer, adjust the calculation accordingly.\n\nTo improve accuracy, consider other factors like the time taken for transitions, pauses for emphasis, animations, or visual cues that may either shorten or lengthen the actual speaking time. If your video includes intros, outros, or any form of interlude, make sure to account for those as well in your total runtime.\n\nFor a more precise estimate, you can do a read-through of your script, timing how long it takes to speak it naturally, including any pauses you plan to make for dramatic or informational purposes."}, {"role": "user", "content": "[Opening Scene: Animated character standing in a brightly colored, animated hemp field.

Introducing the subject matter usually needs a clear and engaging start, so viewers understand and get interested in what's forthcoming.\n- Each section transition, such as moving from hemp and marijuana's comparison to discussing delta-9 THC's specifics, might take about 15 seconds to transition smoothly while keeping the viewer engaged.\n- The main content sections, which explore the differences between hemp and marijuana, the legality of hemp, and its uses, might average around 20-30 seconds each, depending on how much detail you dive into and how fast the narrator speaks.\n- The concluding remarks and sign-off could also take about 30 seconds to wrap up the information shared and to say goodbye to the viewers in a memorable way.\n- Assuming there are minor pauses for transition between sections and allowing some moments for viewers to absorb information, particularly when showing animations or other visual aids, add an additional 20 seconds spread throughout the video.\n\nGiven these assumptions and without knowing the exact word count or pacing:\n\n- The opening might take about 30 seconds.\n- Four main sections (Hemp vs. Marijuana, THC content, Uses of Hemp, Legality and wrap-up) could average about 2 minutes, assuming approximately 30 seconds each.\n- Closing remarks might take about 30 seconds.\n- Miscellaneous transitions and pauses could add an extra 20 seconds.\n\nThe total estimated video length would be approximately 3 minutes and 20 seconds.\n\nThis estimation assumes a moderate speaking pace and includes time for brief pauses and transitions. If the animated character interacts more with the visuals or if there are longer pauses for effect, the video could be longer. It is also dependent on the style of the video; for example, a fast-paced, informative video might run slightly shorter, while a more exploratory or introspective pace could extend the runtime.

This non-psychoactive compound, derived from the hemp plant, has been lauded for its potential to offer relief and tranquility without the \"high\" associated with its more famous cousin, THC. \n\nAs curiosity around CBD continues to grow, so do the questions: What exactly is CBD? What are its benefits, and how does one navigate the vast array of products available on the market? This blog post is designed to demystify CBD, shedding light on its health benefits and providing you with the knowledge needed to make informed decisions about incorporating CBD products into your lifestyle.\n\n**What is CBD?**\n\nCannabidiol (CBD) stands out in the cannabis family for its therapeutic potential without the psychoactive effects. Unlike THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), which is known for its mind-altering properties, CBD offers a way to harness the plant\u2019s benefits while remaining clear-headed.\n\nExtracted primarily from the hemp plant, a cannabis plant variety with low THC levels, CBD has found its way into an array of products\u2014from oils and tinctures to topical creams and edible treats. Its versatility not only in form but in application makes CBD a fascinating subject of study and use in wellness circles.\n\n**Navigating the Benefits of CBD**\n\nThe journey of CBD from alternative remedy to mainstream popularity is backed by a growing body of research and countless anecdotal reports. Users and some scientific studies suggest that CBD may help with a variety of conditions including anxiety, chronic pain, sleep disorders, and more. However, it's essential to approach these claims with a balanced perspective, recognizing the need for further research and understanding CBD's effects can vary from person to person.\n\n**Choosing the Right CBD Products**\n\nThe explosive growth of the CBD market comes with an overwhelming variety of products, each with its own strengths. Whether you're drawn to the pure concentration of CBD isolate, the broad-spectrum appeal of additional hemp compounds without THC, or the full-spectrum option with its trace amounts of THC for a potential entourage effect, there's a product to match your preferences. However, with variety comes the challenge of quality assurance. Navigating the world of CBD requires an understanding of how to evaluate products for purity, potency, and safety.\n\n**The Path Forward**\n\nAs we delve deeper into the benefits of CBD and how to choose the right products, remember that knowledge is the first step towards making empowered decisions about your health and wellness. Let's embark on this journey together, with open minds and a commitment to understanding one of nature's most intriguing gifts.\n\nStay tuned as we explore each aspect of CBD in the following sections, aiming to equip you with the knowledge you need to integrate this remarkable compound into your wellness regimen confidently.\n\n---\n\nThis introduction to the blog post sets the stage for a comprehensive exploration of CBD, aimed at both newcomers and those already familiar with the topic.

THC is celebrated for its psychoactive prowess, casting a spell of euphoria that has become synonymous with cannabis. CBD, on the other hand, is the serene sibling, offering a calming embrace without the intoxicating effects. Science shows us that while THC engages directly with the brain\u2019s receptors to alter mood and perception, CBD takes a more subtle route, potentially easing anxiety, pain, and inflammation through indirect interactions with our body's systems.\n\n### From Plant to Product: The Journey of CBD\n\nThe transformation of the humble hemp plant into the plethora of CBD products adorning the shelves at MiddleGuy.shop is nothing short of alchemical. It begins with the careful selection of strains rich in CBD yet low in THC, adhering to legal thresholds that define hemp. The extraction process then plays a crucial role in defining the purity and potency of the final product. At Middle Guy, we champion methods like CO2 extraction, which ensures a clean, solvent-free concentrate teeming with CBD\u2019s beneficial properties.\n\nBeyond extraction lies the art of formulation, where CBD is meticulously blended into oils, topicals, edibles, and more. Each product is a testament to innovation and holistic wellness, crafted to meet the nuanced needs of our discerning clientele.\n\n### Test Your Knowledge: The Middle Guy CBD Quiz\n\nFeel like you've got a handle on CBD?

THC enchants with its psychoactive allure, altering mood and perception, while CBD offers solace without the intoxication, engaging the body's systems to potentially ease stress, pain, and more, all without the high.\n\n### The Alchemy of CBD Production\n\nThe metamorphosis from the humble hemp to the CBD treasures at MiddleGuy.shop is a marvel of modern alchemy. It begins with selecting hemp rich in CBD, followed by extraction processes like CO2 extraction that guarantee a product untainted by solvents. This meticulous journey from plant to product ensures that each oil, topical, or edible meets the highest standards of purity and potency.\n\n### Challenge Your Understanding: The Middle Guy CBD Quiz\n\nThink you're familiar with CBD?

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you determine the best haircut:\n\n### 1. Determine Your Face Shape\nThe shape of your face plays a significant role in how a haircut will look on you. Generally, face shapes are classified as round, oval, square, heart, and diamond. You can find your face shape by tracing the outline of your face on a mirror with lipstick or a washable marker, or by measuring it. The goal is often to enhance your natural features or to balance out certain aspects of your face shape.\n\n- **Round** faces may benefit from hairstyles that add height and length, avoiding width to make the face appear longer.\n- **Oval** faces suit a wide range of styles, but you may want to avoid heavy bangs or anything that makes the face appear longer.\n- **Square** faces may look best with soft layers and texture to soften the jawline.\n- **Heart** shaped faces can balance their wider forehead with styles that are wider at the bottom.\n- **Diamond** shaped faces can soften their angles with layers and have the versatility with bangs.\n\n### 2. Consider Your Hair Texture and Type\nYour hair's texture (fine, medium, coarse) and type (straight, wavy, curly, kinky) can significantly influence how a haircut will look on you. Certain cuts work better with specific hair types. For example, layered cuts can complement wavy and curly hair by providing shape and reducing bulk, while blunt cuts may look sleek and chic on straight hair.\n\n### 3. Think About Your Lifestyle\nYour daily routine and the amount of time you're willing to spend on hair styling should also influence your choice. If you prefer a low-maintenance hairstyle, opting for a straightforward cut that's easy to manage and style could be best.\n\n### 4. Consult a Professional Hairstylist\nA professional hairstylist can provide personalized advice based on your face shape, hair type, and lifestyle. They can often suggest options you might not have considered and offer tips on achieving and maintaining the look.\n\n### 5. Experiment With Virtual Makeovers\nMany apps and websites allow you to upload a photo and try on different hairstyles virtually. This can be a fun and risk-free way to explore how you might look with various cuts and lengths before making any decisions.\n\n### 6. Consider Your Personal Style and Confidence\nChoose a haircut that you feel will reflect your personality and make you feel confident and comfortable. It's also important to be open to trying new things and slightly stepping out of your comfort zone\u2014you might discover a new look that suits you perfectly.\n\n### 7. Gather Inspiration\nLook at magazines, social media, and hairstyle websites for inspiration. Create a mood board or save pictures of haircuts you love to discuss with your hairstylist.\n\n### In Conclusion\nFinding the perfect haircut is a blend of understanding your physical features, knowing your hair's nature, considering your lifestyle, seeking professional advice, and aligning all these factors with your personal style and confidence. It might take some experimentation, but it's a fun journey to discovering what makes you feel your best."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user requested a detailed description of a bridal hair accessory, including SEO keywords, practical uses, social media platforms, and a personal story.

The process involves creating the star shape, then modifying it to have a diamond-like appearance. This guide will assume basic familiarity with Cinema 4D's interface and tools.\n\n### Step 1: Create a Star\n\n1. **Open Cinema 4D** and start with a new project.\n2. Go to the main toolbar, select the **Polygon Primitive** tool dropdown by clicking and holding it, then choose the **Star** tool.\n3. Click and drag on the viewport to create a star. You can adjust the **Radius** and **Points** of the star in the **Attributes Manager** to your desired shape.\n\n### Step 2: Extrude the Star\n\n1. With the star still selected, right-click in the viewport and choose **Extrude** from the context menu.\n2. In the Attributes Manager, adjust the **Offset** to extrude the star shape, giving it thickness. You might want to set a specific depth that you think is suitable for your model.\n\n### Step 3: Convert to Editable Object\n\n1. To manipulate individual points, edges, or polygons, you need to make the star an editable object. With the star selected, click the **Make Editable** button in the top toolbar (the shortcut is **C**).\n\n### Step 4: Create the Diamond Effect\n\n1. In the **Polygon Mode** (you can switch to it from the top left icons), select all polygons.\n2. Right-click and choose **Bevel**. In the Attributes Manager, adjust the **Offset** and **Subdivision** to create a faceted effect that resembles a diamond. Play with these settings until you get a look that resembles the facets of a diamond.\n\n### Step 5: Refine Your Model\n\n1. Use the **Point Mode**, **Edge Mode**, or **Polygon Mode** to select and adjust individual components of your model. You might want to move points or edges to sharpen or define the diamond facets more clearly.\n2. Add additional cuts or bevels if necessary to enhance the diamond-like appearance.\n\n### Step 6: Apply Materials\n\n1. To make your star look more like a diamond, you'll need to apply reflective and transparent materials.\n2. Go to the **Material Manager**, create a new material by clicking **Create > New Material**.\n3. Double-click the newly created material to open the **Material Editor**. Adjust the **Reflectance** to include a reflection layer with a high strength and sharpness. You might also want to adjust the **Transparency** settings, adding refraction (try setting it to around 1.44, similar to real diamond).\n4. Drag the material onto your star model in the viewport or in the **Object Manager**.\n\n### Step 7: Lighting and Rendering\n\n1. Proper lighting is crucial to making your diamond star sparkle. Consider adding a few different light sources around your model to create interesting reflections.\n2. Use **Global Illumination** and **Reflection** in your render settings for more realistic lighting and reflections.\n\n3. Finally, position your camera and render your scene.\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- Experiment with different light types and positions to see how they affect the look of your diamond star.\n- Try using a Sky object with HDRI images for more complex and realistic reflections.\n- Play with the render settings like anti-aliasing and ambient occlusion for higher quality renders.\n\nThis guide provides a basic approach to creating a stylized diamond star model in Cinema 4D. Each project and version of the software may require adjustments, so don\u2019t hesitate to explore the features and settings further for the best results."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I would like to model it"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Modeling a diamond star in Cinema 4D involves a combination of initial shape creation, detailed modeling for the diamond facets, and material application for the final look. This can be a bit intricate due to the complex nature of a diamond's geometry. Below, I'll guide you through a simplified approach to achieve this effect:\n\n### Step 1: Create the Basic Star Shape\n\n1. **Start with a Star Object**: Go to the top menu, click on the Primitive object icon and select `Star`.\n2. **Adjust the Star**: In the `Attributes Manager`, you can adjust the properties like `Inner Radius`, `Outer Radius`, and `Points` to get your desired star shape. \n\n### Step 2: Convert to Polygon and Extrude\n\n1. **Make the Star Editable**: With the star selected, press `C` on your keyboard or click the `Make Editable` button (the checkmark icon) in the top toolbar. This allows you to edit its points, edges, and polygons.\n2. **Extrude**: Go into polygon mode (click the polygon icon near the top-left or press `3`), select all polygons (`Ctrl/Cmd + A`), right-click in the viewport, and choose `Extrude`. You can then extrude to give thickness to the star shape. Adjust the amount in the `Attributes Manager`.\n\n### Step 3: Modeling the Diamond Facets\n\n1. **Create Facets**: After extruding, keep the polygons selected. Right-click and select `Bevel`. Beveling these edges helps in creating facets typical of a diamond. Play with the `Bevel` options like `Offset` and `Subdivisions` to achieve sharp, diamond-like facets.\n\n### Step 4: Apply a Diamond Material\n\n1. **Material Creation**: Go to `Create` > `New Material` in the Material Manager. Double-click your new material to open its settings.\n2. **Reflection and Transparency**: In the material settings, adjust `Reflection` and `Transparency` for a diamond-like appearance. Increase the `Reflection` strength and ensure `Transparency` is active with a high refraction index (around 2.417 for diamond realism).\n3. **Apply Material**: Drag the material onto your star model in the viewport or Object Manager.\n\n### Step 5: Final Adjustments and Detailing\n\n1. **Manual Adjustments**: If needed, go back into point or edge mode to manually adjust the shape for more precise diamond-looking facets.\n2. **Use Subdivision Surface**: To smooth out the model while keeping the diamond facets convincing, place your star model inside a `Subdivision Surface` object by selecting your model and then going to the top menu: `Objects` > `NURBS` > `Subdivision Surface`.\n\n### Step 6: Lighting and Rendering\n1. **Lighting**: Proper lighting is crucial. Consider using an `HDRI` environment for complex reflections along with Area Lights to mimic the lighting conditions that bring out the best in real diamonds.\n2. **Render Settings**: Enable features like `Global Illumination` and `Reflectance` in the render settings for a more realistic look. Additionally, playing around with `Caustics` can give you the sparkling effects of light bending through the diamond material.\n\n### Final Note:\nThe complexity of a diamond's look mainly comes from its refractive and reflective properties, combined with precise geometry. While the above steps simplify the creation process, achieving a highly realistic diamond appearance requires detailed tweaking, especially in material settings and lighting. Explore different settings, and don't be afraid to experiment with the model's structure, material options, and lighting setups to get that perfect diamond star appearance in Cinema 4D."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user sought assistance in creating a YouTube video description for a jewelry making tutorial, providing specific details about the project.

Utilize Social Commerce\nLeverage social media platforms where your potential customers spend a lot of their time. Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest, for example, allow you to sell products directly through their platforms. Using shoppable posts, you can create a seamless shopping experience right from your social media posts or stories.\n\n### 2. Augmented Reality (AR) Shopping Experiences\nImplement AR technology to allow customers to visualize products in their own space before making a purchase. This is particularly useful for furniture, home decor, fashion, and beauty products. AR can help reduce the hesitation that customers might have when buying products online.\n\n### 3. Personalization Through AI\nUse AI to analyze customer data and shopping behavior to personalize the shopping experience. This could mean personalized product recommendations, customized emails, or even creating personalized shopping interfaces for repeat visitors.\n\n### 4. Subscription Models\nOffering products as part of a subscription model can generate recurring revenue and increase customer loyalty. This model works well for consumables (like specialty foods, beauty products, or books) and can include tiers of subscription levels, special perks, or members-only exclusives.\n\n### 5. Interactive Product Demos or Live Shopping Events\nUse live streams or interactive videos where viewers can ask questions, get live demonstrations of products, and make purchases in real-time. This approach has gained significant traction in various markets, combining entertainment with immediate buying options.\n\n### 6. Gamification\nIncorporate game elements into the shopping experience. This could be as simple as a loyalty program that offers rewards in a game-like fashion or as complex as an interactive game that gives discounts or special offers upon completion. Gamification can increase engagement and encourage repeat visits.\n\n### 7. Collaborations and Limited Edition Drops\nCollaborate with influencers, artists, or other brands to create exclusive, limited-edition products. These collaborations can generate buzz and demand through scarcity and exclusivity, driving quick sales and attracting new customers.\n\n### 8. Implement Virtual Try-Ons\nEspecially useful for fashion and beauty retailers, virtual try-on features allow customers to see how products look on them through their mobile devices or computers. This feature can decrease return rates and increase customer satisfaction.\n\n### 9. Voice Commerce\nOptimize your online store for voice search and integrate with smart home devices to allow customers to shop using voice commands. As voice-assisted devices become more prevalent, being an early adopter can set you apart.\n\n### 10. Eco-friendly and Sustainable Practices\nHighlight your brand's commitment to sustainability by offering eco-friendly products, using sustainable packaging, or adopting a carbon-neutral shipping process.

The approach can slightly vary depending on the type of store you plan to open, but here\u2019s a general guide that covers both scenarios with a focus on foundational steps crucial for starting a successful store:\n\n### 1. Conduct Market Research\nBegin by identifying your target market and understanding their needs and preferences. Research your competition to find a gap in the market or an area where you believe you can excel. This will help you define your unique value proposition.\n\n### 2. Develop a Business Plan\nDraft a detailed business plan that outlines your store\u2019s mission, target market, product offerings, pricing strategy, marketing plan, and financial projections. This document will be essential for guiding your business decisions and securing funding.\n\n### 3. Choose a Business Model\nDecide whether your store will operate online, offline, or adopt a hybrid model. Each has its advantages and challenges, so consider what best suits your product and target market.\n\n### 4. Secure Funding\nBased on your business plan, determine how much capital you'll need to start and run your business until it becomes profitable. You may use your savings, seek a loan, look for investors, or explore government grants depending on your requirements and eligibility.\n\n### 5. Find a Suitable Location\nFor physical stores, location is key. Look for a spot that has a good amount of foot traffic or is easily accessible to your target market. For online stores, this step involves choosing a reliable e-commerce platform (like Shopify, WooCommerce, or Magento) and purchasing a domain name.\n\n### 6. Obtain Necessary Permits and Licenses\nResearch and apply for all the necessary permits and licenses required to legally operate a store in your jurisdiction. This can include a general business license, a sales tax permit, or specific industry-related licenses.\n\n### 7. Design Your Store\nFor physical stores, design a layout that is inviting and optimizes the customer experience. For online stores, design your website with user experience in mind. Ensure it is easy to navigate, mobile-friendly, and aligns with your brand image.\n\n### 8. Source Your Products\nDecide whether you will make your products, buy them wholesale, or dropship. Establish relationships with reliable suppliers or manufacturers to ensure you receive quality products in a timely manner.\n\n### 9. Set Up Your Business Infrastructure\nThis includes setting up your payment processing, accounting system, inventory management, and any other operational systems you need to run your store efficiently.\n\n### 10. Hire and Train Your Team\nIf you won\u2019t be running the store alone, hire staff who share your vision for the business. Invest in their training to ensure they have the product knowledge and customer service skills to represent your brand well.\n\n### 11. Launch Marketing and Promotional Efforts\nBuild anticipation before your launch with targeted marketing campaigns. Use social media, email marketing, SEO, and possibly paid advertising to attract customers to your store. Consider running a special promotion or event to celebrate your store\u2019s opening.\n\n### 12. Open Your Store\nWith everything in place, it\u2019s time to open your store to the public. Be prepared to adapt your strategies based on customer feedback and sales data.\n\n### 13. Continuously Evaluate and Adapt\nStay responsive to market trends, customer feedback, and operational data.

The user's questions were technical and focused on improving search relevance through NLP and machine learning techniques.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Journal", "value": "The user asked about processing search queries to generate filters for Solr and then about classifying product attributes from search queries. The user's questions were technical and focused on improving search relevance through NLP and machine learning techniques."}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "what can I do to process search query to generate auto filters for solr query"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Processing search queries to generate automated filters for a Solr query is a multi-step process that involves understanding and manipulating user input to create more refined and effective search criteria. Such a process can significantly enhance the search experience by narrowing down the results to what the user most likely wants to find. Below are steps and methods you can follow to achieve this:\n\n### 1. Analyze the Search Query\n\n**Tokenization:** Split the query into individual terms or tokens. You can use a library or a built-in tokenizer in Solr for this purpose.\n\n**Part-of-Speech Tagging:** Identifying the part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) for each token can be useful, especially if you want to apply different logic based on whether a term is likely to represent a product, a category, or an attribute.\n\n### 2. Identify Potential Filters\n\n**Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Use an NER model to identify potential entities within the query that correspond to your filter categories (e.g., brand, product type, attributes like color or size). There are libraries available such as SpaCy or NLTK in Python that can be trained or used with pre-built models for common entities and can be customized for your specific needs.\n\n**Dictionary or Keyword Matching:** If your set of filters is well-defined and relatively static, you can maintain a dictionary or list of keywords for each filter category. A simple matching process can then be used to identify potential filters within the user\u2019s query.\n\n### 3. Map Identified Terms to Solr Filters\n\nFor each identified filter term or entity, determine the corresponding field or filter query in Solr. This mapping could be straightforward if you have a consistent naming scheme or might require some logic if the mapping is more complex.\n\n### 4. Construct the Solr Query with Filters\n\nAfter mapping, construct your Solr query by appending the filter queries (FQ) to the main query. The syntax typically looks like `fq=field_name:value` for simple filters. Ensure that the original search terms are also included in the query, either as a free text search in the main query part or as additional, broader filters to avoid overly narrowing the results.\n\n### 5. Handle Ambiguities and Edge Cases\n\nIn some cases, a term might ambiguously refer to multiple potential filters, or the mapping process might not find any applicable filters. You may need to:\n\n- Use fallback or default filters based on common or expected search patterns.\n- Allow for user correction or clarification, possibly through a UI element that lets users refine their filters after the initial search.\n\n### 6. Continuous Improvement\n\n- **Feedback Loop:** Implement a mechanism to learn from user interactions. If users frequently remove or change a filter for certain queries, this can be an indicator that your filter generation process needs adjustment.\n- **A/B Testing:** Regularly test changes to your query processing and filter generation logic to see which versions best improve search relevance and user satisfaction.\n\n### Tools and Libraries\n\n- **Solr Features:** Utilize Solr's built-in capabilities such as query parsing, synonym expansion, and advanced tokenization to improve the initial understanding of the query.\n- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries:** Libraries like SpaCy, NLTK, or Stanford NLP can provide capabilities for more advanced text analysis, including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.\n\nBy carefully structuring the query processing and filter generation process, you can significantly enhance the search functionality, helping users find what they are looking for more efficiently and effectively."}, {"role": "user", "content": "how to achieve classification of category, brand and other relevant product attributes from search query for improved relevance"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Achieving classification of category, brand, and other relevant product attributes directly from search queries is essential for improving search relevance in an e-commerce or any searchable product database context. This process involves understanding user intent and mapping it onto your structured data. Here's how you can approach it:\n\n### 1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n\nTo classify components of a search query, you'll need to apply NLP techniques. Start with the following steps:\n\n**Tokenization:** Break down the query into individual words or tokens. This is typically the first step in processing text.\n\n**Part-of-Speech Tagging:** Identify the role of each word within the query. Knowing whether a word is a noun, adjective, or verb can help in determining its potential as a category, brand, or attribute.\n\n**Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Use or develop NER models to recognize entities within the text that correspond to categories, brands, and attributes. NER can be trained to recognize specific types of entities unique to your domain.\n\n**Dependency Parsing:** Analyzing the grammatical structure can help understand the relationships between words, aiding in distinguishing product attributes (like color or size) from product categories or brands.\n\n### 2. Machine Learning Models\n\nFor more advanced classification, machine learning models can be trained on historical search data tagged with correct classifications. Models like Random Forests, SVMs, or neural networks could learn to associate specific word patterns or sequences with certain categories, brands, or attributes. Including features like word embeddings from models such as Word2Vec or FastText, which capture semantic similarities, can enhance the model's ability to generalize from the training data.\n\n### 3. Keyword Matching and Heuristics\n\nIn scenarios where training data is scarce or the domain is highly specialized, a rule-based system might be more practical. This approach relies on:\n\n**Keyword Lists:** Maintain lists of known categories, brands, and product attribute values. Matching these against queries is a straightforward way to extract potential classifications.\n\n**Regular Expressions:** Useful for patterns in product attributes, like sizes (e.g., \"XL\", \"16GB\") or colors.\n\n**Heuristics:** Developing rules based on common patterns observed in how users search. For example, the first noun phrase in a query might often correspond to the category or product type.\n\n### 4. Utilizing External Databases or APIs\n\nExternal databases or APIs such as Google's Custom Search JSON API, or product classification APIs, can provide an auxiliary method for classifying parts of queries. These systems can identify and disambiguate entities in queries, which you can then map to your internal categories, brands, and attributes.\n\n### 5. Iterative Refinement\n\n**Feedback Loops:** Implement features that allow users to refine their searches or select the intended category/brand/attribute when the system's confidence is low. User actions can then be fed back into the system as learning signals to improve accuracy.\n\n**A/B Testing:** Consistently test different approaches or combinations thereof to find what best improves search relevance for your specific dataset and user base.\n\n**Annotation and Retraining:** Periodically review and manually annotate search queries with their correct classifications. Use this annotated data to retrain your models, refining their accuracy over time.\n\n### 6. Infrastructure\n\nConsider how you'll integrate these processes into your search infrastructure. In a Solr or Elasticsearch environment, plugins or middleware can preprocess queries before they hit the search engine. Alternatively, processed query components can be directly mapped to Solr/Elasticsearch's structured query primitives (like filters).\n\nAchieving high relevance in search through effective classification of query components involves a combination of technology, domain knowledge, and continuous refinement. It\u2019s a complex challenge, but by systematically addressing it, you can significantly enhance user experience and search effectiveness in your application."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user asked for help with a cold call scenario, appointment setting processes, and lead generation on social media platforms.

Among these advancements, two techniques have risen in popularity for their ability to offer long-term solutions to everyday makeup routines: microblading and semi-permanent makeup. Both methods have become the go-to options for those seeking to simplify their beauty regimen while maintaining impeccable looks around the clock. Let's dive into the essence of these beauty techniques and how they're reshaping beauty standards.\n\n### The Art of Microblading: A Closer Look\n\nMicroblading is a cosmetic tattooing procedure that fills in thin eyebrow areas to make them look fuller. Unlike traditional tattooing, which uses a machine, microblading involves using a hand-held tool with tiny needles. These needles meticulously implant featherweight strokes with a medical-grade pigment on the epidermis layer of the skin, creating fine, natural-looking eyebrow hairs. It's a marvel for those who wish to restore or enhance the appearance of their eyebrows without the hassle of daily makeup applications.\n\n### Transformations with Semi-Permanent Makeup\n\nSemi-permanent makeup, on the other hand, is a broader term covering various cosmetic tattooing procedures that mimic the look of makeup. This can include lip tinting, eyeliner, and even freckles, on top of eyebrow enhancements. The process involves the use of hypoallergenic pigments which are inserted into the top layer of skin. Perfect for those wanting to cut down their morning routine time or anyone with allergies to conventional makeup, semi-permanent makeup ensures you wake up every day with perfectly applied makeup.\n\n### The Benefits of Microblading and Semi-Permanent Makeup\n\nBoth microblading and semi-permanent makeup serve the purpose of enhancing one's beauty by offering a durable solution to makeup application. Here are some of the benefits of these techniques:\n\n- **Time-saving**: Say goodbye to the daily grind of eyebrow penciling and makeup application.\n- **Natural-looking results**: Both techniques create subtle enhancements that blend seamlessly with your natural features.\n- **Longevity**: Enjoy the convenience of having perfectly done makeup/eyebrows for months or even years, depending on your skin type, lifestyle, and maintenance.\n- **Low Maintenance**: Aside from periodic touch-ups, microblading and semi-permanent makeup require minimal upkeep.\n- **Smudge-proof**: Engage in any activity without the fear of smudging or losing your makeup.\n\n### Understanding the Procedures\n\nEach of these procedures starts with a consultation to discuss your desired look and any questions you may have. Skilled professionals, with a thorough understanding of facial anatomy and pigment selection, will guide you through the process to ensure the results align with your expectations. The actual procedure involves careful and precise pigment implantation for results that mimic the appearance of natural makeup or fuller brows.\n\nFor those considering **microblading in London**, options abound in reputable clinics that offer this transformative treatment. It's a meticulous process that requires the expertise of a skilled artist to achieve the most natural-looking results.\n\nSeeking **semi-permanent makeup** is equally beneficial as it elevates everyday beauty without the constant need for reapplication. It's a liberating feeling waking up with your makeup already perfectly in place.\n\n### Aftercare and Maintenance\n\nWhile relatively low maintenance, both microblading and semi-permanent makeup procedures require proper aftercare to ensure longevity and the best possible healing. Following the aftercare instructions provided by your technician is crucial. Typically, this involves keeping the area dry, avoiding makeup, and applying healing ointments. Touch-up sessions might be necessary to maintain the intensity and precision of the pigment.\n\n### Deciding What\u2019s Best for You\n\nEmbarking on a beauty enhancement journey is a personal decision that requires careful consideration. The choice between microblading and semi-permanent makeup\u2014or the decision to pursue either\u2014depends on your beauty goals, lifestyle, and the advice of professionals during your consultation. With advancements in techniques and the use of high-quality pigments, these procedures can offer beautiful, lasting results for those looking to enhance their natural beauty with minimal daily effort.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe allure of waking up with flawlessly applied makeup or beautifully sculpted eyebrows has made microblading and semi-permanent makeup highly sought-after beauty solutions. These techniques promise an end to the tedious daily makeup application ritual, offering a smudge-proof, natural-looking alternative that lasts. Whether you're drawn to the precise art of microblading or the all-encompassing solution of semi-permanent makeup, these beauty enhancements are redefining convenience in the beauty world. Embrace the opportunity to simplify your beauty routine while boosting your confidence and highlighting your natural features."}]}]}], "numConvs": 1}, {"summary": "The model created structured SEO content for artworks and stock photos, adhering to commercial and platform-specific guidelines.
