The user then requested a journal entry from the AI about its experience responding to the conversation.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Journal", "value": "The user asked about the differences between an Ivy League university and a state university. The user then requested a journal entry from the AI about its experience responding to the conversation."}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the difference between an Ivy League like Yale and UCONN and a state university?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The distinction between an Ivy League school like Yale and a state university such as the University of Connecticut (UCONN) involves several factors including their histories, funding sources, admissions selectivity, and sometimes the scope of their academic programs and research opportunities. Understanding these differences requires examining both their characteristics and the roles they play in higher education.\n\n1. **History and Membership**: Ivy League schools are part of an athletic conference that includes eight private universities in the Northeastern United States: Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Penn, Princeton, and Yale. The term \"Ivy League\" has also come to be associated more broadly with academic excellence, selectivity in admissions, and social elitism. UCONN, on the other hand, is a public research university and the flagship of the Connecticut State Universities system. It was established as a land-grant university and serves as a major public education and research facility.\n\n2. **Funding and Tuition**: One of the fundamental differences lies in their funding sources. Ivy League schools, including Yale, are privately funded institutions, primarily relying on tuition, endowments, and donations. These endowments can be substantial, allowing for significant financial aid programs. State universities like UCONN receive a portion of their funding from the state government, which can help lower tuition rates for in-state residents. However, this also means they can be more susceptible to state budget cuts.\n\n3. **Admissions**: Ivy League universities are known for their highly selective admissions process, with very low acceptance rates. They attract a large pool of applicants, including many of the top students from around the world. State universities generally have higher acceptance rates and may have admissions policies that focus more on serving students from their respective states.\n\n4. **Academic and Research Opportunities**: Both types of institutions offer a wide range of undergraduate and graduate programs, but the Ivy League schools often have more resources to support research initiatives, facilities, and opportunities for undergraduates to engage in research. This is not to say that state universities like UCONN do not offer research opportunities; many state universities are also significant research institutions but may have different focuses or resources available.\n\n5. **Campus Life and Student Body**: Campus life can differ significantly between these institutions, partially due to size and the diversity of the student body. Ivy League schools tend to have smaller enrollments, which can foster a different social environment compared to the often larger state universities. State universities may have a more diverse student body in terms of socioeconomic background, partly because of their mission to serve their state's residents.\n\n6. **Athletics**: While both types of institutions participate in college athletics, the level and intensity can vary. Ivy League schools compete in Division I sports but do not offer athletic scholarships and have their unique set of rules regarding athletics. State universities, depending on their specific conferences, might offer athletic scholarships and often compete at a high level in a variety of sports, which can play a more central role in campus life and school identity.\n\nIn summary, while both Ivy League schools like Yale and state universities like UCONN play crucial roles in higher education, they differ in their history, funding, admissions selectivity, and sometimes in the scope and focus of academic and research programs. Both, however, strive to provide high-quality education and opportunities for their students."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user asked about the differences between an Ivy League school and a state university.

Here are some of the key differences:\n\n1. **Academic Prestige and History**: Ivy League schools, including Yale, are part of an athletic conference made up of eight private institutions in the Northeastern United States that are often associated with academic excellence, selectivity in admissions, and a long history of tradition. These schools have a global reputation that attracts students from all over the world. Yale, founded in 1701, is one of the oldest and most prestigious universities in the United States.\n\n2. **Public vs. Private**: Yale is a private institution, whereas UCONN is a public university funded and operated by the State of Connecticut. This difference in funding sources influences tuition costs, financial aid offerings, and sometimes the resources available to students and faculty.\n\n3. **Size and Student Body**: Generally, state universities like UCONN tend to have larger student bodies compared to Ivy League schools. This might affect the student-to-faculty ratio, class sizes, and the sense of community on campus. UCONN, for example, serves thousands of undergraduate and graduate students across multiple campuses, whereas Yale, despite its global reputation, maintains a smaller, more intimate campus environment.\n\n4. **Tuition and Financial Aid**: As a public university, UCONN offers lower tuition rates for in-state students compared to the tuition rates at Yale. However, Yale and other Ivy League schools have substantial endowments, allowing them to offer generous financial aid packages based on need, which can sometimes make attending an Ivy League school as economical or even more so for low and middle-income students compared to attending a state university.\n\n5. **Programs and Research Opportunities**: Both Yale and UCONN offer a wide range of undergraduate and graduate programs, but the specific strengths and reputations of these programs can vary. Ivy League schools often have more resources to support research, small seminar classes, and opportunities for undergraduate students to engage in research projects. State universities may offer a broader array of applied and professional programs, reflecting their broader mission to serve the educational needs of their state.\n\n6. **Campus Culture and Extracurricular Opportunities**: The campus culture can vary significantly between an Ivy League school like Yale and a state university like UCONN, influenced by factors such as the history of the institution, the size of the student body, and the nature of student activities and traditions. Both environments offer rich extracurricular and leadership opportunities, but the vibe and breadth of activities may differ.\n\n7. **Selectivity and Admissions**: Ivy League schools are known for their highly selective admissions processes, with low acceptance rates reflecting competition for a limited number of spots. State universities tend to have higher acceptance rates and may provide greater access for in-state residents.\n\nIn summary, while both Ivy League schools and state universities offer high-quality education, their differences in terms of prestige, size, culture, affordability, and selectivity reflect their distinct histories, missions, and the populations they serve. The choice between such institutions depends on the individual needs, financial situations, academic interests, and personal preferences of prospective students."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user asked about the difference between 200 MP and 48 MP.

Resolution:\n- **200 MP** offers a resolution of approximately 200 million pixels, meaning the potential for extremely high-detail images is substantial. For example, a common resolution output for a 200 MP sensor could be 16200 x 12200 pixels.\n- **48 MP**, while still high-resolution, provides about 48 million pixels, translating to images with a resolution around 8000 x 6000 pixels.\n\n### 2. Image Detail and Cropping Potential:\n- With **200 MP**, you gain the ability to capture incredibly detailed and crisp images, which is particularly useful for large prints or for cropping significantly into a photo without losing much detail.\n- **48 MP** also offers a high level of detail, suitable for standard professional needs, including large prints and cropping, but to a lesser extent compared to 200 MP.\n\n### 3. File Size and Storage:\n- Images taken at **200 MP** will have significantly larger file sizes than those taken at **48 MP**. This means more storage will be required, both on memory cards and for any kind of archival purposes.\n- **48 MP** images are also large but somewhat more manageable in terms of storage requirements compared to 200 MP images.\n\n### 4. Processing Power:\n- Processing **200 MP** images requires more powerful and sophisticated hardware, both in the camera and for post-processing on computers. This could also mean slower shooting speeds in burst mode and longer times to process and edit photos.\n- **48 MP** images are less demanding in comparison, which could mean faster processing times and less strain on hardware.\n\n### 5. Practicality and Use Cases:\n- **200 MP** is often overkill for everyday use and even for many professional applications. Such high resolutions are primarily beneficial in specialized fields like high-resolution product photography, digital archiving, and large-scale prints.\n- **48 MP** offers a good balance between high resolution and practical file sizes, making it suitable for a wide range of professional and amateur uses, including landscape, portrait, and even somewhat larger prints.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe choice between 200 MP and 48 MP should be based on your specific needs, including the desired detail level, intended use of the images, and the processing and storage capabilities you have available. For most general photography needs, 48 MP is more than sufficient, while 200 MP caters to specialized high-demand scenarios."}]}]}], "numConvs": 7}, {"summary": "The user asked about manuscript submission and APC waiver processes, specifically seeking clarification on where to input standard APC information after a transfer from another journal.

0:0:21.720\nKeith Low\nI think more focused on what happened when the license, I mean being starts right when it expires or when the license were deactivated.\n0:0:22.310 --> 0:0:24.150\nKeith Low\nI mean, what is the expected behavior?\n0:0:31.930 --> 0:0:41.100\nChris DiPierro\nSo just to so context here, right, we've built the licensing service, we've deployed licenses to attend.\n0:0:41.430 --> 0:0:42.360\nChris DiPierro\nExcuse me to a tenant.\n0:0:42.870 --> 0:0:46.420\nChris DiPierro\nWe've used them up or while use some number of them off, I suppose.\n0:0:46.600 --> 0:0:50.790\nChris DiPierro\nAnd now we hit the expiration of the licensing period, right?\n0:0:50.800 --> 0:0:54.860\nChris DiPierro\nSo what you're looking for, Keith, is kind of expected behavior from that part.\n0:0:54.910 --> 0:0:55.90\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:0:54.870 --> 0:0:55.800\nChris DiPierro\nAre we being?\n0:0:56.70 --> 0:0:58.380\nChris DiPierro\nAre we being prescriptive about this?\n0:0:58.430 --> 0:1:0.780\nChris DiPierro\nLike hey, your license is expired.\n0:1:0.790 --> 0:1:2.890\nChris DiPierro\nYou can't log in as well.\n0:1:2.900 --> 0:1:8.490\nChris DiPierro\nCan't get into your application at all or you be in warning about this.\n0:1:8.840 --> 0:1:12.450\nChris DiPierro\nWhat you know is it different for different classifications of users?\n0:1:12.460 --> 0:1:13.300\nChris DiPierro\nI think would be a question.\n0:1:13.630 --> 0:1:14.860\nChris DiPierro\nUh, you know?\n0:1:14.900 --> 0:1:21.660\nChris DiPierro\nOr is it just more on our backside, right, like we're saying, hey, we need to notify ourselves at this tenants licenses are expired.\n0:1:21.670 --> 0:1:22.410\nChris DiPierro\nYou know, like where?\n0:1:22.420 --> 0:1:24.930\nChris DiPierro\nWhere do we think we wanna land on on that kind of thing?\n0:1:32.900 --> 0:1:34.0\nStephanie Jones\nIs this a question for me?\n0:1:35.150 --> 0:1:35.860\nChris DiPierro\nI think so.\n0:1:34.980 --> 0:1:36.80\nKeith Low\nUh, yeah.\n0:1:34.870 --> 0:1:36.260\nJoshua Haseldine\nAs well, saying this question 2.\n0:1:37.280 --> 0:1:37.540\nStephanie Jones\nOK.\n0:1:35.950 --> 0:1:37.660\nChris DiPierro\nI I think so.\n0:1:38.190 --> 0:1:41.440\nChris DiPierro\nYou know, I I I think it's a question.\n0:1:46.160 --> 0:1:46.340\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:1:41.450 --> 0:1:50.60\nChris DiPierro\nI think it's a question to answer more broadly than ARC, but since you guys happen to be going first probably I think it would be good to know what your expectations are.\n0:1:50.870 --> 0:1:51.200\nStephanie Jones\nHmm.\n0:1:51.520 --> 0:1:51.930\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:1:52.490 --> 0:1:56.930\nStephanie Jones\nUmm, I mean, when a license expires, I would think that someone would.\n0:1:58.650 --> 0:1:59.110\nStephanie Jones\nHave to be.\n0:2:9.10 --> 0:2:9.220\nKeith Low\nMm-hmm.\n0:2:0.790 --> 0:2:10.80\nStephanie Jones\nI mean, ideally I think there would be some sort of notification period like your license is going to expire in 30 days, 60 days, whatever the case may be, to give someone an opportunity.\n0:2:10.230 --> 0:2:27.360\nStephanie Jones\nIt feels harsh to just cut off umm to cut off access without giving prior notification, O because someone could be in the middle of an audit and not even realize that their license for the software is expiring.\n0:2:27.890 --> 0:2:28.110\nChris DiPierro\nUmm.\n0:2:28.710 --> 0:2:28.870\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:2:27.370 --> 0:2:30.580\nStephanie Jones\nSo they're trying to get their work done or you know, it can be.\n0:2:30.920 --> 0:2:32.720\nStephanie Jones\nIt obeys Oxley.\n0:2:32.730 --> 0:2:39.570\nStephanie Jones\nAuditors specifically, they could be under a tight deadline, just kind of like CPA is our, you know, under a tight deadline at certain dates.\n0:2:39.580 --> 0:2:44.560\nStephanie Jones\nSo they if they had to renew a license and it had to go through.\n0:2:46.470 --> 0:2:47.820\nStephanie Jones\nA financial process.\n0:2:47.830 --> 0:2:50.840\nStephanie Jones\nThen they may not have time for that, and I'd hate to.\n0:2:50.890 --> 0:3:6.930\nStephanie Jones\nI think it would cause a lot of ill will to just cut it off, so I think there would be a notification that the license is about to expire and then once it expires I don't know if we offer a grace period but but I don't think someone should just continue to use an expired license.\n0:3:8.300 --> 0:3:8.520\nChris DiPierro\nYeah.\n0:3:7.860 --> 0:3:14.140\nStephanie Jones\nSo at the minimum, I think there's a notice period and then a cut off, but a grace period might be nice too.\n0:3:15.250 --> 0:3:15.680\nChris DiPierro\nYeah.\n0:3:15.690 --> 0:3:19.800\nChris DiPierro\nSo this this starts to get into some pretty nuanced questions pretty quickly, right?\n0:3:20.310 --> 0:3:20.630\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:3:19.810 --> 0:3:25.910\nChris DiPierro\nSo so if we talk about the the expiring period, right, 3060 days, whatever you wanna call it?\n0:3:26.390 --> 0:3:27.400\nChris DiPierro\nUmm, who?\n0:3:27.410 --> 0:3:30.380\nChris DiPierro\nWho should get notified as a question that I'd have right away, right?\n0:3:34.750 --> 0:3:35.50\nStephanie Jones\nRight.\n0:3:30.390 --> 0:3:41.540\nChris DiPierro\nLike you were saying yesterday that your average tenant is gonna have 20 ish users or whatever, but the but the average auditor presumably has nothing to do with the procurement of the audit software, right?\n0:3:40.730 --> 0:3:43.140\nStephanie Jones\nYeah. Umm.\n0:3:41.610 --> 0:3:46.90\nChris DiPierro\nSo the do we tell everybody that their license is expiring?\n0:3:46.100 --> 0:3:50.720\nChris DiPierro\nDo we tell that only they tenant admins that they're licenses are expiring?\n0:3:51.890 --> 0:3:52.110\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:3:50.730 --> 0:3:54.20\nChris DiPierro\nYou know, I think there's pluses and minuses to both of those, right.\n0:3:55.310 --> 0:3:55.680\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:3:54.530 --> 0:4:4.280\nChris DiPierro\nClearly we could put up a notification to everybody every time you use arc and say, hey, you got, you know, 30 days left or whatever to encourage them to go reach out to their org.\n0:4:4.350 --> 0:4:11.880\nChris DiPierro\nBut if that to in your face basically like hey, look great, that's gonna be handled by my admin.\n0:4:11.890 --> 0:4:14.490\nChris DiPierro\nI don't really care, you know, kind of stuff.\n0:4:14.410 --> 0:4:14.650\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:4:17.400 --> 0:4:19.590\nStephanie Jones\nGreat. Umm.\n0:4:22.10 --> 0:4:22.380\nJoshua Haseldine\nI mean.\n0:4:21.900 --> 0:4:24.20\nStephanie Jones\nI don't think everyone needs to be notified.\n0:4:25.840 --> 0:4:26.120\nChris DiPierro\nRight.\n0:4:24.100 --> 0:4:26.670\nStephanie Jones\nI would think the tenant admin go ahead, Josh.\n0:4:27.190 --> 0:4:28.410\nJoshua Haseldine\nNo, go on.\n0:4:29.310 --> 0:4:30.620\nStephanie Jones\nWhere you going is that was.\n0:4:30.860 --> 0:4:31.570\nJoshua Haseldine\nNo, I was.\n0:4:30.690 --> 0:4:31.610\nStephanie Jones\nIs that what you were going to say?\n0:4:33.520 --> 0:4:34.250\nStephanie Jones\nEverybody.\n0:4:34.460 --> 0:4:36.400\nStephanie Jones\nYeah, yeah.\n0:4:39.330 --> 0:4:39.560\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:4:45.570 --> 0:4:46.350\nChris DiPierro\nWell, yeah, sure.\n0:4:47.360 --> 0:4:47.540\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:4:46.360 --> 0:4:47.970\nChris DiPierro\nRight. Umm.\n0:4:31.580 --> 0:4:57.840\nJoshua Haseldine\nI was actually leaning towards the opposite of being having the the usability of everyone is like I I understand that you know, you don't need to be addressed every time you log in, so to say you have, what, 300 days left or whatever, but say 30 day grace period and then and then you like every individual user gets notified because then it's not just putting it on the admin who's say logs off for two months with sick or whatever.\n0:4:58.660 --> 0:4:58.870\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:5:6.370 --> 0:5:6.550\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:5:7.230 --> 0:5:7.920\nKeith Low\nUmm.\n0:5:10.90 --> 0:5:10.290\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:4:58.810 --> 0:5:17.20\nJoshua Haseldine\nI'm it's putting it on the user to then also be proactive to go and like speak to the admin who will, who will also get the notification as well to say that this user is expiring to basically inform the user that their license isn't is done.\n0:5:16.150 --> 0:5:18.640\nStephanie Jones\nUmm yeah.\n0:5:18.590 --> 0:5:19.290\nJoshua Haseldine\nThat's my take on it.\n0:5:18.730 --> 0:5:19.670\nStephanie Jones\nI mean that makes sense.\n0:5:20.310 --> 0:5:20.530\nKeith Low\nOK.\n0:5:21.180 --> 0:5:21.410\nChris DiPierro\nIt.\n0:5:20.430 --> 0:5:25.400\nStephanie Jones\nI right I I think that would really apply for umm.\n0:5:27.720 --> 0:5:28.90\nStephanie Jones\nRight.\n0:5:28.100 --> 0:5:34.490\nStephanie Jones\nI guess thinking about who was our our average customer, right, if there's 20 people, yeah, that would make sense.\n0:5:34.560 --> 0:5:38.510\nStephanie Jones\nCarnival with 100 and some would be like OK, does everyone need to see that?\n0:5:38.520 --> 0:5:43.690\nStephanie Jones\nBut that's more the exception those larger clients so.\n0:5:44.290 --> 0:5:47.460\nChris DiPierro\nYeah, I mean, and and there's probably some compromises here too, right?\n0:5:47.470 --> 0:5:53.760\nChris DiPierro\nLike we could absolutely believe a world where an admin starts to get notifications like 60 days out or something like that.\n0:5:54.270 --> 0:5:59.630\nChris DiPierro\nBut maybe your average user only gets notifications like 2 weeks out or something, right?\n0:6:7.70 --> 0:6:7.380\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:5:59.640 --> 0:6:14.740\nChris DiPierro\nLike, hey, this is still an issue or even a week or whatever it might be, you know, to try to reinsurance from that perspective, I think that's a little bit separate by the way from a grace period like grace period is like post license expiration, right?\n0:6:14.750 --> 0:6:34.700\nChris DiPierro\nWe certainly talk about having that sort of thing, which would bring up, but that brings up the question of does that need to be configurable like, you know, when I've done, when I've implemented licensing systems in the past, right, uh, one of the things that you could actually set in the license itself was the if there was a grace period at all for one.\n0:6:34.710 --> 0:6:36.580\nChris DiPierro\nBut if there was, how long that would be?\n0:6:41.730 --> 0:6:41.940\nKeith Low\nUmm.\n0:6:36.590 --> 0:6:45.130\nChris DiPierro\nYou know, I guess the question that we would need to answer, you know, I guess Keith is how how can figure builder we want this right?\n0:6:49.660 --> 0:6:49.880\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:6:45.140 --> 0:6:50.340\nChris DiPierro\nLike, do we think that they're gonna be different needs for that kind of thing and different products certainly could be right.\n0:6:50.430 --> 0:6:53.240\nChris DiPierro\nCould could be that ARC is generous, right?\n0:6:53.250 --> 0:6:57.680\nChris DiPierro\nAnd has like a 30 day grace period, like using it an unlicensed state.\n0:6:57.690 --> 0:7:5.640\nChris DiPierro\nAs Stephanie said, there's, you know, audits in progress or whatever that can't be interrupted and you know the paperwork was getting signed right on the backside.\n0:7:7.490 --> 0:7:7.620\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:7:8.200 --> 0:7:8.400\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:7:5.890 --> 0:7:12.540\nChris DiPierro\nOn the other hand, there might be other products that won't be much more prescriptive that say, sorry, day zero, you're done right?\n0:7:13.910 --> 0:7:14.150\nStephanie Jones\nMm-hmm.\n0:7:13.80 --> 0:7:14.350\nChris DiPierro\nAh, so.\n0:7:14.360 --> 0:7:16.700\nKeith Low\nI think, yeah, I think that that is actually a good point.\n0:7:17.270 --> 0:7:19.240\nKeith Low\nUh, I think previously.\n0:7:19.460 --> 0:7:20.720\nKeith Low\nA long time ago.\n0:7:21.250 --> 0:7:22.150\nKeith Low\nStephanie, I'm not sure.\n0:7:22.160 --> 0:7:24.920\nKeith Low\nYou still remember where we discussed with Jason and Chrissy?\n0:7:25.130 --> 0:7:34.0\nKeith Low\nI think it was mentioned that we didn't want to do hot lock, meaning that then once expire we lock everybody out.\n0:7:35.220 --> 0:7:35.540\nStephanie Jones\nRight.\n0:7:34.10 --> 0:7:35.560\nKeith Low\nI think that was not what we wanted to do.\n0:7:37.940 --> 0:7:38.150\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:7:37.240 --> 0:7:38.970\nChris DiPierro\nI think you have to do it eventually, right?\n0:7:39.690 --> 0:7:39.840\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:7:44.480 --> 0:7:44.770\nKeith Low\nUmm.\n0:7:38.980 --> 0:7:45.320\nChris DiPierro\nYou can't just let people operate in an unlicensed state, like for every right is what?\n0:7:45.780 --> 0:7:46.520\nChris DiPierro\nIt comes down to you.\n0:7:48.40 --> 0:7:48.230\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:7:48.790 --> 0:7:49.190\nStephanie Jones\nAgreed.\n0:7:48.240 --> 0:7:52.590\nKeith Low\nSo probably we can consider like like a a great period like 2 weeks which depends on the product.\n0:7:52.600 --> 0:8:0.330\nKeith Low\nFor example, like ARC, choose two weeks and after that two weeks where we will continuously notify the user and admin if nothing is done.\n0:8:0.680 --> 0:8:2.840\nKeith Low\nLuckily, user after two weeks.\n0:8:2.600 --> 0:8:3.110\nChris DiPierro\nYeah, I.\n0:8:3.200 --> 0:8:4.70\nChris DiPierro\nWell, a couple things.\n0:8:4.80 --> 0:8:6.150\nChris DiPierro\nI think we need to define what we mean by notify.\n0:8:23.170 --> 0:8:23.430\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:8:6.600 --> 0:8:26.350\nChris DiPierro\nSorry to make this a little bit more, you know, complicated along the way, but I think kind of what we've said is some period out you know let's just say for the sake of argument, two months out, admins start being notified that the license is going to expire in this case by notified.\n0:8:26.360 --> 0:8:28.840\nChris DiPierro\nI think clearly if they log in, that's fine.\n0:8:28.850 --> 0:8:30.700\nChris DiPierro\nThey should, you know, see something when they log in.\n0:8:31.140 --> 0:8:35.870\nChris DiPierro\nUmm, but to Joshua Point, you might have admins that just don't log in for a long time.\n0:8:35.880 --> 0:8:38.290\nChris DiPierro\nThey're not the ones doing the audience that no, maybe no need.\n0:8:38.300 --> 0:8:41.810\nChris DiPierro\nNo users are being provisioned or whatever, so they really have no reason to to log in.\n0:8:42.20 --> 0:8:50.530\nChris DiPierro\nSo I think notification in that sense probably has to mean some sort of email notification that's going to the admin periodically.\n0:8:50.680 --> 0:8:51.860\nChris DiPierro\nNot probably.\n0:8:51.870 --> 0:8:54.650\nChris DiPierro\nNot every day that we kind of over the top.\n0:8:56.460 --> 0:9:2.680\nChris DiPierro\nBut you know, maybe you, you know, this is another thing that I've designed in the past, but basically.\n0:9:4.970 --> 0:9:7.880\nChris DiPierro\nYou know, do that 60 days do that, 45 days do it.\n0:9:7.890 --> 0:9:13.240\nChris DiPierro\n30 but once you start getting tighter, then you know, once you get into a week or something, maybe it is Daily at that point, right.\n0:9:13.750 --> 0:9:14.120\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:9:14.70 --> 0:9:14.210\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:9:13.250 --> 0:9:14.300\nChris DiPierro\nI think you've seen.\n0:9:14.310 --> 0:9:19.900\nChris DiPierro\nI'm sure you've all seen behavior like that from underneath their Microsoft or wherever else that you might have scriptions from.\n0:9:21.950 --> 0:9:34.170\nChris DiPierro\nAnd then I think what we said once we get into some sort of critical period, you know, for the sake of this conversation and or maybe a first draft right up maybe say a week out, we start notifying regular users as well.\n0:9:34.180 --> 0:9:36.180\nChris DiPierro\nBut in that case, I don't think we're emailing the users.\n0:9:36.190 --> 0:9:39.80\nChris DiPierro\nI think we're just showing it to them when they log in, right?\n0:9:39.90 --> 0:9:39.210\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:9:39.90 --> 0:9:40.320\nChris DiPierro\nWe don't wanna just spam everybody.\n0:9:41.260 --> 0:9:41.460\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:9:51.860 --> 0:9:52.150\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:9:42.320 --> 0:9:53.460\nChris DiPierro\nOnce you get to a point of grace period, which I think we're saying could be defined either by the product or perhaps per tenant, you know, maybe we wanna be nicer to some tenants than other tenants.\n0:9:53.750 --> 0:9:58.300\nChris DiPierro\nUh, again anytime anybody logs in.\n0:9:58.350 --> 0:9:59.990\nChris DiPierro\nClearly they should be notified at that point.\n0:10:0.680 --> 0:10:3.710\nChris DiPierro\nAgain, admin should at that point probably be emailed daily.\n0:10:4.270 --> 0:10:11.660\nChris DiPierro\nUh Grace period lasts for however long the grace period lasts, but there's still becomes eventually a hard lockout.\n0:10:12.620 --> 0:10:12.820\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:10:11.670 --> 0:10:13.90\nChris DiPierro\nYou use up your grace period.\n0:10:13.100 --> 0:10:14.440\nChris DiPierro\nYou get past all of that.\n0:10:14.450 --> 0:10:20.0\nChris DiPierro\nSorry, you get eventually, just get a screen that so sorry you can't do this, you know, Hope.\n0:10:20.40 --> 0:10:36.730\nChris DiPierro\nIdeally, something that is, you know informative about that you click on the launch, you know internal audit link from IHOME or whatever and it says it doesn't just like you know, it's not just product not found basically it's more along the lines of sorry, you can't do that.\n0:10:36.740 --> 0:10:37.740\nChris DiPierro\nYour license has expired.\n0:10:37.750 --> 0:10:38.760\nChris DiPierro\nYou exceed your grace, period.\n0:10:40.470 --> 0:10:40.630\nStephanie Jones\nYes.\n0:10:44.180 --> 0:10:44.820\nStephanie Jones\nI agree with that.\n0:10:38.770 --> 0:10:45.120\nChris DiPierro\nContact your admin or whatever you know, or if you're the admin, contact ideagen I guess but something like that, right?\n0:10:45.790 --> 0:10:46.240\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:11:0.830 --> 0:11:0.970\nChris DiPierro\nYeah.\n0:10:46.250 --> 0:11:1.960\nStephanie Jones\nSo it's it's like a configurable grace period or I'm sorry, a configurable notice period, a configurable grace period and then another notification at the conclusion or a message at the conclusion of that grace period.\n0:11:3.160 --> 0:11:10.790\nChris DiPierro\nI think the other notification that probably needs to happen here is notifying us somewhere along the line and by us I mean the the royal US have idea.\n0:11:13.160 --> 0:11:13.360\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:11:10.800 --> 0:11:14.230\nChris DiPierro\nJen I don't know exactly who the correct notification is.\n0:11:14.860 --> 0:11:29.800\nChris DiPierro\nOne one thing that we I don't know if this is a thing or not, but I think that we might need to consider Keith is when we provision a tenant uh, we might need to have some meta information about that tenant.\n0:11:29.810 --> 0:11:30.180\nChris DiPierro\nLike who?\n0:11:32.120 --> 0:11:32.300\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:11:32.120 --> 0:11:32.390\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:11:30.190 --> 0:11:38.120\nChris DiPierro\nThe account Rep on the idea that inside is for that I guess the ideal answer is this would all be pullable from Salesforce or something like that.\n0:11:47.450 --> 0:11:47.640\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:11:52.630 --> 0:11:52.870\nStephanie Jones\nLike.\n0:11:38.130 --> 0:11:54.130\nChris DiPierro\nBut in the absence of a specific Salesforce integration right now, maybe when we deploy a tenant we say this one is responsible by this AR and you know that that at least that person may be somebody else also gets licensed expiration notifications.\n0:11:55.240 --> 0:11:55.520\nStephanie Jones\nRight.\n0:11:55.530 --> 0:11:57.650\nStephanie Jones\nI'm thinking the account manager, right?\n0:11:57.430 --> 0:11:58.190\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:11:57.660 --> 0:11:58.770\nStephanie Jones\nAnd you're exactly right.\n0:12:2.420 --> 0:12:2.600\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:12:3.890 --> 0:12:4.230\nChris DiPierro\nIdeally.\n0:12:6.580 --> 0:12:6.730\nChris DiPierro\nYeah.\n0:11:58.780 --> 0:12:12.460\nStephanie Jones\nIdeally that would come from whoever it would Ping sales force and see who that person is, but then also our renewals right ideally, but then also our renewals, we have a renewals department here, so renewals would be informed as well.\n0:12:13.280 --> 0:12:13.490\nChris DiPierro\nUmm.\n0:12:13.300 --> 0:12:19.230\nKeith Low\nUmm, OK, I think the the next question is imagine after the Hadlock what happened.\n0:12:19.660 --> 0:12:23.210\nKeith Low\nSo we will release that license, OK.\n0:12:23.220 --> 0:12:27.190\nKeith Low\nFor example, you have to empty UH-10 expire.\n0:12:29.140 --> 0:12:30.910\nChris DiPierro\nI well, yeah.\n0:12:31.50 --> 0:12:32.540\nChris DiPierro\nWell, let's talk about that for a second.\n0:12:32.550 --> 0:12:34.990\nChris DiPierro\nSo it do we ever have that state?\n0:12:40.40 --> 0:12:40.680\nStephanie Jones\nWhat were you?\n0:12:35.0 --> 0:12:45.270\nChris DiPierro\nBasically, I think Keith, you've asked me this before, but we're kind of making an assumption that if we have like 20 users that that we might have different expirations to different licenses.\n0:12:45.970 --> 0:12:46.370\nStephanie Jones\nOhh.\n0:12:45.280 --> 0:12:46.530\nChris DiPierro\nBut is that?\n0:12:46.920 --> 0:12:49.730\nChris DiPierro\nIs that really true?\n0:12:49.820 --> 0:12:58.630\nChris DiPierro\nIs that how we sell like, like if I'm a customer, right, and I buy 10 now and then six months from now, I realize I need 10 more, right?\n0:12:59.640 --> 0:13:5.570\nChris DiPierro\nThe way I've usually seen license and handling is you kind of prorate that second batch and everybody expires on the same time.\n0:13:6.140 --> 0:13:6.390\nKeith Low\nUmm.\n0:13:10.780 --> 0:13:10.980\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:13:5.580 --> 0:13:11.450\nChris DiPierro\nYou don't have like different expiry dates because otherwise it gets really complicated really quickly.\n0:13:11.460 --> 0:13:11.670\nChris DiPierro\nWho?\n0:13:11.620 --> 0:13:11.860\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:13:11.840 --> 0:13:13.70\nChris DiPierro\nAre you notifying about what?\n0:13:13.80 --> 0:13:23.440\nChris DiPierro\nWhen I would really like to exclude that scenario, if we if we can umm, I guess it does bring up the question though in like audit excuse me.\n0:13:23.450 --> 0:13:29.490\nChris DiPierro\nIn ARC, there's two different at least two different license types that you spoken about before I write, there's an audit license in the risk license, potentially future.\n0:13:29.500 --> 0:13:31.0\nChris DiPierro\nThere's other kinds of licenses.\n0:13:31.570 --> 0:13:38.920\nChris DiPierro\nWould we ever have those expire at different times or could we kind of just say no?\n0:13:38.930 --> 0:13:42.720\nChris DiPierro\nSorry, they're always gonna, you know, whatever your renewal period is your renewal period.\n0:13:48.700 --> 0:13:48.890\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:13:42.730 --> 0:13:50.310\nChris DiPierro\nIf you've added on mid year or whatever some other license type that gets per added to the renewal date like how do we how do we sell?\n0:13:52.630 --> 0:13:58.180\nStephanie Jones\nI I don't know the answer to that question, but I can find out about.\n0:13:58.690 --> 0:13:59.300\nStephanie Jones\nI would.\n0:13:59.310 --> 0:13:59.570\nStephanie Jones\nI would.\n0:13:58.50 --> 0:14:0.640\nChris DiPierro\nYeah, if we can influence it.\n0:14:1.340 --> 0:14:1.540\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:14:5.820 --> 0:14:6.60\nChris DiPierro\nUmm.\n0:14:1.540 --> 0:14:11.990\nStephanie Jones\nI would like to hope that if you purchased 10 audit licenses and then you're and then a year later, you're like oh, we hired someone, we have 11, that it's not too separate dates.\n0:14:12.740 --> 0:14:13.40\nChris DiPierro\nRight.\n0:14:12.0 --> 0:14:23.630\nStephanie Jones\nYou're managing within audit, but I can see if you have a risk IDEAGEN risk set of licenses and an idea Gen audit set of licenses that they would be a different date.\n0:14:25.400 --> 0:14:26.0\nChris DiPierro\nYou can do that.\n0:14:24.80 --> 0:14:26.910\nStephanie Jones\nI can see that happening because it's two separate departments.\n0:14:28.0 --> 0:14:28.270\nKeith Low\nUmm.\n0:14:30.220 --> 0:14:30.460\nChris DiPierro\nYeah.\n0:14:35.100 --> 0:14:36.660\nJoshua Haseldine\nI I'm trying to think of a you.\n0:14:33.560 --> 0:14:36.840\nChris DiPierro\nI just trying to think about the practicality of that right because I.\n0:14:33.800 --> 0:14:37.880\nStephanie Jones\nJosh, Josh let's face is speaking to me.\n0:14:39.250 --> 0:14:39.750\nJoshua Haseldine\nI don't.\n0:14:39.970 --> 0:14:40.100\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:14:42.520 --> 0:14:51.670\nJoshua Haseldine\nBut if it's still under the same blanket of the same company, then surely it would still be handled by like whoever the licensing will still be handled by the same people regardless of the audit and risk.\n0:14:53.180 --> 0:14:53.400\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:14:52.40 --> 0:14:55.30\nJoshua Haseldine\nSo I can't see why they would be 2 separate days.\n0:14:56.810 --> 0:15:5.770\nStephanie Jones\nUmm I guess because I mean and we we really haven't dealt with this before much because we don't really have a company right now.\n0:15:12.690 --> 0:15:12.910\nJoshua Haseldine\nYeah.\n0:15:5.950 --> 0:15:16.90\nStephanie Jones\nI mean, we have a couple I guess and I don't know how they're handled, but it's not the norm for us to have a risk department using our software pentana risk.\n0:15:16.100 --> 0:15:20.170\nStephanie Jones\nAnd then an audit department using Pentana audit like we don't have very many of those right now.\n0:15:20.930 --> 0:15:21.120\nChris DiPierro\nOK.\n0:15:20.360 --> 0:15:25.270\nStephanie Jones\nSo I mean, I guess the reason why I say that is because it's here.\n0:15:50.400 --> 0:15:50.660\nChris DiPierro\nUmm.\n0:15:25.280 --> 0:16:0.610\nStephanie Jones\nIt is April 4th if I'm purchasing audit and I start using it May 1st and I use it and I'm very happy with it and I go to my risk department and I'm like man, you really got to use this software as well for your risk management needs if they if they're like, well, let's see, we'll evaluate other things months go by now it's January again and if the audit renewal is coming around in May, but the risk department doesn't start using it until January and has four months before they were new.\n0:16:0.620 --> 0:16:1.10\nStephanie Jones\nI don't know.\n0:16:2.490 --> 0:16:2.640\nJoshua Haseldine\nBut.\n0:16:1.20 --> 0:16:4.280\nStephanie Jones\nIt doesn't feel like there could be completely different start dates.\n0:16:4.890 --> 0:16:7.300\nJoshua Haseldine\nBut is that not the same as what the users would be?\n0:16:10.430 --> 0:16:10.670\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:16:12.630 --> 0:16:12.840\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:16:7.350 --> 0:16:15.260\nJoshua Haseldine\nSo if a user was to join, we said that like they would get and get caught up in the renewal period of, you know, everyone getting renewed.\n0:16:15.30 --> 0:16:17.170\nChris DiPierro\nWell, yeah.\n0:16:17.100 --> 0:16:17.650\nJoshua Haseldine\nWhere is?\n0:16:21.840 --> 0:16:22.570\nJoshua Haseldine\nYay, yeah.\n0:16:24.190 --> 0:16:24.410\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:16:17.180 --> 0:16:25.870\nChris DiPierro\nBut I think what's there is saying is it's kind of it's almost two separate products, right, like that it is is where I think difference is the the the the issue.\n0:16:25.940 --> 0:16:30.870\nChris DiPierro\nThe concern I have I guess, is when you have a user that has mixed licenses right?\n0:16:32.90 --> 0:16:32.270\nJoshua Haseldine\nYeah.\n0:16:35.960 --> 0:16:36.150\nStephanie Jones\nMm-hmm.\n0:16:30.940 --> 0:16:42.770\nChris DiPierro\nLike if it truly was that I had 10 auditors and 10 risk users and they never in overlapped like then managing different renewal periods might not be the worst thing in the world.\n0:16:42.840 --> 0:16:48.40\nChris DiPierro\nBut if you've got 2 users in that group that have both of those licenses, right?\n0:16:48.740 --> 0:16:52.760\nChris DiPierro\nAnd then one of those periods elapses, you know, in January, he said.\n0:16:52.770 --> 0:16:54.200\nChris DiPierro\nOnes in April or whatever.\n0:16:55.10 --> 0:16:59.160\nChris DiPierro\nWhat happens if one of those renewals doesn't happen but the other one does?\n0:16:59.580 --> 0:16:59.990\nStephanie Jones\nHow?\n0:16:59.170 --> 0:17:7.950\nChris DiPierro\nThen we drop them into your product and all of a sudden we're dropping into the product with like half the license that they would have expected to have.\n0:17:9.530 --> 0:17:9.710\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:17:7.960 --> 0:17:14.390\nChris DiPierro\nEssentially, yeah, we can notify them all we want, but it could be confusing situation at that point, right?\n0:17:14.670 --> 0:17:15.910\nStephanie Jones\nYeah, I see.\n0:17:14.430 --> 0:17:17.480\nChris DiPierro\nLike, I mean, ideally our customers renew and pay us and none of this ever happened.\n0:17:17.780 --> 0:17:23.100\nChris DiPierro\nBut you know, you know that's not once, once you have hundreds of customers, that's clearly not gonna be the case in every spot.\n0:17:23.640 --> 0:17:23.970\nStephanie Jones\nOhh.\n0:17:23.110 --> 0:17:31.980\nChris DiPierro\nSo all of a sudden we create a weird Support situation that Vincent, the auditor and risk person calls us up and says, why can I not see my audit stuff now?\n0:17:31.990 --> 0:17:37.180\nChris DiPierro\nBut I can see my wrist stuff, and because I've everybody's ignored all the warnings along the way, I mean.\n0:17:37.380 --> 0:17:45.240\nChris DiPierro\nBut you know, I think this is a question of it would be nice to know how ideagen cells software.\n0:17:47.820 --> 0:17:48.20\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:17:57.790 --> 0:17:57.990\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:17:45.430 --> 0:18:2.740\nChris DiPierro\nI don't know that answer the the, the the you know the aligning everything to a given renewal period is certainly I I think from a product perspective the the preference but sales guy's gonna sales at the end of the day.\n0:18:2.750 --> 0:18:12.150\nChris DiPierro\nSo like if somebody all sudden finds a way to get somebody to sign on the dotted line and say, hey, this is gonna be a different period, like, I don't know if we can prescribe that or not.\n0:18:18.340 --> 0:18:18.520\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:18:12.430 --> 0:18:21.30\nChris DiPierro\nSo is this is this a question that we could kind of take to them somewhere and like ask, how does this work in your process? Yeah.\n0:18:26.810 --> 0:18:27.20\nChris DiPierro\nUmm.\n0:18:22.40 --> 0:18:28.930\nStephanie Jones\nI mean I I I'll definitely ask that for within within audit like within audit or risk, how does that work?\n0:18:29.690 --> 0:18:29.810\nChris DiPierro\nYeah.\n0:18:28.980 --> 0:18:36.580\nStephanie Jones\nBut do you think I also need to ask how how sales envisions that happening for both audit and risk together?\n0:18:38.10 --> 0:18:38.920\nChris DiPierro\nYeah, a little bit.\n0:18:39.660 --> 0:18:39.870\nStephanie Jones\nOK.\n0:18:39.310 --> 0:18:47.380\nChris DiPierro\nOhh this is like it's a little bit weird because you're 1 product that's pretending to be more than one product, right?\n0:18:47.790 --> 0:18:47.990\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:18:52.770 --> 0:18:53.100\nStephanie Jones\nRight.\n0:18:47.930 --> 0:18:53.750\nChris DiPierro\nLike, I don't think we'd have this situation specifically like with an audit license and like if somebody had like a please review license, right?\n0:18:53.760 --> 0:18:54.260\nChris DiPierro\nIt doesn't matter.\n0:18:54.70 --> 0:18:54.330\nJoshua Haseldine\nMm-hmm.\n0:18:55.670 --> 0:18:56.210\nStephanie Jones\nExactly.\n0:18:54.270 --> 0:18:56.320\nChris DiPierro\nThere's expire at some different time or whatever.\n0:18:56.330 --> 0:19:10.830\nChris DiPierro\nNobody really cares, but if we're essentially hitting the same button to go to what behind the scenes is the same product we're just bringing telling the product what licenses this user has and that's where I think it gets a little bit trickier.\n0:19:12.250 --> 0:19:12.430\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:19:16.200 --> 0:19:16.630\nStephanie Jones\nOK.\n0:19:16.780 --> 0:19:17.610\nStephanie Jones\nYep, I'll find that out.\n0:19:18.220 --> 0:19:28.90\nKeith Low\nUmm, OK, I think the other question is, uh, the summing, they reduce their license, they they reduce, they have like a 20.\n0:19:28.480 --> 0:19:38.890\nKeith Low\nSo during renewal they reduce reduce because right now I think they the question is cloud OPS is manually provisioned the the user that the tenant for for the first time.\n0:19:39.420 --> 0:19:44.770\nKeith Low\nSo during renewal, you've got 20 license, but they only reduce 10.\n0:20:2.950 --> 0:20:3.260\nChris DiPierro\nRight.\n0:20:3.330 --> 0:20:3.580\nKeith Low\nUh.\n0:20:3.320 --> 0:20:4.690\nChris DiPierro\nThe licenses are at the tenant.\n0:20:4.700 --> 0:20:5.770\nChris DiPierro\nThat that's correct.\n0:20:5.780 --> 0:20:6.730\nChris DiPierro\nYeah, so.\n0:20:5.290 --> 0:20:16.660\nKeith Low\nUh, so once a provision, for example 20, it will be provisioned across all the instances and we will allocate according to to to the tenant which one is used, which one is not used.\n0:20:16.710 --> 0:20:19.220\nKeith Low\nI think the question arises during renewal.\n0:20:19.230 --> 0:20:20.990\nKeith Low\nLet's say there is a less license 10.\n0:20:21.740 --> 0:20:25.20\nKeith Low\nHow often we're not known, we will not know how to, uh.\n0:20:23.950 --> 0:20:33.770\nChris DiPierro\nYeah, I don't think and I don't think instances really matters a whole lot here because what you've said in the licensing design now is that it's really users, right.\n0:20:33.780 --> 0:20:38.710\nChris DiPierro\nSo I provisioned 20 licenses and let's just say I use up all 20 of them.\n0:20:38.720 --> 0:20:40.640\nChris DiPierro\nSome of the users are across multiple instances.\n0:20:43.360 --> 0:20:44.120\nKeith Low\nHmm yeah.\n0:20:40.650 --> 0:20:44.990\nChris DiPierro\nIt doesn't really matter because we're not counting them twice as what we've said, you get the license to get live.\n0:20:45.200 --> 0:20:46.750\nChris DiPierro\nBut yeah, I renew for fewer.\n0:20:47.580 --> 0:20:51.0\nChris DiPierro\nNow I've got 20 users that have.\n0:20:51.10 --> 0:20:54.260\nChris DiPierro\nLet's just say an audit license, and now I've only renewed ten of those.\n0:20:54.270 --> 0:20:54.930\nChris DiPierro\nYeah.\n0:20:55.20 --> 0:20:55.670\nChris DiPierro\nWhat do we do?\n0:20:55.680 --> 0:21:0.180\nChris DiPierro\nClearly written over the situation so that it that is an excellent question.\n0:21:1.770 --> 0:21:2.290\nChris DiPierro\nWhat?\n0:21:2.340 --> 0:21:5.200\nChris DiPierro\nWhat we I don't know the answer to this.\n0:21:5.210 --> 0:21:9.290\nChris DiPierro\nI feel like this one a more complicated one than the next three, by the way one.\n0:21:14.190 --> 0:21:15.210\nChris DiPierro\nWell, right, yeah.\n0:21:7.260 --> 0:21:16.690\nKeith Low\nYeah, I think the the not only this because if we reduce the 10 licence who are we going to reduce from which user that is a question we will not know.\n0:21:15.760 --> 0:21:18.300\nChris DiPierro\nExactly right.\n0:21:18.310 --> 0:21:23.880\nChris DiPierro\nSo a new license gets deployed that has fewer than the amount of users that are deployed having that already.\n0:21:24.120 --> 0:21:31.760\nChris DiPierro\nLike one thing you could do, I'm not saying this is the right by the way, but one thing you could do in that situation is you yank that license away from every user.\n0:21:31.770 --> 0:21:34.940\nChris DiPierro\nAt that point you kind of detect it, you say, well, we had 20 audit license.\n0:21:34.950 --> 0:21:35.920\nChris DiPierro\nNow we only have 10.\n0:21:36.190 --> 0:21:44.230\nChris DiPierro\nWe're gonna pull that license away from everybody, and then it's up to the tenant admin to go reprovision those licenses to whoever the 10 that are now supposed to have it.\n0:21:44.440 --> 0:21:53.320\nChris DiPierro\nIt's not amazing solve because you know that goes back to the all of a sudden another wakes up that day and had nothing to do with the renewal decision and discoveries.\n0:21:53.330 --> 0:21:55.780\nChris DiPierro\nThey can't log in because the tenant admin hasn't done anything.\n0:21:56.500 --> 0:21:59.990\nChris DiPierro\nIt is a preferences ideagen sort of thing.\n0:22:0.0 --> 0:22:2.310\nChris DiPierro\nWell, like you know, nobody's using things out of scope.\n0:22:5.50 --> 0:22:10.760\nChris DiPierro\nI think an alternative to that would be, yeah, we could.\n0:22:10.770 --> 0:22:13.860\nChris DiPierro\nWe could be very notification heavy on this, right?\n0:22:13.970 --> 0:22:15.900\nChris DiPierro\nI've got 20 uh.\n0:22:16.510 --> 0:22:19.760\nChris DiPierro\nI've got 20 audit licenses deployed.\n0:22:19.770 --> 0:22:22.560\nChris DiPierro\nI only own 10 now and this can only be in this situation.\n0:22:26.480 --> 0:22:26.600\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:22:22.570 --> 0:22:41.50\nChris DiPierro\nIt would never be in a spot where I could have over deployed it to start with, presumably, but now in this cutback state I could we could start showing the notification to everybody that says, you know, hey, you only have 10 licenses, but you've got more than that users provisioned.\n0:22:41.730 --> 0:22:45.770\nChris DiPierro\nUh, we could make it sound more ominous than it really is.\n0:22:45.780 --> 0:22:48.900\nChris DiPierro\nBut like that, you know, you may be able to.\n0:22:48.910 --> 0:22:50.820\nChris DiPierro\nYou may not be able to use the software soon.\n0:22:50.830 --> 0:23:3.960\nChris DiPierro\nMight be like a thing that we could say to the average user while at the same time again going pretty hard on notifications to the account manager and to the tenant admin of like hey, you've gotta go deeper vision.\n0:23:3.970 --> 0:23:8.430\nChris DiPierro\nSome of these spokes right like that would be the if you will more friendly way to do things.\n0:23:9.480 --> 0:23:9.690\nStephanie Jones\nWhy?\n0:23:12.290 --> 0:23:12.690\nStephanie Jones\nHmm.\n0:23:12.950 --> 0:23:27.910\nStephanie Jones\nWhy is it necessary to OK so if if the five of us are an audit team and then Josh and I leave our audit team, so now there's three, why do why?\n0:23:28.0 --> 0:23:33.230\nStephanie Jones\nWhy does Vincent, who has nothing to do with Josh and I leaving, have to have his license taken away?\n0:23:33.240 --> 0:23:34.340\nStephanie Jones\nAnd then readded.\n0:23:34.350 --> 0:23:35.980\nStephanie Jones\nWhy can't ours just be removed?\n0:23:37.320 --> 0:23:37.790\nKeith Low\nNo, no.\n0:23:37.590 --> 0:23:38.380\nChris DiPierro\nWell, it could it.\n0:23:37.800 --> 0:23:39.590\nKeith Low\nI think the situation is not like that.\n0:23:39.600 --> 0:23:40.830\nKeith Low\nImagine five of us.\n0:23:40.840 --> 0:23:44.690\nKeith Low\nHere you got 5 license, but during renewal only three are renewed.\n0:23:45.420 --> 0:23:45.620\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:23:46.240 --> 0:23:46.410\nChris DiPierro\nYeah.\n0:23:45.560 --> 0:23:53.40\nKeith Low\nThe other two are drop, so we don't know who to drop because I mean from platform point we we don't know who is that allocated to.\n0:23:54.50 --> 0:23:54.310\nChris DiPierro\nYeah.\n0:23:54.320 --> 0:23:54.810\nChris DiPierro\nWhat 11?\n0:23:55.600 --> 0:23:55.870\nStephanie Jones\nSo.\n0:23:54.820 --> 0:23:56.580\nChris DiPierro\nHope this is a bit of an outlier situation.\n0:23:56.590 --> 0:23:57.880\nChris DiPierro\nFirst off, just to be clear, right?\n0:23:57.880 --> 0:23:58.940\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:24:2.260 --> 0:24:2.600\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:23:57.890 --> 0:24:7.120\nChris DiPierro\nLike, presumably, a company is renewing the correct number of licenses, but like maybe somebody didn't count things correct.\n0:24:7.730 --> 0:24:10.360\nChris DiPierro\nI think the the bigger situation is more like you know.\n0:24:7.840 --> 0:24:12.500\nStephanie Jones\nYeah, maybe they're like 1234.\n0:24:13.450 --> 0:24:13.990\nStephanie Jones\nYeah, go ahead.\n0:24:13.320 --> 0:24:18.800\nChris DiPierro\nWell, I think it's a I think it's more like, hey, I've got 10 audit licenses.\n0:24:22.430 --> 0:24:22.630\nStephanie Jones\nHello.\n0:24:19.150 --> 0:24:22.990\nChris DiPierro\nI am the person in charge of renewals, I say ohh, that's weird.\n0:24:29.430 --> 0:24:29.770\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:24:23.60 --> 0:24:33.610\nChris DiPierro\nI think we only have 8 auditors, so I renew 8, but it turns out Stephanie sometimes uses an all that license because the person doing the renewal all didn't really realize even though you're not truly an auditor.\n0:24:34.800 --> 0:24:35.60\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:24:33.620 --> 0:24:42.470\nChris DiPierro\nBut sometimes I use it anyway, so not that anybody left the company legitimately, like deactivated, but we just find ourselves in a kind of weird situation like that.\n0:24:42.520 --> 0:24:44.410\nChris DiPierro\nLike I said, I hope this is a bit of an outlier.\n0:24:45.260 --> 0:24:45.440\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:24:44.420 --> 0:24:50.330\nChris DiPierro\nNot like of a thing that happens particularly frequently, but then the, but I think you do still have to.\n0:24:53.610 --> 0:24:54.200\nStephanie Jones\nWhat would?\n0:24:51.330 --> 0:24:55.310\nChris DiPierro\nUh, figure out what the behavior is when, when that happens so.\n0:24:54.240 --> 0:24:56.70\nStephanie Jones\nYeah. Umm.\n0:24:57.680 --> 0:24:59.890\nChris DiPierro\nI I guess you know to offer an opinion.\n0:25:5.690 --> 0:25:5.870\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:25:0.340 --> 0:25:6.710\nChris DiPierro\nI am of the note because, as you said, Keith, you don't really know which licenses you would drop in that spot.\n0:25:12.110 --> 0:25:12.490\nKeith Low\nUmm.\n0:25:12.690 --> 0:25:12.870\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:25:6.820 --> 0:25:13.470\nChris DiPierro\nI'm of the opinion of like, be very aggressive on notifications than in in.\n0:25:13.480 --> 0:25:22.750\nChris DiPierro\nIn that spot, you know again obviously to the admin of the tenant, but in the case that they're not paying attention, I think we would actually notify the other users as well.\n0:25:22.760 --> 0:25:31.270\nChris DiPierro\nSo when Josh logs in and he sees hey, you only have 8 licenses, there's 1010 auditors here.\n0:25:31.400 --> 0:25:32.510\nChris DiPierro\nDo something about it.\n0:25:32.580 --> 0:25:36.290\nChris DiPierro\nMaybe he contacts the tenant admin at that point and says, hey, what's going on?\n0:25:39.630 --> 0:25:39.840\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:25:36.300 --> 0:25:42.500\nChris DiPierro\nDo you remember that Stephanie also needs this license to uh, but also again backside?\n0:25:42.610 --> 0:25:46.840\nChris DiPierro\nMake sure our AR is getting you know notifications of this too, right?\n0:25:46.850 --> 0:25:50.280\nChris DiPierro\nLike it's the kind of thing that they should absolutely know about, right, you know?\n0:25:52.30 --> 0:26:3.80\nChris DiPierro\nAnd and and really what we're we're hoping happens is either they buy two more licenses to, you know, fix the problem or their tenant admin comes in and deep provisions, the two people who no longer need it.\n0:26:14.420 --> 0:26:14.650\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:26:3.90 --> 0:26:14.780\nChris DiPierro\nRight, like both of those solve are the sole from the customer's perspective, but we just wanna be noisy about when customers are in this state.\n0:26:19.50 --> 0:26:19.440\nStephanie Jones\nHey.\n0:26:14.790 --> 0:26:22.150\nChris DiPierro\nEssentially, I think I think would be my preference rather than trying to automatically figure out who you would deprovision or something like that.\n0:26:22.160 --> 0:26:27.70\nChris DiPierro\nSo you could get if you went down that route, you could try to get very fancy about it.\n0:26:27.80 --> 0:26:28.710\nChris DiPierro\nYou we only have 8.\n0:26:28.760 --> 0:26:29.950\nChris DiPierro\nThere's 10 deployed.\n0:26:29.960 --> 0:26:38.250\nChris DiPierro\nWell, you see who logged in most the longest ago and dropped them or something like that, but no rule that we're gonna come up with is gonna be make everybody happy.\n0:26:45.250 --> 0:26:45.710\nStephanie Jones\nI like that.\n0:26:38.260 --> 0:26:46.260\nChris DiPierro\nSo I think it really just comes down to let's just start being very notification noisy in in this hopefully rare situation.\n0:26:47.480 --> 0:26:57.280\nKeith Low\nUmm, OK uh, I think one more is what happened when user is unlinked permanently from all the instances.\n0:26:57.540 --> 0:27:2.670\nKeith Low\nI mean we we discussed this before, if if it's unlinked from one instances one, one or two instances.\n0:27:4.880 --> 0:27:6.790\nKeith Low\nThis license should be remain still remain there.\n0:27:7.400 --> 0:27:7.620\nChris DiPierro\nHmm.\n0:27:7.220 --> 0:27:9.610\nKeith Low\nBut let's say you got UH-4 instances.\n0:27:9.860 --> 0:27:14.70\nKeith Low\nThis person is unlinked 4 from all I think logically.\n0:27:14.120 --> 0:27:23.80\nKeith Low\nUh, the license should be free so that, uh, it can be provisioned to another user, but then do you want to do that or you want to remain it in the in the 1st state?\n0:27:29.900 --> 0:27:30.320\nKeith Low\nStephanie.\n0:27:30.860 --> 0:27:32.240\nKeith Low\nYeah. Umm.\n0:27:37.600 --> 0:27:37.780\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:27:29.710 --> 0:27:38.40\nChris DiPierro\nPresumably, if a user's being unlinked from every instance, that probably that user is no longer with the company, right?\n0:27:38.560 --> 0:27:38.810\nJoshua Haseldine\nUmm.\n0:27:42.730 --> 0:27:42.980\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:27:38.50 --> 0:27:43.160\nChris DiPierro\nLike, that's probably the most probably the most likely scenario where it would be weird, in my opinion.\n0:27:43.350 --> 0:27:47.300\nChris DiPierro\nIt would be weird if we have 4 instances and then we unlink that person.\n0:27:47.310 --> 0:27:52.900\nChris DiPierro\nBut like we expect them to still somehow be participating in the use of the software, right?\n0:27:53.20 --> 0:27:59.450\nChris DiPierro\nLike, I mean, I guess it could be that they changed like jobs and come back later or something like that and we would need to link them.\n0:27:59.460 --> 0:28:1.230\nChris DiPierro\nAt which point we could just reprovision their license.\n0:28:6.290 --> 0:28:6.490\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:28:1.240 --> 0:28:7.540\nChris DiPierro\nBut yeah, I think if they become untethered from every instance, we would just put that back in the pool at that point and let it be reassigned.\n0:28:8.600 --> 0:28:8.800\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:28:8.520 --> 0:28:9.100\nKeith Low\nUmm yeah.\n0:28:12.970 --> 0:28:16.100\nChris DiPierro\nI guess the OK, I am gonna create one.\n0:28:16.110 --> 0:28:21.140\nChris DiPierro\nWeird, not weird scenario, but one accidental thing that could happen in there.\n0:28:21.150 --> 0:28:30.740\nChris DiPierro\nLet's just say I have 4 instances and the user is assigned to one of them and really all I'm trying to do is move them from instance 1 to instance 2.\n0:28:30.750 --> 0:28:42.30\nChris DiPierro\nBasically, I guess if I remove them from instance one and then I add them to instance 2, if at the time that I removed them from instance one, their license gets pulled and then I put them on the instance too.\n0:28:42.40 --> 0:28:47.500\nChris DiPierro\nNow I gotta put their license back and it might just be kind of a an annoyance from that perspective I suppose.\n0:28:47.510 --> 0:28:52.820\nChris DiPierro\nWhereas if I did it the other way, added them to instance 2 first and then remove them from instance one, I wouldn't have to do that.\n0:28:54.740 --> 0:28:55.920\nJoshua Haseldine\nHow likely is they use case?\n0:28:52.830 --> 0:28:57.90\nChris DiPierro\nBut like I don't know, I don't know.\n0:28:57.480 --> 0:28:58.380\nChris DiPierro\nYou tell me me.\n0:28:59.910 --> 0:29:4.690\nJoshua Haseldine\nLike I I can't see that being a a common use case enough for that to be like a.\n0:29:4.160 --> 0:29:13.210\nKeith Low\nI think we we we we can actually sell our time period for example you unlink from all the instances and we wait one one week or maybe two days.\n0:29:13.220 --> 0:29:14.570\nKeith Low\nI don't know before.\n0:29:15.900 --> 0:29:16.670\nJoshua Haseldine\nYeah, that's.\n0:29:13.420 --> 0:29:23.150\nChris DiPierro\nAnd no, I don't think you want to do that, because I think I one of one of the one of you as an admin you might go and say boy I need to give Josh a license.\n0:29:23.160 --> 0:29:24.90\nChris DiPierro\nI don't have anymore.\n0:29:24.770 --> 0:29:24.950\nKeith Low\nUmm.\n0:29:24.200 --> 0:29:26.910\nChris DiPierro\nOhh, that's right, Stephanie no longer works for our company.\n0:29:26.920 --> 0:29:30.20\nChris DiPierro\nI should really just unlink it from all the instances and give him a license.\n0:29:30.30 --> 0:29:32.900\nChris DiPierro\nRight now you don't want time delay for that happening so.\n0:29:36.690 --> 0:29:49.180\nChris DiPierro\nI think I think it's OK to just immediately do it, but like I do think that is one small quirk that might come up if I happen to be moving a user from 1 instance to another and I remove them from everything and then add them, then I just got to know that I got to go fix their licensing situation.\n0:29:50.490 --> 0:29:50.630\nJoshua Haseldine\nYeah.\n0:29:52.180 --> 0:29:52.440\nKeith Low\nHmm.\n0:29:49.430 --> 0:29:54.170\nChris DiPierro\nBut as you said, Josh, that's probably a fairly unlikely use case anyway, so.\n0:30:1.380 --> 0:30:1.610\nChris DiPierro\nUmm.\n0:29:55.970 --> 0:30:6.960\nKeith Low\nOK, I think we for MVP, we can just choose this route first, OK, another very simple question is the we we have two license now, I mean two license type now one is 1 is audit.\n0:30:7.400 --> 0:30:9.910\nKeith Low\nDo you have any specific description for it?\n0:30:10.290 --> 0:30:14.650\nKeith Low\nAt the moment, I'm telling those guys audit is audit racist and that's about it to you.\n0:30:14.660 --> 0:30:16.660\nKeith Low\nOr do you want to be more descriptive about it?\n0:30:19.530 --> 0:30:21.550\nStephanie Jones\nWho to more descriptive to who?\n0:30:22.510 --> 0:30:29.80\nKeith Low\nUh, I mean when we because in provisioning services they they have a description of the license, the license type.\n0:30:29.490 --> 0:30:33.720\nKeith Low\nSo right now it's just name as audit and the other one is a risk.\n0:30:34.660 --> 0:30:38.230\nChris DiPierro\nDid this get actually Stephanie your chat message yesterday around Salesforce?\n0:30:38.240 --> 0:30:40.970\nChris DiPierro\nDo this already get defined somewhere in Salesforce?\n0:30:42.10 --> 0:30:42.340\nStephanie Jones\nI.\n0:30:40.980 --> 0:30:45.160\nChris DiPierro\nLike if they're a license object somewhere and Salesforce or.\n0:30:53.860 --> 0:30:54.80\nChris DiPierro\nOK.\n0:31:1.190 --> 0:31:1.350\nChris DiPierro\nYeah.\n0:30:45.670 --> 0:31:3.450\nStephanie Jones\nI have not gone out to look in Salesforce to see what, umm, the license types look like, but I just I know from talking to Carl he said that all the license information was added in Salesforce so I can find out more about that. But.\n0:31:3.870 --> 0:31:4.710\nChris DiPierro\nDo you have, uh, Keith?\n0:31:4.720 --> 0:31:6.740\nChris DiPierro\nDo you have Salesforce access or or not?\n0:31:6.630 --> 0:31:7.370\nKeith Low\nYeah, I don't know.\n0:31:7.680 --> 0:31:9.630\nChris DiPierro\nOK, I wonder if we might need to.\n0:31:8.860 --> 0:31:12.870\nKeith Low\nI think the rate has, I can ask him to check if it's three, yeah.\n0:31:11.910 --> 0:31:13.40\nChris DiPierro\nYeah, proxy.\n0:31:13.50 --> 0:31:15.600\nChris DiPierro\nI mean I have Salesforce access but I'm not quite sure where I need.\n0:31:15.610 --> 0:31:16.820\nChris DiPierro\nWhere to go to look for this?\n0:31:16.830 --> 0:31:18.550\nChris DiPierro\nTo be honest with you so.\n0:31:25.780 --> 0:31:26.570\nChris DiPierro\nAnd an account.\n0:31:17.20 --> 0:31:27.230\nStephanie Jones\nYeah, I mean, I don't right, I don't know if I do either cause normally if I'm using Salesforce I it's to like look up a customer and I don't know if that tells me what.\n0:31:27.520 --> 0:31:27.720\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:31:26.580 --> 0:31:28.490\nChris DiPierro\nYeah, look at an account or a contact or something.\n0:31:28.500 --> 0:31:29.20\nChris DiPierro\nYeah, exactly.\n0:31:29.50 --> 0:31:29.270\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:31:31.310 --> 0:31:33.390\nStephanie Jones\nOK, I can try and find that out.\n0:31:33.130 --> 0:31:34.160\nChris DiPierro\nAnyway, uh.\n0:31:34.210 --> 0:31:36.240\nChris DiPierro\nPoint being, Keith, this might already be defined.\n0:31:36.290 --> 0:31:38.180\nChris DiPierro\nUh is really what it comes down to.\n0:31:38.190 --> 0:31:40.600\nChris DiPierro\nYou might have that information somewhere else where so.\n0:31:46.410 --> 0:31:46.580\nChris DiPierro\nSure.\n0:31:43.390 --> 0:31:46.680\nKeith Low\nI I think we we can change it later when we we have the info.\n0:31:46.770 --> 0:31:47.960\nKeith Low\nI think these are minor thing.\n0:31:48.330 --> 0:31:57.820\nKeith Low\nI think the other question I had was the tenant admin, I think probably most of us agree tenant admin will not be counted as one license.\n0:31:59.110 --> 0:31:59.380\nChris DiPierro\nThat.\n0:31:57.950 --> 0:32:0.380\nKeith Low\nYou bought 10 tenant, admin is.\n0:32:0.430 --> 0:32:2.50\nKeith Low\nSo is something out of it.\n0:32:7.330 --> 0:32:7.610\nKeith Low\nHmm.\n0:32:1.600 --> 0:32:18.430\nChris DiPierro\nUnless, but just to be clear, unless they also want to be an auditor, you know I I think by I think by default when you provision a tenant you provision a tenant admin and they get to do whatever they want, but they don't get to go use the software unless they have a license that is corresponding to them.\n0:32:24.190 --> 0:32:24.340\nStephanie Jones\nYes.\n0:32:18.440 --> 0:32:24.500\nChris DiPierro\nIt's perfectly reasonable for a small company for Stephanie to be the tenant admin, but also to be an auditor, right?\n0:32:25.0 --> 0:32:25.260\nKeith Low\nUmm.\n0:32:24.510 --> 0:32:26.550\nChris DiPierro\nLike I'm kind of a small thing.\n0:32:27.300 --> 0:32:27.510\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:32:26.640 --> 0:32:34.200\nChris DiPierro\nSo in that case, I think they would have to assign themselves an audit license in order to to use the software, but they don't need.\n0:32:34.210 --> 0:32:42.240\nChris DiPierro\nBut if you got a bigger organization where they're truly an admin role and never gonna be an auditor, whatever, then yeah, you don't need to give them licenses for the individual products.\n0:32:42.250 --> 0:32:44.250\nChris DiPierro\nAt that point, they can still do the admin tasks.\n0:32:44.830 --> 0:32:45.10\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:32:48.910 --> 0:32:54.450\nKeith Low\nOK, I think my licensing question mostly answered uh.\n0:32:56.680 --> 0:32:56.990\nKeith Low\nTo.\n0:32:56.460 --> 0:32:58.690\nChris DiPierro\nProbably made it all more complicated, Keith, but you know.\n0:33:8.50 --> 0:33:8.230\nChris DiPierro\nUmm.\n0:33:1.400 --> 0:33:8.710\nKeith Low\nI think it's because during the discussion with the TPO, I think sometimes we brainstorm them that there are a lot, a lot of questions that that team came up.\n0:33:9.440 --> 0:33:14.130\nKeith Low\nBut then I always I have the idea that MVP we should make it as simple as possible.\n0:33:14.300 --> 0:33:15.410\nKeith Low\nTry not to complicate things.\n0:33:16.690 --> 0:33:17.880\nChris DiPierro\nYeah, there there is that.\n0:33:17.890 --> 0:33:18.280\nChris DiPierro\nRight.\n0:33:18.290 --> 0:33:18.620\nChris DiPierro\nSo.\n0:33:18.690 --> 0:33:40.960\nChris DiPierro\nSo I don't know how complex some of the things that we just said are, but you know, if there were places for, you know, release one that we wanted to get things out the door faster, a couple places where we said things are configurable, we could potentially make them fix time periods now, so long as they become configurable later, like we've said, I think notification periods were configurable and grace periods are configurable.\n0:33:47.750 --> 0:33:47.950\nKeith Low\nUmm.\n0:33:40.970 --> 0:33:52.280\nChris DiPierro\nBut like if we went out the door initially and said the notification is always like a two month, one month, one week kind of window and grace period was always 30 days, it's inspected probably be OK later on.\n0:33:52.290 --> 0:33:56.20\nChris DiPierro\nWe could probably add some more flexibility or around that, right?\n0:33:56.30 --> 0:34:12.200\nChris DiPierro\nSo I don't know, you know, this is a TPO on our side question potentially or dev team question like how complicated some of the configurability gets but you know you there are places that we could probably push to like a second release of licensing if we need to there so.\n0:34:10.840 --> 0:34:13.100\nKeith Low\nYeah. Yep.\n0:34:13.390 --> 0:34:13.590\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:34:15.40 --> 0:34:22.230\nKeith Low\nUh, I think the other thing is probably I asked before is is there any specific target for licensing to be ready?\n0:34:23.40 --> 0:34:23.530\nChris DiPierro\nTomorrow.\n0:34:22.660 --> 0:34:23.920\nKeith Low\nI think previously it was.\n0:34:26.990 --> 0:34:33.920\nKeith Low\nI think previously I think we discussed it was expected to be in R2, the audit and Risk Release 2.\n0:34:33.930 --> 0:34:35.850\nKeith Low\nSo that probably is in summer July.\n0:34:36.70 --> 0:34:38.170\nChris DiPierro\nActually, let me let let me ask a question about that.\n0:34:38.180 --> 0:34:42.170\nChris DiPierro\nIt sounded like the last conversation with naig yesterday, the day before.\n0:34:42.180 --> 0:34:49.330\nChris DiPierro\nWhatever was, it sounded like you guys are really on track very quickly to do follow on releases at this point, right?\n0:34:53.410 --> 0:34:53.700\nJoshua Haseldine\nI.\n0:34:49.380 --> 0:34:54.370\nChris DiPierro\nWe've heard some, I I I think I can't remember his you, Josh or somebody.\n0:34:56.840 --> 0:34:58.460\nJoshua Haseldine\nSo I said attachments is already.\n0:34:58.870 --> 0:34:59.180\nJoshua Haseldine\nYeah.\n0:34:54.380 --> 0:34:59.700\nChris DiPierro\nSomebody said like attachments already done and notifications are getting there and yeah.\n0:34:59.190 --> 0:35:4.950\nJoshua Haseldine\nSo I said attachments is already done, but everyone seems to have had this conversation with Nick about incremental releases, except me.\n0:35:5.570 --> 0:35:5.840\nChris DiPierro\nOK.\n0:35:6.330 --> 0:35:10.380\nJoshua Haseldine\nSo I I need to have that conversation with Nige.\n0:35:10.470 --> 0:35:14.360\nJoshua Haseldine\nI I'm having that today, but yeah, I've not had that conversation with him yet.\n0:35:14.420 --> 0:35:14.600\nChris DiPierro\nOK.\n0:35:15.40 --> 0:35:15.270\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:35:14.370 --> 0:35:19.550\nJoshua Haseldine\nTo go over that, I'm but yeah, that's that seems to be where we're heading towards.\n0:35:28.290 --> 0:35:28.510\nJoshua Haseldine\nUmm.\n0:35:20.440 --> 0:35:30.990\nChris DiPierro\nOK, I I think I I think maybe nidge is going down that path because of some OK hours that are being set about like cycle times and all that kind of stuff, right?\n0:35:31.0 --> 0:35:41.20\nChris DiPierro\nSo and and in any event, I guess the reason I ask is you know, Keith, you're saying our two, which is sounds more monolithic than what may be actually happening, right?\n0:35:41.30 --> 0:35:42.30\nChris DiPierro\nIt might be like there's.\n0:35:42.460 --> 0:35:47.990\nChris DiPierro\nWell, I guess they might not be called version 2, but it might be you know very quick 1.1 or 1.21 point 3 whatever.\n0:35:48.0 --> 0:35:50.320\nChris DiPierro\nAlong the way, it sounds sounds like. But anyway.\n0:35:50.610 --> 0:35:58.750\nChris DiPierro\nUmm yeah, I I mean correct me if I'm wrong, but like I kind of think that the licensing need is is clear and present basically.\n0:35:59.70 --> 0:36:0.480\nStephanie Jones\nIt is, yeah.\n0:36:0.750 --> 0:36:1.110\nKeith Low\nHmm.\n0:35:58.760 --> 0:36:1.500\nChris DiPierro\nSo as quickly as you can make it, make it available.\n0:36:1.510 --> 0:36:3.260\nChris DiPierro\nThis is the answer to that.\n0:36:3.280 --> 0:36:3.520\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:36:5.250 --> 0:36:7.50\nStephanie Jones\nUmm, I agree.\n0:36:16.440 --> 0:36:16.580\nChris DiPierro\nYeah.\n0:36:6.130 --> 0:36:19.800\nKeith Low\nI what we've TPO and we we try to get out a specific that as soon as yeah yeah at what we we we can provide uh let me see what other question I have umm.\n0:36:23.290 --> 0:36:25.990\nKeith Low\nI think there is an expectation of Farr storage.\n0:36:26.0 --> 0:36:27.720\nKeith Low\nUh to be ready, right?\n0:36:28.800 --> 0:36:29.40\nKeith Low\nWhat?\n0:36:29.50 --> 0:36:31.570\nKeith Low\nWhat is the expected requirement for file storage?\n0:36:32.830 --> 0:36:37.170\nKeith Low\nI think notification previously we discussed uh is similar to EHS.\n0:36:37.180 --> 0:36:38.240\nKeith Low\nSo I think that is fine.\n0:36:38.250 --> 0:36:39.200\nKeith Low\nUh, we have a scheduler.\n0:36:39.210 --> 0:36:40.290\nKeith Low\nThen we have a template.\n0:36:40.490 --> 0:36:44.790\nKeith Low\nThen we the team is working on on on the scheduler but for file storage.\n0:36:47.110 --> 0:36:47.320\nChris DiPierro\nI.\n0:36:47.0 --> 0:36:50.980\nKeith Low\nPresently the the capability is a single Farr outlook single file download.\n0:36:55.160 --> 0:37:2.630\nChris DiPierro\nYeah, it's my impression that ARC is integrating right now with file storage for the purpose of attachment, but I think what you're asking is what?\n0:37:4.220 --> 0:37:4.420\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:37:2.680 --> 0:37:6.430\nChris DiPierro\nWhat enhancements right to file storage are expected.\n0:37:6.520 --> 0:37:9.750\nChris DiPierro\nI recall conversations probably going back a year ago that.\n0:37:11.890 --> 0:37:12.620\nChris DiPierro\nThat probably.\n0:37:23.200 --> 0:37:23.360\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:37:12.630 --> 0:37:25.380\nChris DiPierro\nStephanie, I'm guessing that you or maybe David or somebody had some expectations of other things like you said, Keith, like multiple uploads, I can't remember, sorry off the top my head.\n0:37:32.350 --> 0:37:32.510\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:37:25.390 --> 0:37:34.530\nChris DiPierro\nI can't remember the other things, but maybe there were some limitation like being able to impose limits or something like that, but I don't quite remember where all that landed that.\n0:37:34.220 --> 0:37:37.120\nStephanie Jones\nYeah, I I'd have to dig that back out.\n0:37:37.830 --> 0:37:37.940\nChris DiPierro\nYeah.\n0:37:38.260 --> 0:37:43.710\nKeith Low\nI think the discussion was on the the egress and ingress.\n0:37:43.940 --> 0:37:47.710\nKeith Low\nHow much upload how much download that tied to the license itself?\n0:37:48.530 --> 0:37:48.680\nChris DiPierro\nYeah.\n0:37:52.190 --> 0:37:52.940\nChris DiPierro\nCan we say no to that?\n0:37:47.830 --> 0:37:54.480\nKeith Low\nI'm not sure how it still considering that and a folder with the files upload.\n0:37:54.910 --> 0:37:57.300\nKeith Low\nI think those those are capability which we do not have.\n0:38:4.690 --> 0:38:4.930\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:38:4.250 --> 0:38:4.990\nChris DiPierro\nYes, that's right.\n0:37:57.310 --> 0:38:6.320\nKeith Low\nI I think I I can't remember when we discussed this folder that contains file inside and upload it, we can't do that at the moment and so yeah.\n0:38:6.390 --> 0:38:8.490\nKeith Low\nSo right now it's only single file load single file download.\n0:38:17.170 --> 0:38:17.690\nJoshua Haseldine\nNice to have.\n0:38:10.600 --> 0:38:19.930\nChris DiPierro\nYeah, I think there was a requirement requirement or hopeful requirement how do you how do you how do you term requirements that are that that are yeah nice to have there you go.\n0:38:21.440 --> 0:38:21.680\nVincent Oon\nUmm.\n0:38:32.810 --> 0:38:32.990\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:38:20.150 --> 0:38:35.820\nChris DiPierro\nUh to to your point about folder upload, I think that I recall seeing something about like uploading the zip file basically, but then we unzip that somewhere along the line and like treat everything in that as its own set of attachments or even folder structure underneath that, right?\n0:38:35.830 --> 0:38:39.860\nChris DiPierro\nSo I seem to recall something around that that would be interesting to revisit.\n0:38:40.390 --> 0:38:47.80\nChris DiPierro\nI would like to suggest that we not impose limitations, license side limitations on file stuff.\n0:38:47.90 --> 0:38:48.100\nChris DiPierro\nI feel like get.\n0:38:48.670 --> 0:38:57.280\nChris DiPierro\nI think the work I think the reasoning behind that was we were worried that we might have some tenants that use ridiculous amounts of storage or I guess bandwidth potentially.\n0:38:58.500 --> 0:39:20.580\nChris DiPierro\nI think the reason this is a bit of a pain is all of a sudden you start to create a licensing file storage interaction that doesn't necessarily otherwise need to be there because like you know, for all of the questions we just asked about licensing, you kind of have a whole new set of questions about licensing like I'm an auditor and I wanna upload this file.\n0:39:20.740 --> 0:39:27.610\nChris DiPierro\nBut somehow my Macs storage my bandwidth whatever it is that we're living on, the license is all of a sudden exceeded.\n0:39:28.840 --> 0:39:31.950\nChris DiPierro\nNo, we've got a weird situation where they audit.\n0:39:31.960 --> 0:39:34.0\nChris DiPierro\nThey're like, can't do their job, right, I think.\n0:39:36.20 --> 0:39:45.310\nChris DiPierro\nIt's in my opinion it's much more important for us to be able to report, you know, by tenant, by product, I suppose, how much like file storage is in use.\n0:39:45.870 --> 0:39:53.880\nChris DiPierro\nUh, this might give us the ability to do things like charge for excessive usage in in the future or something like that.\n0:39:53.890 --> 0:39:55.130\nChris DiPierro\nLike we could, you know, it.\n0:39:55.140 --> 0:40:0.970\nChris DiPierro\nIt'd be really nice if an account like I don't know how we do this exactly, but an account Rep could like just see a report of saying.\n0:40:1.390 --> 0:40:1.590\nKeith Low\nUmm.\n0:40:0.980 --> 0:40:2.430\nChris DiPierro\nHere's the usage of.\n0:40:3.90 --> 0:40:3.370\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:40:2.900 --> 0:40:5.870\nChris DiPierro\nWell, not just the file storage, but pretty much everything here.\n0:40:5.880 --> 0:40:7.490\nChris DiPierro\nHere's everything about this tenant.\n0:40:7.500 --> 0:40:7.910\nChris DiPierro\nRight.\n0:40:7.970 --> 0:40:10.150\nChris DiPierro\nSo here's how many licenses they have.\n0:40:10.160 --> 0:40:12.450\nChris DiPierro\nHere's how many users actually log in over time.\n0:40:12.460 --> 0:40:15.540\nChris DiPierro\nHere's how much data they've used.\n0:40:15.910 --> 0:40:16.370\nChris DiPierro\nBandwidth.\n0:40:16.380 --> 0:40:18.160\nChris DiPierro\nProbably a little trickier, but you know.\n0:40:18.170 --> 0:40:30.860\nChris DiPierro\nAnd then, yeah, if you get somebody who's being ridiculously excessive, maybe the AR could come invent something and say, well, you know, you're heavy, use customer and you know, therefore we need to, I don't know, figure.\n0:40:30.870 --> 0:40:35.600\nChris DiPierro\nHowever, they might choose to monetize something, but my guess is that we're not gonna run into much of that.\n0:40:35.670 --> 0:40:38.680\nChris DiPierro\nLike I I feel like Stephanie.\n0:40:38.760 --> 0:40:48.660\nChris DiPierro\nKind of given us some metrics in pentana world, unlike what file storage usage kind of looks like and I don't recall being particularly shocked by any of that kind of kind of stuff, so.\n0:40:50.20 --> 0:40:50.220\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:40:52.20 --> 0:40:52.300\nKeith Low\nUmm.\n0:40:52.590 --> 0:40:53.660\nChris DiPierro\nAnyway, that's my opinion.\n0:40:53.670 --> 0:40:53.940\nChris DiPierro\nI would.\n0:40:53.950 --> 0:40:55.790\nChris DiPierro\nI would like to decouple all that.\n0:40:56.210 --> 0:40:59.480\nChris DiPierro\nThat's a complicated way of saying I would like to decouple licensing from filestorage.\n0:40:59.490 --> 0:41:4.810\nChris DiPierro\nThat doesn't mean there are not other enhancements that we need to add to the file storage to accommodate use cases, though.\n0:41:8.360 --> 0:41:10.420\nVincent Oon\nWhat's the Pablo file size limit?\n0:41:10.430 --> 0:41:12.380\nVincent Oon\nCurrently fault.\n0:41:12.480 --> 0:41:12.810\nChris DiPierro\nOK.\n0:41:12.820 --> 0:41:13.150\nChris DiPierro\nMaybe.\n0:41:12.390 --> 0:41:13.310\nVincent Oon\nWhy we single file?\n0:41:13.160 --> 0:41:13.730\nChris DiPierro\nMaybe we should.\n0:41:13.740 --> 0:41:16.790\nChris DiPierro\nMaybe we should have a single file size upload limit to be fair.\n0:41:16.490 --> 0:41:17.670\nVincent Oon\nSo there's no limit.\n0:41:17.770 --> 0:41:19.580\nVincent Oon\nCan can use the Upload 1 gig file.\n0:41:18.390 --> 0:41:23.430\nJoshua Haseldine\nDo now I'm sure we have a a limit on files, do we not?\n0:41:24.630 --> 0:41:27.30\nChris DiPierro\nI think there's something in place already, but I don't.\n0:41:26.350 --> 0:41:29.460\nJoshua Haseldine\nI'm sorry, I I think it's like 5050 gigs.\n0:41:29.470 --> 0:41:30.180\nJoshua Haseldine\nSeems a lot.\n0:41:30.470 --> 0:41:30.760\nKeith Low\nUh.\n0:41:30.370 --> 0:41:35.870\nJoshua Haseldine\nNow, I said it out loud, but I'm sure it's about that or five gig of something.\n0:41:34.700 --> 0:41:38.50\nKeith Low\nI need to search and I I think probably is 100 Meg or 500 Meg.\n0:41:38.300 --> 0:41:39.370\nKeith Low\nIt's not a 5.\n0:41:38.620 --> 0:41:39.950\nJoshua Haseldine\nI'm sure it's not that Low.\n0:41:40.100 --> 0:41:40.990\nJoshua Haseldine\nI'm sure it's not that Low.\n0:41:41.0 --> 0:41:41.850\nJoshua Haseldine\nI'm sure it's higher than that.\n0:41:44.770 --> 0:41:45.320\nKeith Low\nNot profile.\n0:41:45.0 --> 0:41:45.490\nJoshua Haseldine\nYes.\n0:41:42.650 --> 0:41:46.280\nChris DiPierro\nWell, I think we're saying per file here, not yeah.\n0:41:45.500 --> 0:41:48.100\nJoshua Haseldine\nYeah, it's definitely.\n0:41:48.120 --> 0:41:50.140\nJoshua Haseldine\nIt's definitely so high that I'm.\n0:41:52.70 --> 0:41:53.240\nJoshua Haseldine\nI would get it all, but it's not.\n0:41:53.250 --> 0:41:54.460\nJoshua Haseldine\nIt develops down in a minute.\n0:41:56.630 --> 0:41:57.390\nJoshua Haseldine\nYeah, I'm sure it's.\n0:41:56.480 --> 0:42:2.780\nVincent Oon\nIs there a limit on the file type like like a a PDF file only or a ZIP file can can they upload?\n0:42:3.440 --> 0:42:4.410\nJoshua Haseldine\nWe can upload a zip file.\n0:42:3.870 --> 0:42:8.930\nKeith Low\nOn I think executable EXE file is not not allowed.\n0:42:8.940 --> 0:42:10.190\nKeith Low\nBut besides that, everything is OK.\n0:42:10.840 --> 0:42:11.0\nJoshua Haseldine\nYeah.\n0:42:10.880 --> 0:42:13.610\nChris DiPierro\nYeah, I think there's a I think there's a black blister.\n0:42:15.140 --> 0:42:15.360\nJoshua Haseldine\nYep.\n0:42:13.620 --> 0:42:16.880\nChris DiPierro\nReddy, basically on based on file type, yeah.\n0:42:24.80 --> 0:42:26.340\nKeith Low\nOK, I think the conclusion is for file storage.\n0:42:26.560 --> 0:42:29.290\nKeith Low\nUh, Ed.\n0:42:29.380 --> 0:42:29.860\nKeith Low\nSecond phase.\n0:42:31.40 --> 0:42:31.950\nKeith Low\nUh, it's not.\n0:42:31.960 --> 0:42:32.490\nKeith Low\nI didn't know.\n0:42:32.500 --> 0:42:33.710\nKeith Low\nI think so.\n0:42:33.720 --> 0:42:35.10\nKeith Low\nMaybe we can revisit that.\n0:42:35.240 --> 0:42:35.620\nChris DiPierro\nWell.\n0:42:35.160 --> 0:42:36.590\nKeith Low\nI can come up with some ideas.\n0:42:36.920 --> 0:42:38.500\nKeith Low\nWhat we probably wanted to do want to do.\n0:42:39.480 --> 0:42:41.310\nChris DiPierro\nYeah, I might phrase that slightly differently.\n0:42:43.250 --> 0:42:43.520\nChris DiPierro\nYeah.\n0:42:43.530 --> 0:42:44.140\nChris DiPierro\nSorry, good, Josh.\n0:42:43.400 --> 0:42:46.20\nJoshua Haseldine\nSorry, it is 5 gig, I've just double checked.\n0:42:45.890 --> 0:42:47.290\nKeith Low\nAh, OK, OK.\n0:42:46.240 --> 0:42:47.350\nChris DiPierro\nIf it. Yeah.\n0:42:47.490 --> 0:42:48.310\nVincent Oon\nThank you. OK.\n0:42:47.950 --> 0:42:48.310\nChris DiPierro\nYeah.\n0:42:48.320 --> 0:42:54.320\nChris DiPierro\nI I I think the answer to this one is maybe this is the take away to the art team.\n0:42:54.330 --> 0:43:5.930\nChris DiPierro\nBasically, to go look through, especially now since you've done some work with attachment, maybe come back to us and say, hey, here's the things that we nice to have or requirements to whatever they might be.\n0:43:6.390 --> 0:43:6.870\nChris DiPierro\nUh.\n0:43:7.210 --> 0:43:9.530\nChris DiPierro\nCome, come back to us and sort through that again.\n0:43:13.460 --> 0:43:15.140\nStephanie Jones\nYeah, I think that makes sense.\n0:43:9.540 --> 0:43:16.190\nChris DiPierro\nEven if there's stuff that's been articulated before, maybe just revisit those and say, yeah, if it's multi file upload or whatever, but.\n0:43:16.740 --> 0:43:28.310\nStephanie Jones\nYeah, if you could, I mean, I know we've thrown out some things here, But yeah, Keith, if you could pull together, you know what what you need then then we can get that to work on getting that to you.\n0:43:30.710 --> 0:43:48.380\nKeith Low\nI think at the moment the uh main singer upload single download, it seems to to fit into your requirement, at least for for your release one I think right now we are talking about probably in release 2 or or I don't know release 1.11 point two there could be like some announcement which you would like to have.\n0:43:51.810 --> 0:43:53.340\nChris DiPierro\nYeah, just formalize that.\n0:43:53.350 --> 0:43:56.660\nChris DiPierro\nAsk and and send it over to Josh.\n0:43:56.670 --> 0:43:57.970\nChris DiPierro\nYou wanna on that one?\n0:43:57.580 --> 0:43:59.430\nKeith Low\nUmm OK.\n0:43:59.410 --> 0:44:0.240\nJoshua Haseldine\nYeah, it's not in my way.\n0:44:2.260 --> 0:44:2.420\nChris DiPierro\nYeah.\n0:44:0.250 --> 0:44:3.580\nJoshua Haseldine\nI can run it past the team and we can uh.\n0:44:3.620 --> 0:44:8.120\nJoshua Haseldine\nSay well, like, it's like easy wins really.\n0:44:8.500 --> 0:44:8.760\nKeith Low\nUmm.\n0:44:8.170 --> 0:44:9.470\nJoshua Haseldine\nWith what I'm looking for here.\n0:44:10.140 --> 0:44:11.260\nJoshua Haseldine\nI'm sorry, yeah.\n0:44:12.660 --> 0:44:13.750\nChris DiPierro\nWe're all looking for easy wins.\n0:44:14.230 --> 0:44:14.470\nJoshua Haseldine\nYeah.\n0:44:14.480 --> 0:44:15.0\nJoshua Haseldine\nTell me about it.\n0:44:16.170 --> 0:44:27.280\nStephanie Jones\nI did regarding the licensing, I did reach out to Sherry and just while we were talking here and she said that I asked about if it's within audit or within risk.\n0:44:27.290 --> 0:44:37.440\nStephanie Jones\nIf your whole department, your whole license, your entire number of licenses are renewing on January 1 and then April one, you decide to, yes, we need another license.\n0:44:37.690 --> 0:44:40.460\nStephanie Jones\nSo that additional license would be prorated.\n0:44:41.580 --> 0:44:41.750\nChris DiPierro\nOK.\n0:44:42.500 --> 0:44:42.790\nKeith Low\nHmm.\n0:44:45.890 --> 0:44:47.160\nChris DiPierro\nWould have the same experience, yeah.\n0:44:40.470 --> 0:44:49.540\nStephanie Jones\nSo for the rest of the time so everyone within audit and within risk would, it would adhere to the same renewal date.\n0:44:49.550 --> 0:44:50.460\nStephanie Jones\nSo that's good.\n0:44:50.780 --> 0:44:53.740\nStephanie Jones\nAnd then I asked about what about audit and risk?\n0:44:53.750 --> 0:45:1.490\nStephanie Jones\nAnd she said that she would also look to a pro rata umm addition for that.\n0:45:2.520 --> 0:45:2.720\nChris DiPierro\nOK.\n0:45:1.500 --> 0:45:4.730\nStephanie Jones\nSo then when renewal comes around that they would be renewed together.\n0:45:3.370 --> 0:45:5.470\nKeith Low\nHmm, OK.\n0:45:4.740 --> 0:45:8.330\nStephanie Jones\nSo if audit started 1st and then risk, maybe you know.\n0:45:8.420 --> 0:45:10.90\nStephanie Jones\nYeah, that they would try to prorate that.\n0:45:10.620 --> 0:45:11.380\nChris DiPierro\nOK. Awesome.\n0:45:11.950 --> 0:45:12.200\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:45:10.100 --> 0:45:14.20\nStephanie Jones\nSo I think that would fit in that would that's the ideal scenario.\n0:45:12.980 --> 0:45:15.850\nChris DiPierro\nThat makes it but, but that definitely makes our lives easier.\n0:45:16.320 --> 0:45:16.490\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:45:15.860 --> 0:45:17.340\nChris DiPierro\nProbably that's good.\n0:45:17.470 --> 0:45:32.180\nStephanie Jones\nAnd then Carl said, Umm, I don't think he exactly knows what you mean by license type description, Keith and I mean all let me share, let me just share my screen here for a second.\n0:45:32.510 --> 0:45:33.550\nStephanie Jones\nSo I just sent.\n0:45:36.290 --> 0:45:47.570\nStephanie Jones\nI just sent Carl, you know, like is there a license type description and he he said that yes, like the here are the license types set U but I don't think this is what you were asking for Keith.\n0:45:48.460 --> 0:45:51.530\nStephanie Jones\nSo but I don't know what to ask him for you.\n0:45:56.490 --> 0:45:57.660\nKeith Low\nLike for example over here.\n0:45:57.670 --> 0:45:58.480\nKeith Low\nYeah, I didn't.\n0:45:58.490 --> 0:45:59.360\nKeith Low\nInternal audit.\n0:45:59.370 --> 0:46:1.900\nKeith Low\nNew edition is that the name of this?\n0:46:1.910 --> 0:46:3.610\nKeith Low\nI mean, this is the description I can see.\n0:46:4.650 --> 0:46:6.490\nKeith Low\nI didn't risk management new edition.\n0:46:7.90 --> 0:46:7.490\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:46:7.500 --> 0:46:11.440\nStephanie Jones\nThe reason that we have new addition in there is is to simply.\n0:46:16.930 --> 0:46:17.380\nChris DiPierro\nPENTANA.\n0:46:17.210 --> 0:46:17.430\nKeith Low\nUmm.\n0:46:14.300 --> 0:46:21.220\nStephanie Jones\nIdentify that this is not pentana risk or pentana audit pentana MK so we.\n0:46:21.230 --> 0:46:22.100\nStephanie Jones\nSo that's the word.\n0:46:26.720 --> 0:46:27.70\nKeith Low\nUmm.\n0:46:32.140 --> 0:46:32.420\nKeith Low\nOK.\n0:46:22.110 --> 0:46:33.910\nStephanie Jones\nThat's the wording that Claire has been using in some of the marketing materials, and so we've just kept, I mean we've adopted that and it's right that's that's more I think that's more.\n0:46:34.980 --> 0:46:35.770\nStephanie Jones\nI mean it's internal.\n0:46:35.780 --> 0:46:42.950\nStephanie Jones\nI guess I shouldn't say it's just internal because what project Loki did was it just kind of confused a little bit of the naming.\n0:46:43.280 --> 0:46:45.80\nStephanie Jones\nSo addition is the word.\n0:46:41.260 --> 0:46:48.330\nChris DiPierro\nI yeah, I think we're probably looking for an external description, right and here.\n0:46:48.340 --> 0:46:51.170\nChris DiPierro\nHere, here's my belief of why we need this.\n0:46:52.90 --> 0:46:57.380\nChris DiPierro\nUltimately, the tenant admin is gonna see have the ability to assign licenses to users.\n0:46:57.390 --> 0:47:1.490\nChris DiPierro\nWe want it to be very clear to that tenant admin what they're actually assigning, right?\n0:47:10.510 --> 0:47:10.750\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:47:12.910 --> 0:47:13.110\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:47:3.780 --> 0:47:17.970\nChris DiPierro\nWe maybe it's as simple as just saying, you know, ideas and internal audit license idea, Gen Risk Management license, maybe that's enough, but I maybe we need to have a bit of a friendlier description that goes with that is as well.\n0:47:17.980 --> 0:47:18.480\nChris DiPierro\nI don't know.\n0:47:18.520 --> 0:47:19.700\nChris DiPierro\nI don't know if we do or not, but.\n0:47:19.440 --> 0:47:19.890\nStephanie Jones\nFit.\n0:47:20.340 --> 0:47:24.220\nStephanie Jones\nI mean the only other option for audit and risk would be the business user.\n0:47:25.130 --> 0:47:25.370\nChris DiPierro\nUmm.\n0:47:31.240 --> 0:47:31.540\nChris DiPierro\nRight.\n0:47:25.280 --> 0:47:34.820\nStephanie Jones\nSo and you know, within audit, you can have the the audit license, the risk license or the business user license.\n0:47:33.730 --> 0:47:47.490\nChris DiPierro\nAnd business there so would would the typical tenant admin know what each of those are or you know like do we have to show them what those are I guess is kind of the question?\n0:47:48.790 --> 0:47:51.10\nStephanie Jones\nI would think they would know what those are.\n0:47:51.950 --> 0:47:52.190\nChris DiPierro\nRight.\n0:47:55.300 --> 0:47:56.90\nKeith Low\nUh, Stephanie.\n0:47:56.100 --> 0:47:57.750\nKeith Low\nSorry, you were mentioned business license.\n0:47:57.760 --> 0:47:59.230\nKeith Low\nIs that the type of a license type?\n0:47:59.580 --> 0:47:59.800\nChris DiPierro\nUmm.\n0:48:0.290 --> 0:48:0.450\nStephanie Jones\nYes.\n0:48:0.970 --> 0:48:1.760\nChris DiPierro\nYep Yep.\n0:48:2.740 --> 0:48:3.500\nKeith Low\nUh, OK.\n0:48:3.510 --> 0:48:6.330\nKeith Low\nUh, because I think previously we discussed there is an risk.\n0:48:6.580 --> 0:48:8.390\nKeith Low\nI mean, there is a risk, right?\n0:48:9.850 --> 0:48:10.100\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:48:11.890 --> 0:48:12.0\nChris DiPierro\nYeah.\n0:48:12.330 --> 0:48:12.540\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:48:9.400 --> 0:48:13.390\nKeith Low\nThere is another one is audit time, so I only told them we have two.\n0:48:13.440 --> 0:48:15.660\nKeith Low\nSo right now we have 1/3 type core business license.\n0:48:16.300 --> 0:48:16.930\nChris DiPierro\nYep.\n0:48:15.470 --> 0:48:17.100\nStephanie Jones\nWe have business user as well.\n0:48:18.100 --> 0:48:19.850\nChris DiPierro\nYeah, but it shouldn't matter, right?\n0:48:19.860 --> 0:48:21.400\nChris DiPierro\nLike from our perspective, we're we're.\n0:48:20.190 --> 0:48:21.840\nStephanie Jones\nSome may use, some may not.\n0:48:23.570 --> 0:48:24.560\nStephanie Jones\nSorry to cut you off.\n0:48:23.510 --> 0:48:25.540\nChris DiPierro\nFrom our perspective, Keith, no, that's OK.\n0:48:25.550 --> 0:48:28.760\nChris DiPierro\nFrom our perspective, we're we're agnostic about what the licenses are, right?\n0:48:28.770 --> 0:48:32.360\nChris DiPierro\nShouldn't matter to us if there's one or 100 different license types, right? Like.\n0:48:33.450 --> 0:48:41.250\nChris DiPierro\nYou know, but the at the tenants are provisioned with whatever it is kind of licenses that they have.\n0:48:41.260 --> 0:48:45.630\nChris DiPierro\nAnd as we've said, like what the meaning of those licenses are is up to the product, right?\n0:48:46.820 --> 0:48:46.990\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:48:45.640 --> 0:48:52.210\nChris DiPierro\nSo somebody has a business license versus an audit license or whatever we tell the product, that's what they've got.\n0:48:56.460 --> 0:48:56.640\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:48:52.460 --> 0:48:57.190\nChris DiPierro\nIt's up to them to make whatever decision on whatever functionality at that point, but shouldn't matter to us.\n0:48:57.200 --> 0:48:58.990\nChris DiPierro\nHow many licensed types there are at all?\n0:48:59.680 --> 0:49:0.750\nKeith Low\nYeah, you shouldn't matter.\n0:49:0.760 --> 0:49:6.570\nKeith Low\nBut because provisioning the way they design it, I need to inform them like for example they have two.\n0:49:6.620 --> 0:49:9.670\nKeith Low\nOK, right now I mean in this discussion, we will have three.\n0:49:9.880 --> 0:49:12.400\nKeith Low\nSo one is a I I'm talking about the three type of license.\n0:49:11.600 --> 0:49:15.630\nChris DiPierro\nBut what we should be but we should should be telling them there could be end type of licenses.\n0:49:15.640 --> 0:49:16.330\nChris DiPierro\nIt doesn't matter.\n0:49:26.210 --> 0:49:26.650\nKeith Low\nUmm.\n0:49:31.510 --> 0:49:31.690\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:49:37.750 --> 0:49:37.930\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:49:42.40 --> 0:49:42.390\nKeith Low\nYeah, yeah.\n0:49:16.380 --> 0:49:45.80\nChris DiPierro\nLike it it we there, there should really be nothing in our we should not be imposing any sort of limitation on how many licensed types there are, period like you know, once this expanded beyond ARC right there could be 10s of different licenses types clearly right or even our in our Stephanie talked about other feature license types as well, right, so so so yeah I mean boy we need to not have any kind of dependency like that somewhere in there so.\n0:49:45.500 --> 0:49:46.190\nKeith Low\nYeah, I understand.\n0:49:46.400 --> 0:49:53.490\nKeith Low\nUh, so this business license is is covered IDEAGEN risk and audit business license?\n0:49:55.880 --> 0:49:57.720\nKeith Low\nI mean, I'm just thinking about the description.\n0:49:57.730 --> 0:49:57.930\nKeith Low\nWhy?\n0:49:58.0 --> 0:49:59.160\nKeith Low\nWhy am I supposed to call it?\n0:50:0.220 --> 0:50:0.650\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:50:0.670 --> 0:50:3.50\nStephanie Jones\nI mean, let me let me share this again.\n0:50:3.60 --> 0:50:4.490\nStephanie Jones\nSo this is something else.\n0:50:4.500 --> 0:50:7.50\nStephanie Jones\nThis is actually the calculator that's been approved.\n0:50:7.60 --> 0:50:10.740\nStephanie Jones\nThis is the pricing calculator, so I'm just seeing what so.\n0:50:11.30 --> 0:50:13.870\nStephanie Jones\nUmm yeah.\n0:50:10.810 --> 0:50:14.190\nKeith Low\nOK, business user? Umm.\n0:50:13.920 --> 0:50:17.830\nStephanie Jones\nSo right in the pricing calculator, I selected audit.\n0:50:20.140 --> 0:50:20.360\nChris DiPierro\nHmm.\n0:50:17.840 --> 0:50:22.380\nStephanie Jones\nSo if someone purchases audit, then you know there's a drop down.\n0:50:24.310 --> 0:50:24.600\nChris DiPierro\nYeah.\n0:50:22.390 --> 0:50:26.240\nStephanie Jones\nSo they either say am I purchasing audit risk or both?\n0:50:26.880 --> 0:50:27.100\nChris DiPierro\nUmm.\n0:50:26.770 --> 0:50:31.340\nStephanie Jones\nSo for if audit is selected then you know how many named users, just named users.\n0:50:33.600 --> 0:50:33.810\nChris DiPierro\nUmm.\n0:50:31.350 --> 0:50:37.130\nStephanie Jones\nDo you have those are your auditors and then do you use business users or not?\n0:50:37.390 --> 0:50:39.330\nStephanie Jones\nSo that's a yes or a no question.\n0:50:39.580 --> 0:50:40.210\nChris DiPierro\nInteresting.\n0:50:40.220 --> 0:50:45.160\nChris DiPierro\nSo it's not like a number of business users, it's just like effectively infinite.\n0:50:42.420 --> 0:50:47.10\nStephanie Jones\nIt's not a number, so the number of business use, what's that?\n0:50:47.700 --> 0:50:49.220\nChris DiPierro\nEffectively infinite as eventually.\n0:50:49.830 --> 0:50:50.580\nStephanie Jones\nInfinite.\n0:50:50.590 --> 0:50:55.940\nStephanie Jones\nSo if you and the price of that, if you're an, I mean I'll just plug it in here.\n0:50:56.220 --> 0:50:56.360\nChris DiPierro\nSure.\n0:50:56.40 --> 0:51:7.760\nStephanie Jones\nSo if you have like, I don't know if I can edit this, but if you have three then the cost and you say yes here it's going to give you a cost of what the business users are, OK.\n0:51:7.770 --> 0:51:18.920\nStephanie Jones\nSo if I have 3 auditors, the cost of my business, the cost to be able to have business users is 1800, I could have one business user or I could technically have 100 business users.\n0:51:19.850 --> 0:51:20.210\nChris DiPierro\nGotcha.\n0:51:29.590 --> 0:51:30.30\nChris DiPierro\nYou're paying.\n0:51:19.910 --> 0:51:30.840\nStephanie Jones\nIt's still going to be 1800 now if I have 100 auditors or however you know, 50, let's just do 50 now I'm paying 9800 again.\n0:51:32.220 --> 0:51:32.790\nKeith Low\nUmm.\n0:51:30.40 --> 0:51:33.260\nChris DiPierro\nYou're paying more for it, but it's still not limited on number.\n0:51:32.220 --> 0:51:34.130\nStephanie Jones\nYeah, it's still unlimited.\n0:51:33.270 --> 0:51:34.380\nChris DiPierro\nYeah, that's a.\n0:51:34.140 --> 0:51:37.750\nStephanie Jones\nI could have one at 9800 or 1000 and 9800.\n0:51:38.200 --> 0:51:39.600\nChris DiPierro\nYeah, that's an interesting one, Keith.\n0:51:39.610 --> 0:51:40.330\nChris DiPierro\nWe do have to.\n0:51:44.960 --> 0:51:45.210\nKeith Low\nUh.\n0:51:40.390 --> 0:51:46.300\nChris DiPierro\nI I didn't realize that that's how business users or really any kind of users would be treated treated.\n0:51:46.240 --> 0:51:46.460\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:51:46.310 --> 0:51:58.630\nChris DiPierro\nBut but I think, but I think one of the things that we need to have on license type is does this impose a user limit or not and you know yeah if if the answer to no.\n0:51:59.550 --> 0:52:1.610\nChris DiPierro\nYeah, this is where it could get tricky.\n0:52:1.700 --> 0:52:2.100\nChris DiPierro\nYou might.\n0:52:2.110 --> 0:52:3.700\nChris DiPierro\nYou might cheat on this one.\n0:52:3.710 --> 0:52:8.190\nChris DiPierro\nThis this is a question to ask like the whoever's handling this a TPO level for us, Keith.\n0:52:21.530 --> 0:52:21.670\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:52:8.200 --> 0:52:24.100\nChris DiPierro\nBut one thing you might do is cheat a little bit, and if there's an unlimited number of users, like really just baking some ridiculously high number behind the scenes and say you know, hey, they have 10,000 of those users, that they could design or something like that, so.\n0:52:24.960 --> 0:52:26.530\nKeith Low\nSo the basically the business user.\n0:52:26.540 --> 0:52:27.900\nKeith Low\nIf I look at it is unlimited.\n0:52:32.80 --> 0:52:32.340\nChris DiPierro\nUmm.\n0:52:34.860 --> 0:52:35.60\nChris DiPierro\nYep.\n0:52:37.750 --> 0:52:38.270\nStephanie Jones\nUnlimited.\n0:52:29.310 --> 0:52:38.340\nKeith Low\nI mean the other name user is is straightforward you by 5 you have 510, you have 10 but the business user means unlimited and and that's what our Chris you are saying.\n0:52:38.350 --> 0:52:40.250\nKeith Low\nSo it we can actually put 999.\n0:52:39.200 --> 0:52:40.570\nChris DiPierro\nWell, what I'm what I'm saying.\n0:52:40.900 --> 0:52:41.170\nChris DiPierro\nWhat?\n0:52:41.180 --> 0:52:41.390\nChris DiPierro\nWhat?\n0:52:41.400 --> 0:52:41.690\nChris DiPierro\nWhat?\n0:52:40.530 --> 0:52:42.920\nStephanie Jones\nIt and some may not use it.\n0:52:41.700 --> 0:52:44.0\nChris DiPierro\nWhat I'm saying is right.\n0:52:44.280 --> 0:52:44.540\nChris DiPierro\nYeah.\n0:52:44.550 --> 0:52:45.960\nChris DiPierro\nYeah, some, some might not have it at all.\n0:52:46.870 --> 0:52:47.180\nKeith Low\nHmm.\n0:52:45.970 --> 0:52:57.30\nChris DiPierro\nThat's fine, but I'm what I'm saying is in in a license type right, like generically in a license type, we need to accommodate the situation where there might not be a user limitation at all.\n0:52:58.970 --> 0:52:59.210\nKeith Low\nHmm.\n0:53:1.370 --> 0:53:1.610\nKeith Low\nHmm.\n0:52:57.40 --> 0:53:2.880\nChris DiPierro\nBusiness user happens to be an instance of that, but we could probably see that else around in other products potentially.\n0:53:3.530 --> 0:53:9.180\nChris DiPierro\nSo either we actually have essentially what amounts to a Boolean.\n0:53:9.190 --> 0:53:9.890\nChris DiPierro\nYes, no.\n0:53:9.940 --> 0:53:11.0\nChris DiPierro\nIs this unlimited?\n0:53:17.350 --> 0:53:17.530\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:53:19.460 --> 0:53:19.760\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:53:11.250 --> 0:53:22.290\nChris DiPierro\nOr if for some reason that's hard, like I said, just like treating unlimited thing as some ridiculously large number of of users, I've seen that kind of behavior before, like when?\n0:53:22.890 --> 0:53:34.700\nChris DiPierro\nUh, when I when I've managed like Microsoft partnership kind of licenses in the past, there's some stuff that they give away free, but technically it has like a 9999 kind of limit, like that sort of thing.\n0:53:34.710 --> 0:53:38.390\nChris DiPierro\nAnd I'm guessing we could get away with something similar here in the grand scheme of things so.\n0:53:39.360 --> 0:53:39.970\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:53:41.30 --> 0:53:41.210\nKeith Low\nNo.\n0:53:49.320 --> 0:53:49.560\nChris DiPierro\nUmm.\n0:53:40.560 --> 0:53:54.900\nStephanie Jones\nAnd and the other thing I want to point out on this, umm, if you have you know, if you if you I showed you the audit risk is similar but if you if you are using both audit and risk there's not audit business users and risk business users.\n0:53:55.910 --> 0:53:56.840\nChris DiPierro\nJust business users.\n0:53:56.850 --> 0:53:57.310\nChris DiPierro\nYeah. OK.\n0:53:54.910 --> 0:53:58.180\nStephanie Jones\nIt's just business users, yeah, so.\n0:54:0.520 --> 0:54:2.570\nKeith Low\nUmm, a risk?\n0:54:0.880 --> 0:54:2.610\nStephanie Jones\nOK, OK.\n0:54:2.620 --> 0:54:9.820\nStephanie Jones\nSo I don't think we keep you need anymore from Carl at this point to talk more about the like licensed types.\n0:54:13.150 --> 0:54:13.330\nStephanie Jones\nOK.\n0:54:11.800 --> 0:54:15.0\nKeith Low\nNo, no, I mean this business usage is actually very near.\n0:54:15.10 --> 0:54:18.380\nKeith Low\nI'm just trying to understand risk business User means they have unlimited risk.\n0:54:20.980 --> 0:54:23.930\nStephanie Jones\nYeah, yeah, same right.\n0:54:19.630 --> 0:54:26.250\nKeith Low\nUh, it's not the the same for for internal audit.\n0:54:27.140 --> 0:54:27.280\nStephanie Jones\nYeah.\n0:54:26.640 --> 0:54:32.570\nKeith Low\nThen there is another category called risk and Audit Business user, which has both unlimited.\n0:54:36.310 --> 0:54:36.850\nChris DiPierro\nSay that again.\n0:54:35.140 --> 0:54:37.510\nStephanie Jones\nWell, the same thing applies for the.\n0:54:38.660 --> 0:54:43.270\nStephanie Jones\nIf someone wants to use the Enterprise edition, which is basically just audit and risk.\n0:54:45.660 --> 0:54:56.90\nStephanie Jones\nTogether at this point, then they would say how many auditors, how many risk users, and then again that same that same yes, no question.\n0:54:56.600 --> 0:54:56.780\nChris DiPierro\nYep.\n0:55:3.0 --> 0:55:4.780\nChris DiPierro\nSure, don't use that at all, yeah.\n0:54:57.100 --> 0:55:5.330\nStephanie Jones\nDo I want to have business users or not because we do have customers that say I don't my business users we are we don't have business users.\n0:55:8.640 --> 0:55:9.50\nChris DiPierro\nYeah.\n0:55:9.100 --> 0:55:9.730\nChris DiPierro\nSo, so.\n0:55:5.340 --> 0:55:10.280\nStephanie Jones\nWe don't use that, we just take care of that outside the software and so they would say no.\n0:55:9.740 --> 0:55:14.10\nChris DiPierro\nSo Keith, I think I, I think at the end of the day, there's three license types here, right.\n0:55:14.210 --> 0:55:14.490\nKeith Low\nHmm.\n0:55:14.80 --> 0:55:17.350\nChris DiPierro\nThere is audit users audit license type if you will.\n0:55:17.440 --> 0:55:21.150\nChris DiPierro\nThere's risk license type, and then there's business user license type.\n0:55:36.140 --> 0:55:36.360\nStephanie Jones\nUmm.\n0:55:21.330 --> 0:55:37.470\nChris DiPierro\nAny tenant can have provisioning of between one and three of those, depending on what it's gonna be in the any time that they have business users, there's just not a hard limit on the number of users that they can assign there.\n0:55:37.520 --> 0:55:39.890\nChris DiPierro\nThat's all we're saying that right?\n0:55:40.780 --> 0:55:40.990\nKeith Low\nUmm.\n0:55:39.910 --> 0:55:41.280\nStephanie Jones\nUmm. Yeah.\n0:55:41.290 --> 0:55:41.550\nStephanie Jones\nAnd then?\n0:55:40.340 --> 0:55:46.700\nChris DiPierro\nBut at the end of the day, there there are we there are always potentially up to three types in in what she has selected.\n0:55:46.710 --> 0:55:48.930\nChris DiPierro\nWhat's Stephanie has selected for now?\n0:55:48.990 --> 0:55:49.250\nChris DiPierro\nYeah.\n0:55:49.310 --> 0:55:50.920\nChris DiPierro\nFor now, yeah. Yep.\n0:55:54.970 --> 0:55:55.110\nChris DiPierro\nYeah.\n0:55:46.630 --> 0:55:58.380\nStephanie Jones\nToday, I think that could change so it goes back to what you were saying it should be in number because if we start to say now for audit, we need a we need standard and professional licenses.\n0:55:58.390 --> 0:56:2.530\nStephanie Jones\nWe could split, you know, the intention is to split those out as we add more functionality.\n0:56:3.280 --> 0:56:3.650\nChris DiPierro\nYeah.\n0:56:3.660 --> 0:56:3.970\nChris DiPierro\nYeah.\n0:56:11.190 --> 0:56:11.420\nKeith Low\nUmm.\n0:56:3.980 --> 0:56:12.170\nChris DiPierro\nYou know from from our perspective, Keith, what we're doing, we're defining essentially an object type called license type, license type.\n0:56:12.180 --> 0:56:13.870\nChris DiPierro\nLicense types have a name.\n0:56:22.120 --> 0:56:22.300\nKeith Low\nYeah.\n0:56:23.700 --> 0:56:23.950\nKeith Low\nHmm.\n0:56:14.140 --> 0:56:24.410\nChris DiPierro\nLicense types have potentially a limitation when provision, they should say have a potential Max number of users associated with it, but potentially they don't.\n0:56:24.420 --> 0:56:24.650\nChris DiPierro\nRight.\n0:56:25.20 --> 0:56:27.340\nKeith Low\nYep. Hmm.\n0:56:24.660 --> 0:56:30.10\nChris DiPierro\nIn the case of the business user, in this case, they wouldn't have that limitation associated with them.\n0:56:30.520 --> 0:56:32.30\nChris DiPierro\nThink that's all we're saying, so.\n0:56:32.0 --> 0:56:32.270\nKeith Low\nNo.\n0:56:32.320 --> 0:56:32.770\nKeith Low\nOK.\n0:56:32.780 --> 0:56:33.90\nKeith Low\nOK.\n0:56:33.100 --> 0:56:33.760\nKeith Low\nUnderstand. Yeah.\n0:56:34.500 --> 0:56:45.770\nChris DiPierro\nThe description I think still is potentially opens definitely like it's just a question of whether a tenant admin would need more information than just ideagen internal audit ideagen, risk management, ideagen business user.\n0:56:45.780 --> 0:56:50.570\nChris DiPierro\nEssentially, you know would would it be useful to give them a slightly friendlier description beyond that?\n0:56:59.520 --> 0:56:59.750\nKeith Low\nUmm.\n0:56:50.580 --> 0:56:59.910\nChris DiPierro\nBut I feel like we can have a placeholder in that Keith and determine if it's like useful in the future, but don't necessarily need to have that, you know, day one to.\n0:56:59.80 --> 0:57:1.220\nStephanie Jones\nI mean, are you just talking about something like this?\n0:57:4.20 --> 0:57:4.370\nChris DiPierro\nI think.\n0:57:1.230 --> 0:57:7.780\nStephanie Jones\nIs the license that are provisioned to auditors for their day-to-day audit use like that kind of a description?\n0:57:7.480 --> 0:57:7.790\nChris DiPierro\nHere.\n0:57:8.660 --> 0:57:9.640\nChris DiPierro\nYeah, in my opinion.\n0:57:9.650 --> 0:57:10.200\nChris DiPierro\nYeah, right.\n0:57:10.210 --> 0:57:15.290\nChris DiPierro\nLike as a tenant admin, if I'm assigning somebody an audit license, what what does it enable them to do?\n0:57:15.300 --> 0:57:20.40\nChris DiPierro\nBasically that kind of like, you know, a couple sentences maybe, right?\n0:57:20.50 --> 0:57:21.530\nChris DiPierro\nJust so that they're clear on that.\n0:57:21.40 --> 0:57:25.400\nStephanie Jones\nOK, got it.\n0:57:28.40 --> 0:57:29.250\nStephanie Jones\nOK, I'm going to have top off.\n0:57:30.540 --> 0:57:30.850\nKeith Low\nOK.\n0:57:30.760 --> 0:57:31.100\nStephanie Jones\nAlright.\n0:57:30.860 --> 0:57:31.880\nKeith Low\nI think yeah.\n0:57:30.770 --> 0:57:31.930\nChris DiPierro\nYeah, I got an 8:30 also, but.\n0:57:32.0 --> 0:57:32.520\nKeith Low\nThanks a lot.\n0:57:32.620 --> 0:57:33.520\nStephanie Jones\nThank you.\n0:57:33.900 --> 0:57:34.470\nKeith Low\nOK, thank you.\n0:57:34.430 --> 0:57:35.380\nChris DiPierro\nKeith, Keith.\n0:57:35.40 --> 0:57:35.450\nVincent Oon\nThank you.\n0:57:33.920 --> 0:57:35.900\nStephanie Jones\nThanks everyone and.\n0:57:35.390 --> 0:57:36.820\nChris DiPierro\nKeith, you're gonna you're keep.\n0:57:36.830 --> 0:57:39.180\nChris DiPierro\nYou're gonna write up basically a summary of all this.\n0:57:39.190 --> 0:57:40.280\nChris DiPierro\nIs that sound reasonable?\n0:57:41.60 --> 0:57:41.900\nKeith Low\nYeah, yeah, sure I can.\n0:57:41.700 --> 0:57:43.750\nChris DiPierro\nThe the the licensing stuff in particular.\n0:57:44.60 --> 0:57:44.270\nKeith Low\nUmm.\n0:57:44.640 --> 0:57:44.960\nStephanie Jones\nPerfect.\n0:57:44.20 --> 0:57:48.70\nChris DiPierro\nUh, Josh has got the to do of the IMF, the file storage stuff.\n0:57:50.930 --> 0:57:51.370\nStephanie Jones\nAll right.\n0:57:48.80 --> 0:57:51.830\nChris DiPierro\nSo, OK, awesome.\n0:57:50.970 --> 0:57:51.870\nKeith Low\nOK, thanks.

The discussion sought to understand the expected behavior upon the expiration of the licensing period.\n- **Expected Behavior on Expiration**: The conversation aimed to define what actions are expected when a license expires, including whether users would be locked out immediately or if there would be a grace period.\n- **Notifications for Expiring Licenses**: It was suggested to have a notification period (e.g., 30-60 days before expiration) to inform tenants about the upcoming license expiration.\n- **Grace Period Consideration**: Discussions around possibly offering a grace period after expiration were held, acknowledging that cutting off access immediately could be problematic, especially if users were in the middle of critical work.\n- **Granularity of Notifications**: Whether to notify only tenant admins or all users about expiring licenses was debated, leaning towards notifying tenant admins first then broader notifications as the expiration date approaches.\n- **Handling License Reductions**: Considerations for what actions to take if the actual number of licenses is reduced during renewal were discussed, focusing on how to decide which users lose access.\n- **Reporting and Monitoring**: The importance of reporting and monitoring license usage was highlighted to manage situations where licenses exceed the agreed number.\n\n#### File Storage Discussion Points:\n- **Current Capabilities**: Currently, the system supports single file upload and download. The discussion queried future enhancements including multiple files upload or possibly folder uploads.\n- **Business User Licensing**: It was clarified that a \"business user license\" would effectively offer unlimited users under that category, without a hard limit on the number of users assigned this license type.\n- **Pro-Rating Additional Licenses**: The process for adding additional licenses mid-term was discussed, with a pro-rating system in place to align all licenses to the same renewal date.\n- **License Type Description Need**: There was a debate on whether more descriptive names or explanations are required for license types to make it clear to tenant admins what they are assigning.\n- **Handling Unlimited Licenses**: For licenses considered unlimited or without a user count limit, a suggestion was made to either have a boolean flag indicating unlimited or to input a high number to simulate the effect.\n\n#### Action Items:\n- **Summary of Licensing Discussion**: Keith to summarize the licensing discussion points and decisions made for clarity and further action.\n- **File Storage Enhancement Proposals**: Josh to gather enhancement proposals for file storage capabilities based on the current and future needs as discussed, focusing on easy wins for the team.\n- **Clarification with Salesforce**: Stephanie to clarify with Salesforce concerning license type descriptions to ensure consistency and understanding across platforms.\n\nThe meeting aimed to address key concerns and future plans concerning licensing and file storage capabilities, with a focus on providing a clear, user-friendly system that meets the operational needs of tenants and admins."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write the points above again with the conclusion (if any)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Meeting Summary: Licensing Discussion and File Storage Requirements\n\n#### Licensing Discussion:\n- **Primary Focus**: The meeting aimed to clarify licensing questions, particularly regarding the actions when a license starts, expires, or is deactivated.\n- **Expected Behavior on Expiration**: Discussions led to the consensus that there should be a notification period (e.g., 30-60 days before expiration) for tenants, possibly followed by a grace period post-expiration to prevent immediate access cut-off.\n- **Notifications**: It was agreed that tenant admins should be the first to receive expiration notifications with broader notifications as the date nears, emphasizing the need for a clear notification strategy.\n- **Handling License Reductions**: The conversation pointed towards notifying admins and users about license reductions and allowing admins to reassign as necessary without automatically deciding which users lose access.\n- **Reporting and Monitoring**: Emphasized the importance of monitoring license usage to manage and report instances where the number of used licenses exceeds the allotted number.\n\n#### File Storage Discussion:\n- **Current Capabilities**: Acknowledged the system's support for single file upload/download with interest in exploring multiple file uploads or folder uploads.\n- **Business User Licensing**: Clarified that business user licenses would not have a hard user limit, effectively offering unlimited users under this category.\n- **Pro-Rating Additional Licenses**: Discussed a pro-rating system for additions to licenses within a term, ensuring all licenses align to the same renewal date.\n- **License Type Description**: It was considered to possibly add more descriptive explanations for license types to clarify for tenant admins their specific usages.\n- **Handling Unlimited Licenses**: Suggested handling unlimited licenses by possibly simulating a high number to indicate 'unlimited' or using a flag mechanism.\n\n#### Conclusions and Action Items:\n- **Licensing Summary**: Keith will write up a detailed summary of the licensing discussions and decisions for clarity and further reference.\n- **File Storage Enhancements**: Josh will compile a list of proposed enhancements for file storage capabilities focusing on immediate improvements that can be easily implemented.\n- **Salesforce Clarification**: Stephanie will seek further clarification regarding license type descriptions in Salesforce to ensure consistency across platforms.\n- **License Types**: It was concluded that the system could potentially handle three types of licenses (Audit, Risk, and Business User), with special considerations for the 'Business User' type, being treated as unlimited without a specific user count limit.\n\nThe meeting effectively addressed significant concerns about licensing and file storage, reaching consensus where possible and outlining clear action items to further refine the system\u2019s capabilities and user experience."}, {"role": "user", "content": "for license expiration, what is configurable?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "For license expiration, the discussion highlighted several aspects that could be configurable:\n\n1. **Notification Period**: The period before the license expiration date when notifications start to be sent out. It was discussed to potentially set a predetermined notification period (e.g., 30-60 days before expiration) to inform tenants and extend user communication as the expiration date approaches.\n\n2. **Grace Period**: The duration after the license expiration during which users can still access the application or service, allowing for uninterrupted service while renewal is processed. The meeting suggested the grace period could be configurable, but a common starting suggestion was a 30-day grace period.\n\n3. **Frequency and Target of Notifications**: Who receives the expiration notifications and how often they are sent. It was suggested that tenant admins should primarily receive these notifications, with the possibility of notifying all users as the expiration date nears. The frequency of these notifications (e.g., starting 60 days out with increasing frequency as the date approaches) could also be a configurable element.\n\n4. **Grace Period Actions**: What actions occur after the grace period expires without renewal. This could potentially include configurations for what happens to user access and data post-grace period.\n\nThe ability to configure these elements allows businesses to tailor the license expiration handling process to their operational needs and user expectations, improving the overall experience and reducing potential disruptions."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the enhancement for File Storage that was discussed?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The discussion on file storage enhancements focused on several key areas where improvements could be made to better accommodate the needs of the users and the application. The enhancements discussed were:\n\n1. **Multiple File Uploads**: The current system supports single file uploads, and there was interest in exploring the capability for users to upload multiple files at once or potentially entire folders, enhancing user efficiency and experience.\n\n2. **Handling of Zip Files**: There was a recollection of conversation around enabling users to upload zip files, where the system would then unzip these files and potentially treat the contents as separate attachments or maintain some form of folder structure within the application.\n\n3. **File Size and Type Limitations**: The current limit per file upload was confirmed to be 5 GB during the conversation. There was also a discussion about existing restrictions on certain file types (e.g., executable files) to maintain system security.\n\n4. **Unlimited Business User Licenses and File Storage**: It was clarified that the business user license might not impose a limit on the number of users, affecting how file storage usage could be perceived and managed under this license type.\n\n### Conclusions:\n- The focus was primarily on expanding the current capabilities to include more flexible and efficient file handling options such as multiple files/folder uploads and improved management of zip files.\n- It was suggested that while enhancements are being considered, the core team should formalize these asks and prioritize them based on the immediate needs and potential impact. Easy wins that improve the user experience significantly should be prioritized.\n- Further investigation and clarification on file size limits, file type restrictions, and the implications of potentially unlimited business user licenses on file storage were highlighted as necessary steps moving forward.\n\nThese enhancements aim to make file storage more versatile and user-friendly, accommodating a wider range of user needs and scenarios, especially in contexts requiring handling numerous documents or large datasets."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Extract points discussed on BUsiness User license."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The discussion on the Business User license during the meeting highlighted several key points and considerations regarding this specific type of license:\n\n1. **Unlimited Users**: It was clarified that a Business User license would effectively offer unlimited users under that category. There was no hard limit on the number of users that could be assigned this license type, making it flexible for accommodating varying sizes of user populations.\n\n2. **Price Structure**: The pricing for the Business User license would not be based on a per-user basis but rather as a flat fee potentially influenced by the number of audit or risk licenses within the tenant. This entails that whether a company has one or a thousand business users, the cost remains the same, contributing to simpler budgeting and forecasting.\n\n3. **License Offerings**: There are three distinct license types discussed: Audit User License, Risk User License, and Business User License. Each tenant could potentially provision any combination of these licenses based on their needs, with the Business User license offering unlimited access within its scope.\n\n4. **Flexibility in Usage**: The Business User license's unlimited nature provides significant flexibility for organizations to scale their user base without worrying about incremental licensing costs. This could be especially useful for large, fluctuating user bases or scenarios where broad access to certain functionalities is necessary without full audit or risk capabilities.\n\n5. **Potential Configurability**: The conversation touched upon the need for clear distinctions and potential configurability in how these licenses are managed and deployed, considering the unique characteristics of the Business User license.\n\n6. **Pro-Rating Additional Licenses**: Adding additional licenses mid-term, such as transitioning from Audit or Risk to include Business Users, would follow a pro-rated pricing model, aligning all licenses to the same renewal date. This approach ensures that licensing remains manageable and predictable even as business needs change.\n\n7. **Application**: The deployment and utilization of the Business User license might vary depending on the tenant's specific needs, but the system should be designed to accommodate this variability without imposing unnecessary limitations.\n\nThese points emphasize the Business User license's role in providing a flexible and scalable licensing option, catering to various organizational needs while simplifying management and cost considerations."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Notification\n     Period: Implement a notification system where tenant admin receives alerts\n     earlier (e.g., 60 days prior) than regular users (e.g., 2 weeks prior).\n     The frequency of these notifications should increase as the expiration\n     date approaches. \n\n\nInitial MVP will have fixed notification period and\nlater phase release will have configurable notifications period.\n\n\n Internal\n     Notifications: Ideagen's account managers and renewals department should\n     be informed about upcoming and expired licenses to facilitate renewals.\n Grace\n     Period: Allow for a grace period after expiration (e.g., 2 weeks),\n     enabling users temporary continued access. \n\n\nInitial MVP will have fixed grace period and later\nphase release will have configurable grace period.\n\n\n Hard\n     Lockout: After the grace period, users should be locked out with a clear\n     message explaining the situation and directing them to contact their admin\n     or Ideagen Account Manager.\n License\n     Reduction: When a tenant renews with fewer licenses, both tenant admin and\n     users should be notified, prompting the admin to deprovision unnecessary\n     users. \n User\n     Unlinking: If a user is unlinked from all instances, their license should\n     automatically return to the pool for reassignment.\n\n\n\n\nLicense Types:\n\n\n The\n     system should accommodate an unlimited number of license types, with\n     flexibility for future expansion beyond the current ARC\u2019s Audit, Risk, and\n     Business User types.\n Present\n     ARC License Type:\n \n  Audit\n  Risk\n  Business\n      User (unlimited users) - if a tenant has the Business User license, it\n      covers unlimited users for both Risk and Audit.\n \n Descriptions\n     of each license type for ARC as of now:\n \n  Ideagen\n      Internal Audit\n  Ideagen\n      Risk Management\n  Ideagen\n      Internal Audit and Risk Management (Business User)\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Storage:\n\nPossible future enhancements: \n\n\n Multiple\n     File Uploads: The ability to upload multiple files at once.\n Folder\n     Uploads: Directly uploading entire folders with their internal file\n     structure.\n Reporting:\n     Providing reports on file storage usage by tenant and product, allowing\n     for potential monetization of excessive usage in the future.\n\nBesides the above points, any other points I missed from the transcript?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your summary is comprehensive and captures the key points discussed regarding licensing, notifications, grace periods, license reduction, user unlinking, license types, and file storage enhancements.

"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. **The Slippery Swamp:** This type of pitch resembles a shallow swamp more than a rugby field. The mud is almost liquid in consistency, making footing extremely precarious. Playing on such a field, John might find himself sliding uncontrollably after a tackle, splattering mud not just vertically but also in wide arcs around him. The challenge here is maintaining balance and speed, as any sudden move can send a player skidding. For John, the uniform becomes a soaked canvas of brown, with splashes of mud reaching as far as his face and hair, a testament to every slide and fall.\n\n2. **The Sticky Quagmire:** On this pitch, the mud clings and clumps, having a thick, almost clay-like texture. Running feels like moving with weights attached to one's feet, as the mud grips onto boots and doesn't let go easily. Playing in these conditions is a battle against the ground as much as against the opposing team. For John, this means that by the end of the game, layers upon layers of this dense mud form a second skin, especially around the lower legs and knees. Efforts to kick or sprint leave behind a telltale spray pattern, marking every struggle against the quagmire's grasp.\n\n3. **The Puddly Field:** Inconsistent is the best word to describe this pitch. Some areas are solid, while others hide deceptive puddles masked under a thin crust of turf. Playing here requires a keen eye and adaptability. John might charge through what appears to be solid ground, only to find himself knee-deep in a cold, muddy bath the next second. Each puddle encounter adds a new layer of wet, dark mud, splashing upwards unpredictably, ensuring that no part of his uniform remains clean, from socks to the shirt, showing a patchwork of dark spots.\n\n4. **The Frozen Tundra:** Early in the game, the pitch is a firm, frozen expanse, but as the match progresses, the top layer thaws into a slippery, icy mud. Playing on such a field is a test of endurance and resilience. John and his teammates must adjust their tactics to combat the changing terrain. Falling in this kind of mud doesn't just cover you; it chills you to the bone. For John, falls are marked by smears of mud mixed with fragments of ice, clinging to his clothes and leaving behind cold, wet patches that are a mix of dirt and ice.\n\n5. **The Dustbowl:** After a long dry spell, what was once a field of mud turns into a fine, dusty layer sitting atop harder ground. This kind of pitch doesn't necessarily make playing dirty in the traditional sense but introduces its own challenges. During tackles and sprints, clouds of this fine dust are kicked up, coating players in a layer of dirt that sticks to sweat, turning into patches of mud. For John, playing on the Dustbowl means a gradual accumulation of grime, with the dust finding its way into every crevice and fold of the uniform, turning into streaks of mud as he sweats through the game."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user requested descriptions of different muddy pitch conditions and their effects on a player.

While there's not enough mud for players to sink into, it makes for a treacherously slick surface. John finds playing on this pitch exhilarating yet challenging as the ball skids unpredictably and players often slide further than they intend. The mud splashes up in thin sheets, creating patterns on his kit and leaving his legs and arms coated in a gritty, wet layer. Cleaning off involves wiping away a mix of fine silt and grass.\n\n2. **The Puddled Field:** After a night of heavy rain, the field John plays on is dotted with shallow puddles and soggy patches. The uneven distribution of water makes for a patchwork game experience. Running through these puddles sends sprays of muddy water up his sides and back, leaving his uniform a drip-painting of brown and green. In these conditions, John has to be mindful of his footing in puddles to avoid slipping, making the game an unpredictable dance.\n\n3. **The Thick Mud Bath:** In this scenario, the pitch is covered in a thick layer of viscous mud. This is heavy, energy-sapping terrain that tests endurance and strength. Every step is an effort as John's boots sink inches into the mire, and extracting them becomes a part of the game. Falls are common, leading to players becoming thoroughly coated in a dense layer of mud. The weight and clinginess of the mud on his uniform and skin alter his movements, turning the match into a slow-motion ballet.\n\n4. **The Dusty Mire:** Occurring after a light rain following a dry spell, this pitch is deceptive. The top layer of the soil turns to a fine, almost powdery mud while the ground beneath remains hard. Playing on this type of pitch leaves John with a dusting of mud that cakes dry on sweat, covering him in a gritty layer that gets everywhere, including his hair and even inside his mouth. The challenge here is less about slipping and more about the discomfort of gritty mud against the skin and the potential for the earth to cake in the deeper crevices of his gear.\n\n5. **The Rivulet Runner:** This unique pitch condition happens when there are small, stream-like paths of water running across certain areas of the field, creating channels of softer, muddier ground amidst firmer terrain. The erratic pattern requires constant adaptation, with John often finding himself suddenly stepping into a hidden, softer area that gives way, splashing mud up his legs and torso. Playing on such a pitch tests agility and balance, as well as awareness of the terrain. The mud here tends to be watery, leaving his kit soaked and stained in streaks wherever the mini-streams have caught him unawares.\n\nEach type of muddy pitch brings its own joys and challenges for John, affecting his play, how he gets dirty, and even the post-match clean-up rituals."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please describe a kind of pitch that might leave John covered in a thin patina of mostly-dry mud."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**The Crusty Carpet:** This pitch comes into existence after a dry spell follows a period of moderate rain, leaving the ground with a superficial layer of mud that quickly dries out in the sun, forming a thin crust over the grass. The earth beneath this crust remains relatively hard and compact, making the pitch largely stable but with a brittle top layer that breaks and cracks underfoot.\n\nAs John plays on this pitch, the action of running, tackling, and the occasional fall shatters this delicate crust, kicking up clouds of fine, powdery dust that settles on him. The sweat and minimal moisture on his skin and kit act as an adhesive, capturing the dust and leaving him covered in a thin, mostly-dry patina of earth. This kind of mud coverage is uniquely textured; it doesn't weigh down his movements like wetter mud but leaves a gritty feeling against his skin that can be felt with every movement.\n\nThe visual effect is quite striking, as John and his teammates look almost like statues, their features and the details of their kits softened and obscured by the dust. This creates an almost ethereal appearance as if the players are warriors from another time. The mostly-dry nature of this mud means that while it sticks to surfaces, it doesn't penetrate deeply into the fabric of John's uniform, making it easier to clean off with vigorous shaking or a brush. However, the fine dust has a way of finding its way into crevices and seams, leaving reminders of the game long after it's finished."}]}]}], "numConvs": 2}, {"summary": "The model provided clear, factual answers to technical and informational queries.

Their development stages, from being newborn pups to mature adults, are characterized by distinct physical changes that help them adapt to their environment and lifestyle as they grow.\n\n### Newborn Stage\n\nAt birth, red fox pups are quite small, weighing approximately 100 grams. They are born with a natal coat of short, soft, dark fur, which is primarily grayish-brown. This coloring helps them blend into the den's dark environment, serving as a form of camouflage against predators. Their eyes and ears are closed, rendering them deaf and blind, relying completely on their mother for warmth and nutrition. At this very early life stage, it's challenging to distinguish them from puppies of many other dog family species.\n\n### After a Few Weeks\n\nBy the time they are about two to three weeks old, the pups' eyes and ears open, and they grow more curious about their surroundings, even though they remain within the safety of the den. It is during this period that their fur begins to lighten, and the first hints of their eventual adult coloration start to emerge, though the changes are subtle initially.\n\n### Transition to Juvenile Stage\n\nA more dramatic transformation occurs at around four to six weeks. The pups' fur starts to change from the dark, grayish-brown natal coat to a more reddish coat, signaling their transition into the juvenile phase. They begin to venture outside the den under the watchful eyes of their parents, displaying increased activity and play. Their facial features also become more pronounced, and their tails start to show the characteristic white tip that red foxes are known for.\n\n### Growth Phase\n\nBetween two and four months of age, red fox pups continue to grow rapidly, both in size and in the development of their adult fur. Their red coat becomes brighter and more vibrant, with distinct patches of white, black, or silver, depending on their geographic location and genetic factors. Their legs lengthen, and their bodies become more proportional, resembling adult foxes but in a smaller size. This period is critical for learning hunting and survival skills from their parents.\n\n### Approaching Adulthood\n\nAs they approach their first year, red foxes have usually attained their full size and exhibit the full, rich coat of an adult. The vibrant red fur, white underbelly, black legs, and distinctive bushy tail with a white tip are all prominent. The transition from a juvenile to an adult is marked by the shedding of their juvenile coat and the growth of their permanent adult fur, which has a denser underfur to protect them against the cold. They are now fully equipped to live independently, though some may remain with their family group for a while longer.\n\n### Adult Stage\n\nAn adult red fox is a sight to behold, with its striking red fur, keen, alert eyes, and agile body. Adults maintain their appearance, with seasonal changes in fur thickness and minor variations in coloration, until they enter their senior years, which could be around 5 years in the wild. As they age further, signs of wear may become evident, such as graying fur, especially around the muzzle, and a less vibrant coat. However, these changes vary widely among individuals, and some maintain a sleek appearance well into old age.\n\nIn essence, the transformation of a red fox from a newborn to a full-grown adult is a journey of growth and adaptation, visually narrated through changes in their coat color, fur texture, and body size. Each stage prepares them for the challenges and opportunities of their environment, a testament to the resilience and adaptability of this widespread and beloved species."}]}]}, {"summary": "The user asked for guidance on addressing a reviewer's comment about excluded databases in a literature search.

Unlike terrestrial planets that have solid surfaces, gas giants are characterized by their thick atmospheres. When we talk about gas giants with clouds of carbons and pancarbons, we're delving into a fascinating aspect of planetary science that touches on chemistry, atmospheric science, and exoplanet research.\n\n## Carbon Chemistry in Gas Giant Atmospheres\n\nCarbons and pancarbons refer to carbon-based molecules and structures. In the context of gas giant atmospheres, this might include a wide variety of carbon compounds such as methane (CH\u2084), ethane (C\u2082H\u2086), acetylene (C\u2082H\u2082), and even complex organic molecules. The term \"pancarbons\" is not commonly used in scientific literature but may refer to a broad class of carbon-based compounds, potentially including novel forms of carbon like graphene or fullerenes (buckyballs) under certain conditions.\n\n## Formation of Carbon Clouds\n\nIn gas giant atmospheres, the temperature and pressure conditions can vary greatly with altitude. In colder outer layers, carbon-bearing molecules like methane can condense to form clouds. The exact composition of these clouds depends on the atmospheric temperature, pressure, and the chemical composition of the planet.\n\nOn Jupiter and Saturn in our Solar System, we observe clouds of ammonia and water ice, but at much higher temperatures and pressures, deeper layers might contain clouds made from compounds like hydrogen sulfide or even water, though not carbon. In contrast, for a gas giant with a significantly higher proportion of carbon to oxygen, more exotic carbon-rich clouds could form. For such a \"carbon super-rich\" gas giant, the atmosphere might be thick with clouds composed of soot, complex organic molecules, or even forms of graphite.\n\n## Exoplanetary Implications\n\nThe study of carbons and pancarbons in gas giant atmospheres is especially relevant in the field of exoplanet research. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and other advanced observatories aim to analyze the atmospheric composition of exoplanets, including gas giants. By examining the absorption spectra of these planets as they pass in front of their host stars, scientists can deduce the presence of various compounds, potentially including complex carbon molecules.\n\nThis research not only helps us understand the diversity of planetary atmospheres but also the chemistry of potentially habitable planets. While gas giants themselves are unlikely to support life as we know it, their moons might offer more clement conditions. Furthermore, understanding carbon chemistry in planetary atmospheres can inform our search for biosignatures\u2014the chemical signs of life\u2014on other worlds.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn summary, gas giants with clouds of carbons and pancarbons represent a fascinating research frontier. The study of these carbon-rich environments extends our knowledge of planetary atmospheres and the chemistry of the universe, highlighting the incredible diversity of worlds beyond our Solar System."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user asked about methods of disinfection and then about the ecology of microorganisms, including topics like symbiosis, antagonistic relationships, and bacteriocins.

If you're referring to blood or substances that repel sharks rather than attract them, there are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Sharks and Blood:** Sharks are known for their acute sense of smell, and they can detect even the smallest amounts of blood in water. This characteristic often leads to the misconception that sharks are drawn to any kind of blood, no matter the circumstances. However, research indicates that sharks are more interested in the blood of their natural prey (such as fish) than human blood, for instance. The exact reaction might vary among different shark species.\n\n2. **Repellent Substances:** When considering substances that could potentially repel sharks, including those mimicking blood, research and development in shark repellent technologies have been ongoing for years. Some studies have explored substances that could repel sharks, including chemicals found in the dead bodies of sharks themselves (as the smell of a dead shark can signal danger to other sharks) and synthetic compounds. The idea is that these substances could interfere with the sharks' sensory signals and deter them from approaching.\n\n3. **Repulsive to Sharks:** If by \"repulsive bloods\" you mean blood or synthetic compounds designed to be unattractive or repelling to sharks, this falls into the realm of shark repellent research. There is interest in developing products that could protect humans without harming sharks, such as magnetic or electric fields, and specific chemical compounds.\n\nIn summary, while sharks are attracted to the blood of their prey, there is ongoing research into substances that could repel them. This includes exploring whether certain types of synthetic \"blood\" or other compounds might be unattractive or even repelling to sharks, potentially for use in personal protection or conservation efforts.

Classification systems in the past were largely practical or based on observable characteristics but did not focus on artistic qualities like symmetry for their primary grouping mechanism.\n\n9) The method for organizing life that was so effective that we use it today for modern taxonomy is the system developed by Carl Linnaeus. Linnaeus introduced a binomial nomenclature system that classifies organisms based on hierarchical categories such as kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species.\n\n10) An example of convergent evolution is the development of wings in bats and birds. Both evolved the ability to fly independently, with bats being mammals and birds being avians, showing that similar environmental pressures can lead to the development of similar traits in unrelated species. A less commonly discussed example could be the similar body shapes of ichthyosaurs (extinct marine reptiles) and dolphins (mammals), which developed independently to adapt to aquatic life.\n\n11) Paleozoic, meaning \"old life,\" refers to a time period in Earth's history (about 541 to 252 million years ago) when life forms were predominantly marine, along with the emergence of insects and land plants. Three examples of life forms from the Paleozoic era are trilobites (marine arthropods), brachiopods (shellfish), and the first terrestrial plants like Cooksonia.\n\n12) A fly trapped in amber is an example of preservation, specifically a type of fossilization known as resin fossilization or amber entrapment.\n\n13) If a gopher's burrow were to be fossilized, this would be an example of a trace fossil. Trace fossils are indirect evidence of past life, such as footprints, burrows, or feces, rather than physical remains of the organism itself.\n\n14) The common ancestor to all vertebrates is thought to be a type of ancient, jawless fish known as a conodont.\n\n15) The common ancestor to all tetrapods (four-limbed animals) is believed to be a fish-like creature with limbs instead of fins, similar to Tiktaalik, which exhibits both aquatic and terrestrial adaptations.\n\n16) Land was first colonized by plants during the Ordovician period, approximately 470 million years ago.\n\n17) Land was first colonized by tetrapods during the Devonian period, around 370 million years ago.\n\n18) The Atlantic Ocean began to form during the Jurassic period, approximately 200 million years ago, as a result of the breakup of the supercontinent Pangea.\n\n19) Flowering plants (angiosperms) evolved during the Cretaceous period, around 145 to 66 million years ago.\n\n20) The change in the state of matter that requires the greatest amount of energy (ignoring sublimation and deposition) is vaporization, specifically boiling water into steam.\n\n21) Water is most dense at approximately 4 degrees Celsius (39.2 degrees Fahrenheit), at which point it sinks below warmer or colder water.\n\n22) The three ways we can change the state of matter of water are by freezing (solidification), melting (liquefaction), and vaporization (evaporation/boiling).\n\n23) A salinity sink that removes salt from the ocean for the longest time is the process of sedimentation, where minerals precipitate out of ocean water and become part of the seafloor sediments.\n\n24) Our oceans are so saline mainly because of the weathering and erosion of rocks on land, which releases minerals and salts that are carried to the oceans by rivers. Over millions of years, these processes have contributed to the ocean's salinity despite the low salinity of river water.\n\n25) The primary constituents of salinity come from the weathering of rocks on land. The minerals and ions produced by this weathering, such as sodium and chloride ions, are carried into the oceans by rivers, becoming a major source of the salts in seawater.\n\n26) The rapid change in temperature with depth is known as the thermocline.\n\n27) The halocline, which involves changes in salinity, controls the deposition of calcareous ooze due to its impact on the solubility of calcium carbonate in seawater. However, temperature and depth (related to the thermocline and pressure) also significantly affect the deposition of calcareous ooze.\n\n28) The deposition of siliceous ooze tells us that the depositional environment is rich in silica, often associated with productive regions where siliceous organisms like diatoms and radiolarians thrive. It typically indicates cold or nutrient-rich waters.\n\n29) Earth\u2019s rotation leads to the Coriolis effect, a feature that creates circular ocean currents, or gyres, by deflecting moving objects (like air and water masses) to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\n30) The movement of water that causes water to flow uphill in a sense is driven by differences in heat and salinity (thermohaline circulation), creating density gradients that can cause deep, colder, and saltier water to move towards the surface or shallower waters.\n\n31) A circular ocean current is called a gyre."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user asked a series of questions about ocean currents and their properties.

Thermodynamics is a fundamental branch of physics that deals with the study of heat, work, temperature, and energy. It's a fascinating subject that helps us understand how energy is transformed from one form to another and how these transformations affect matter. The principles of thermodynamics have profound implications in various scientific and engineering disciplines, including mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, astrophysics, and even biology.\n\nThere are four main laws of thermodynamics that form the foundation of this subject:\n\n1. **Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics**: This law introduces the concept of temperature. It states that if two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. This law allows us to measure temperature and essentially says that temperature is a fundamental property of matter.\n\n2. **First Law of Thermodynamics**: Often known as the law of energy conservation, it states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another or transferred from one object to another. In other words, the total energy of an isolated system remains constant. This law is mathematically expressed as \u0394U = Q - W, where \u0394U represents the change in internal energy of the system, Q is the heat added to the system, and W is the work done by the system.\n\n3. **Second Law of Thermodynamics**: This law introduces the concept of entropy, a measure of disorder or randomness in a system. The second law states that in any energy exchange, if no energy enters or leaves the system, the potential energy of the state will always be less than that of the initial state, which is known as entropy. In simpler terms, it means that systems tend to evolve toward a state of greater disorder or entropy. This law explains why certain processes are irreversible and why energy transformations are not 100% efficient.\n\n4. **Third Law of Thermodynamics**: This law states that as the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero (0 Kelvin), the entropy of the system approaches a minimum value. At absolute zero, the system is in a state of perfect order, meaning the particles are at rest and showing no movement. This is more of a theoretical limit, as absolute zero cannot be achieved in practice.\n\nA couple of important concepts that arise from these laws include:\n\n- **Thermal Equilibrium**: A condition in which two objects that are in contact with each other do not exchange any heat, because they are at the same temperature.\n- **Heat Engine**: A device that converts heat energy into mechanical work, operating between two temperature reservoirs.\n- **Refrigerator/Cooling Systems**: Devices that use work to transfer heat from a cooler area to a warmer area, effectively cooling the cooler area further.\n\nThermodynamics is rich with theoretical concepts that have very practical applications. These principles help us design engines, refrigerators, heating systems, and even understand biological processes. It helps us grasp how energy flows through our world, shaping the natural processes around us and driving the technologies we depend on every day."}, {"role": "user", "content": "do you know chemistry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, I can help explain concepts and answer questions related to chemistry.

While the idea of \"never-ending money\" is highly appealing, it's important to manage expectations and understand the principles of investing that can help create a sustainable income stream over the long term. Here are some strategies and considerations for building a portfolio with the goal of generating continuous income:\n\n### 1. Diversification\nDiversifying your investment portfolio is crucial. A well-diversified portfolio spreads out risk and can include a mix of stocks, bonds, real estate, and other income-generating assets. Diversification can help protect your income stream against market volatility and sector-specific downturns.\n\n### 2. Dividend-Paying Stocks\nInvesting in stocks that pay regular dividends can be a key component of a portfolio designed for ongoing income. Companies that have a history of paying and increasing dividends can provide a relatively steady income stream.\n\n### 3. Fixed Income Investments\nBonds and other fixed income securities can provide regular interest payments, contributing to your income stream. Including government bonds, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds in your portfolio can offer varying degrees of risk and return.\n\n### 4. Real Estate and REITs\nInvesting in real estate directly or through Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) can provide rental income. Real estate investments can be a good hedge against inflation and provide diversification outside of the stock and bond markets.\n\n### 5. Income Funds\nThere are mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) specifically designed to generate income. These funds can invest in a variety of income-producing assets, making it easier for investors to achieve diversification.\n\n### 6. Annuities\nFor those looking for guaranteed income, annuities can be an option. Purchased from an insurance company, annuities can provide a steady income stream for a defined period or for life. However, annuities come with their own set of complexities and costs.\n\n### 7. Withdrawal Strategy\nDeveloping a sensible withdrawal strategy is important to ensure your money lasts. The \"4% rule\" is a commonly referenced strategy that suggests withdrawing 4% of your portfolio in the first year of retirement and adjusting the amount for inflation each year thereafter.\n\n### Monitoring and Adjusting\nA portfolio designed for never-ending income requires regular monitoring and adjustments. Market conditions change, as do your financial needs and goals. Regularly reviewing and rebalancing your portfolio can help maintain an appropriate risk level and ensure your investment strategy remains aligned with your income objectives.\n\n### Risk Management\nIt's important to understand that all investments come with risk, and the goal of never-ending money cannot be guaranteed. The key is to manage risk through prudent investment choices, diversification, and a clear understanding of your risk tolerance.\n\nCreating a financial portfolio aimed at generating a never-ending stream of income is a realistic goal, but it requires careful planning, ongoing management, and realistic expectations about the returns and risks involved.

For instance, if you have scripts that define functions which need to be available immediately as the page starts to render, you might include them here. However, placing scripts in the `<head>` can delay the rendering of the page because the browser will execute the script before it proceeds to render the HTML content.

One of the most compelling arguments is based on the problem of evil, particularly in its logical form. Here\u2019s a simplified version:\n\n1. If an omnipotent (all-powerful), omnibenevolent (all-good), and omniscient (all-knowing) God exists, then there would be no evil in the world.\n2. There is evil in the world.\n3. Therefore, an omnipotent, omnibenevolent, and omniscient God does not exist.\n\nThis argument hinges on the observation that a world created by such a god should be free of unnecessary suffering and evil, given the deity\u2019s power to prevent it, the knowledge to understand it, and the benevolence to want to prevent it. Yet, we observe much unnecessary suffering and evil that an all-powerful and all-good being could and presumably would prevent. Proponents of this argument claim that the existence of evil is incompatible with the existence of the traditional theistic God.\n\nOf course, this is just one argument and there are various counterarguments and perspectives within theistic traditions that attempt to address the problem of evil, such as free will defense and soul-making theodicies. The debate over the existence of God remains a deeply complex and nuanced philosophical and theological discussion."}, {"role": "user", "content": "give me another best argument for why god doesnt exist"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another influential argument against the existence of God, particularly from a scientific and empirical standpoint, is the argument from naturalism. This argument does not rely on moral considerations like the problem of evil but instead focuses on the explanatory power of naturalistic explanations for phenomena that were once attributed to divine intervention. Here's a simplified outline of the argument:\n\n1. Historically, natural phenomena once attributed to the actions of gods (e.g., thunder, earthquakes, disease) are now understood through natural laws and processes without requiring the hypothesis of a god or gods.\n2. Scientific methods have consistently shown that natural, not supernatural, explanations are sufficient to explain the workings of the universe, from the large scale (cosmology) to the small scale (quantum mechanics).\n3. If all phenomena can be explained through natural processes and laws, the hypothesis of God\u2019s existence becomes unnecessary.\n4. Ockham\u2019s Razor (the principle that states one should not multiply entities beyond necessity) suggests that if a hypothesis is unnecessary, it should be discarded.\n5. Therefore, the explanatory success of naturalism and the lack of empirical evidence for God's intervention in the world make the hypothesis of God's existence unnecessary and less plausible.\n\nThe Argument from Naturalism leans heavily on the assumption that all events and phenomena can be, or will eventually be, explained through natural laws without needing to invoke a supernatural being. Critics might argue that this does not disprove God's existence outright but rather challenges specific understandings of how God might interact with the world. Furthermore, proponents of theistic beliefs might argue that God is the ultimate foundation of these natural laws themselves, thus incorporating naturalism within a broader theistic framework.\n\nThis argument exemplifies how ongoing advancements in science have shifted perspectives and debates surrounding the existence of God, emphasizing empirical evidence and explanatory simplicity."}, {"role": "user", "content": "thanks"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You're welcome!

One way to foster deeper interactions between a chatbot and its user is through personas, aspects of the user\u2019s character that provide insights into their personality, motivations, and behaviors. Training Natural Language Processing (NLP) models on a diverse and comprehensive persona-based dataset can lead to conversational models that create a deeper connection with the user, and maintain their engagement. In this paper, we leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a large, high-quality conversational dataset from a seed dataset. We propose a Generator-Critic architecture framework to expand the initial dataset, while improving the quality of its conversations. The Generator is an LLM prompted to output conversations. The Critic consists of a mixture of expert LLMs that control the quality of the generated conversations. These experts select the best generated conversations, which we then use to improve the Generator. We release Synthetic-Persona-Chat1\n1\nDataset available at https://github.com/google-research-datasets/Synthetic-Persona-Chat, consisting of 20k conversations seeded from Persona-Chat Zhang et al. (2018). We evaluate the quality of Synthetic-Persona-Chat and our generation framework on different dimensions through extensive experiments, and observe that the losing rate of Synthetic-Persona-Chat against Persona-Chat during Turing test decreases from 17.2% to 8.8% over three iterations.\n1 Introduction\n\nEvery person is a story. Systems that interact with people must understand their underlying stories to effectively engage with them. Unfortunately, many existing datasets used for training conversational agents do not sufficiently model their users. Personas - abstract user representations that express the \u201cstory\u201d of a person based on their background and preferences - have been widely used for human-centered design in a variety of domains, including marketing, system design, and healthcare Pruitt and Grudin (2003b). Prior persona-based conversational datasets, like Persona-Chat (PC) Zhang et al. (2018), suffer from several limitations, such as small size, static dialogues that cannot easily be updated with new topics, irrelevant utterances, and contradictory persona attributes Wu et al. (2019). In this paper, we propose a novel framework for generating large, dynamic, persona-based conversational datasets that capture the breadth and depth of human experience.\n\nPersonas Pruitt and Grudin (2003a); Cooper and Saffo (1999) have been widely used in a variety of domains and applications, including creating narratives for patients and sharing educational messages in healthcare Massey et al. (2021), targeting users in marketing van Pinxteren et al. (2020); Fuglerud et al. (2020), and communicating with workers in management Claus (2019). Conversational agents use personas to generate more interesting and engaging conversations with their users Zhou et al. (2019); Shum et al. (2019).\n\nCreating persona-based datasets is difficult: the process is labor-intensive, the outputs must be updated to reflect current events and new concepts, and there are often quality concerns. Existing persona-based datasets have resulted from labor-intensive data collection processes Zhang et al. (2018); Zhong et al. (2020) involving humans to create or validate personas, create fictional persona-based conversations, and ensure the conversations are coherent. Moreover, even after these datasets are created, it is difficult to update them with the latest topics Lee et al. (2022), such as current events, new concepts, products, or social trends Lazaridou et al. (2021). Finally, existing persona-based datasets do not guarantee faithfulness, a criterion we introduce to describe the alignment between participants\u2019 utterances and their personas.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce a new framework for generating large, customized persona-based conversational datasets that uses unsupervised LLMs to reduce human labor, introduces methods to generate, expand, and update personas automatically, and enforces a set of quality criteria including faithfulness to ensure dialogues are human-like. Our persona-based conversational dataset generation framework consists of a three-level pipeline:\n\n    1.\n\n    User Generation\n    2.\n\n    User Pairing\n    3.\n\n    Conversation Generation\n\nThe user generation step takes a set of seed personas, and augments it to create plausible user profiles. The user pairing step matches users to participate in conversations. The conversation generation produces plausible conversations between the selected user pairs. The conversation generation component uses a method similar to self-feedback Madaan et al. (2023) to iteratively improve the quality of generated samples.\n\nWe used the proposed framework to create Synthetic-Persona-Chat (SPC), a conversational dataset with 5\u2062k user personas, and 20\u2062k faithful dialogues. The framework we defined to create this dataset can be reused to define specialized personas, such as user music profiles, etc. to create application-specific datasets.\n\nOur contributions are:\n\n    \u2022\n\n    We propose an unsupervised approach to generate, and extend specialized personas using LLMs.\n    \u2022\n\n    We introduce and evaluate a framework based on LLMs to evolve a dataset while imposing different objectives on it.\n    \u2022\n\n    We release Synthetic-Persona-Chat, a high-quality, faithful, persona-based conversational dataset useful for several conversational tasks, such as training persona inference models.\n\n2 Definitions\n\nWe define the faithful persona-based dialogue generation task. We begin by defining the persona-based dialogue generation task. We then formally define the faithfulness criteria as a desired quality for the generated dialogues. Throughout this section, we use \u03c0 to refer to persona attributes (individual sentences which, together, form the user persona), U to refer to user profiles, and D to refer to conversations (dialogues).\n\nPersona Attributes We define a user persona attribute as a sentence describing this user. \"I like ice cream\", \"I have two brothers\" and \"My native language is Tamazight\" are all examples of persona attributes. Let \u03a9 be the universal set of persona attributes. \u03a9 contains all natural language descriptions of all tangible features of any person, which is unbounded.\n\nPersona Categories To help organize the vast space of personas, we adopt the approach of Lee et al. (2022) who introduced persona categories. Persona categories are groups of persona attributes that describe the same semantic feature of the user. In our work, we associate each persona category with a corresponding query that can be answered with all persona attributes in that category. For example, job and family situation are persona categories, and corresponding queries might be \u201cWhat is your occupation?\u201d, and \u201cDo you have a family?\u201d.\n\nPersona Attribute Structure Persona attributes can overlap. For instance, the attribute \"I introduced my kids to scuba diving at a young age\" overlaps with the attribute \"My eldest son goes to elementary school\", since both include the \"parenthood\" feature of the user. Moreover, some persona attributes form a hierarchy, and some persona attributes are specific cases of other attributes.\n\nUser Profile We define a user profile as a set of persona attributes that can be used to describe a user. For a realistic user, the persona attributes describing a user profile should not contradict each other, and be consistent. An arbitrary persona attribute set U\u2282\u03a9 is a consistent set of persona attribute if, and only if:\n\t\n\u2200\u03c01\u2208U,\u2204\u2062\u03a02\u2282U:(\u03a02\u2260\u2205)\u2227(\u03a02\u2192\u00ac\u2062\u03c01)\n\t\n\nPersona-based Conversation A persona-based conversation D contains utterances such that at least one persona attribute from each user profile can be inferred from it. For example, the persona attribute \"I am a parent\" can be inferred from the utterance \"I just dropped off my son at school\". A persona-based conversation model is a generative model that takes a pair of user profiles (U1, U2) as input, and returns a persona-based dialogue D between these two users.\n\nFaithfulness One crucial quality for a persona-based conversation is that it should align with the user profile. Inspired by Daheim et al. (2023) which introduces dialogue system faithfulness to the knowledge contained in relevant documents, we specify the criterion of faithfulness to characterize the alignment between the utterances of a user in a persona-based conversation and their profile. The faithfulness criterion enforces the constraint that the utterances of a user should not decrease the likelihood of their persona. This criterion assumes the existence of both a prior probability of persona attributes, and an inference model for determining the probability of persona attributes conditioned on utterances. Let M be such an inference model, (U1, U2) a pair of user profiles, and D a persona-based conversation between them. To be a faithful conversation based on M, D should not contain any contradicting evidence to the persona attributes of the speakers: passing the conversation D as input to the inference model M should not reduce the inference probability of persona attributes in either of the user profiles U1 or U2. In other words, the probability of any persona attribute in the user profiles based on conversation D should not be less than the probability of that persona attribute without any assumptions. Formally, we call a conversation D faithful with respect to the user profiles U1 and U2, and inference model M if the following condition holds: \u2200\u03c0\u2208U1\u222aU2:PM\u2062(\u03c0|D)\u2265PM\u2062(\u03c0). Where PM\u2062(\u03c0|D) indicates the probability that M infers the persona \u03c0 given conversation D. We show examples of faithful, and unfaithful conversations in Figure 1.\nRefer to caption\nFigure 1: Unfaithful Conversation (Left): Loving steak is negatively correlated with the persona attribute \"I am a vegetarian\". Faithful Conversation (Right): It introduces no information that contradicts or weakens the user\u2019s profile.\n3 Method\n\nIn this section, we introduce our method to generate persona-based conversations. We create such conversations with minimum human input, starting from an initial dataset. Our process consists of three steps, as shown in Figure 2: user generation, user pairing, and conversation generation. The first component augments a set of seed persona attributes \u03a00 into an expanded set of persona attributes \u03a0e, from which it creates user profiles. The second component pairs user profiles as interlocutors of a conversation. The third and final component uses an iterative process to generate high-quality conversations among user profile pairs. We detail each of these components below.\nRefer to caption\nFigure 2: Dataset Augmentation Pipeline\n3.1 User Generation\n\nThe User Generation component is split into two sub-components:\n\n    1.\n\n    Persona Expansion\n    2.\n\n    User Profile Construction\n\nWe bootstrap seed persona attributes by using various prompts Brown et al. (2020b) to generate new persona attributes in the Persona Expansion step (Refer to Appendix A.1 for more details on the prompts used). We then create new user profiles by iteratively selecting random user persona attributes from the expanded persona attributes. We employ a Natural Language Inference (NLI) model to ensure the consistency of the constructed user profiles.\n3.1.1 Persona Expansion\n\nWe propose an unsupervised method to augment a set of seed persona attributes \u03a00 into a super-set \u03a0e. Unlike previous approaches Lee et al. (2022), our method is independent of human knowledge or intervention, making it capable of creating specialized personas in new domains. We proceed in two steps: query induction, and persona bootstrapping. In the query induction phase, we identify persona categories in \u03a00, along with associated queries. We then expand these queries into a set Q that also covers unobserved persona categories. The persona bootstrapping step leverages the category-based query set Q, and the initial persona attribute seed set \u03a00 to generate new persona attributes. Both of these steps are based on the bootstrapping technique Yarowsky (1995), and involve prompting an LLM. We provide a detailed description of these two steps in the following.\n\nQuery Induction As described in Section 2, each persona attribute belongs to at least one persona category, and each category is associated with a corresponding query that can be answered with persona attributes in that category. The query induction process initially identifies the queries associated with persona categories in \u03a00. It then bootstraps queries by feeding them to a prompted LLM to create more queries that are associated with unobserved categories, ultimately creating a query set Q. Including queries associated with unobserved persona categories facilitates the creation of a more diverse set of personas, and increases the scale of augmentation.\n\nThe query induction relies on the following assumption:\n\nAssumption Let \u2133 be an LLM, and let \u0393 be the set of all queries associated with all persona categories. If two persona attributes \u03c01 and \u03c02 belong to the same persona category, then there exists a query q\u2133\u2208\u0393 such that \u03c01 and \u03c02 are \u2133\u2019s output to q\u2133.\n\nThe persona attributes \"I am a doctor\" and \"I am a truck driver\", for instance, both belong to the \"job\" category, leading to the query \"What is your job?\". We use an agglomerative clustering method to identify the persona categories in \u03a00. Let C be an arbitrary persona cluster in \u03a00. To generate a query for C, we select a random subset of persona attributes in C, and create a prompt using these samples. We employ this strategy to generate queries for all the clusters identified in \u03a00, and create a set of queries, which we refer to as Q0. Details on the clustering, query induction, together with examples of clusters, persona attributes, and induced queries are available in Appendix A.1. We come up with queries for new, unobserved persona categories by bootstrapping the queries in Q0: starting from Q=Q0, we iteratively sample a set of queries from Q, and create a prompt by concatenating them. We then prompt the LLM to generate a new query, and add it to the query set Q, as shown in Figure 3. We generated a total of |Q|=188 queries. This set of category-specific queries Q is later used to guide the LLM to generate new persona attributes from the specified category. Thus, higher values of |Q| result in greater diversity within the expanded persona attribute set.\nRefer to caption\nFigure 3: Query Induction Steps\n\nPersona Bootstrapping We use the persona attribute seed set \u03a00 and category-specific queries Q to generate new persona attributes through a bootstrapping process. We initialize \u03a0 to \u03a00. At every iteration, we randomly select a subset of persona attributes from \u03a0, and create a set of prompts as follows: we first concatenate a set of persona attributes s. For every query q\u2208Q, we then combine the concatenated samples s, and the query q to create a category-specific persona prompt. This prompt guides the LLM to generate a persona attribute for that persona category. The set of prompts obtained from this process is {s\u2062q|q\u2208Q}. We only add a new persona attribute to the set if its BERT embeddings Devlin et al. (2019) are not too close from existing ones, so as to prevent the addition of duplicates.\n\nEach of these prompts is then fed to the LLM to create a new persona attribute, which is subsequently added to the set of persona attributes \u03a0 for the next iteration. We continue this iterative process until we have generated a total of 5k persona attributes. Figure 4 illustrates the persona bootstrapping process. Table 6 in the appendix contains the prompt template used in this component.\nRefer to caption\nFigure 4: Query-based Persona Bootstrapping Process\n3.1.2 User Profile Construction\n\nWe build user profiles incrementally by sampling persona attributes from \u03a0e, and adding the eligible ones. A persona attribute is eligible if it adheres to the criteria of consistency and non-redundancy. In other words, it should not contradict any attribute already in the user profile, and it should not be inferred by other persona attribute. We assess the consistency and redundancy of user profiles by leveraging an NLI model, and persona attribute clustering, respectively. The NLI model we employ is based on T5 Raffel et al. (2019), and has been trained on the TRUE dataset Honovich et al. (2022).\n\nWe create a user profile U by iteratively selecting a random candidate persona attribute \u03c0\u2032\u2208\u03a0e. We use the NLI model to assess whether \u03c0\u2032 contradicts any persona attribute in the profile. This is determined by the condition: \u2200\u03c0\u2208U:(\u03c0\u2032\u2192\u0338\u00ac\u2062\u03c0)\u2227(\u03c0\u2192\u0338\u00ac\u2062\u03c0\u2032), where \u2192 is an inference. Additionally, we evaluate the similarity of \u03c0\u2032 to the persona attributes in U to prevent the addition of redundant attributes. We add \u03c0\u2032 to U if it meets the consistency and non-redundancy criteria. We repeat this process until the user profile contains 5 persona attributes. Please refer to Appendix A.1 for more details on the user profile construction.\n3.2 User Pairing\n\nIn this component, we identify potential pairs of users for conversations. As the conversations are persona-based, we hypothesize that they will be more engaging if the users\u2019 personas exhibit more commonalities. We assign a similarity score to every pair of user profiles (U1,U2), indicating their semantic similarity. We leverage BERT to represent the user profiles. The similarity between U1 and U2 is defined as: |{(\u03c01,\u03c02)|\u03c01\u2208U1,\u03c02\u2208U2,\u2203c:\u03c01,\u03c02\u2208c}| Where c is a persona attributes cluster. The semantic similarity is quantified by the number of common persona categories in the user profiles. We pair U1 and U2 if their similarity exceeds a threshold of 2.\n3.3 Conversation Generation\n\nOur Conversation Generation component is similar to a general-purpose dataset generation framework that generates data samples, and refines them based on a set of predefined criteria, which we refer to as policies Madaan et al. (2023). The flexibility in the choice of policies for data generation allows us to emphasize different objectives. Once the active policies are selected, this component generates new data samples using a few input samples. The input to our Conversation Generation framework consists of a set of paired user profiles, a few samples of user profiles along with a persona-based conversation between them, and conversation quality metrics as policies. We follow a Generator-Critic architecture, and iteratively create the dataset following the steps shown in Figure 5:\nStep 1 The Generator outputs candidate conversations between persona pairs using a few initial conversation samples.\nStep 2 The Critic evaluates the candidate conversations based on the predetermined policies, and selects the best candidate conversations.\nStep 3 The best candidate conversations are added to the dataset for the next iteration of generation.\nThis iterative process of selecting the top candidates and adding them to the dataset gradually improves the performance of the Generator.\n\nWithout any loss of generality, we implement both the Generator and the Critic based on LLMs. Specifically, the Generator prompts an LLM to create candidate conversations, while the Critic prompts an LLM to evaluate the quality of the generated conversations.\n\nWe provide more details on the Generator, Critic, and the policies we used.\nRefer to caption\nFigure 5: The Generator-Critic Architecture for Conversation Generation\n\nThe Generator outputs conversations for pairs of users (U1,U2) by prompting an LLM Brown et al. (2020b); Wei et al. (2023). At each iteration, it randomly selects 5 samples from an initial set of conversations, each containing a pair of user profiles and a dialogue among them. It feeds these samples to a template that instructs the LLM to generate a series of candidate conversations for the given user pair. The template, and a sample generated conversation are available in Table 6, and Table 8 in the appendix.\n\nThe Critic selects the best generated conversations to fine-tune the Generator. A conversation is deemed high-quality if it complies with the policies of the Critic. Given the multifaceted nature of the conversation evaluations, we use a Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach. Each expert evaluates the conversation based on a specific policy. In this paper, we incorporate three types of experts, each with distinct criteria: general conversation quality, persona faithfulness, and toxicity. Collectively, these experts select the best generated conversations (the single best in our experiments). We describe each type of expert, and the collective decision-making process below.\n\nGeneral Conversation Quality experts assess conversation quality using the Fine-grained Evaluation of Dialog (FED) metrics introduced in Mehri and Esk\u00e9nazi (2020). These experts use verbalized forms of the policies from FED as prompts. For instance, the \"conversation depth quality expert\" transforms the \"depth policy\" from FED into a prompt like \"Which conversation is a deeper conversation between user 1 and user 2?\". Our system instructs the LLM to compare each pair of candidate conversations based on these policies, resulting in pairwise comparisons. The list of policies and their baseline performance are presented in Table 5 in Appendix A.2.\n\nThe Faithfulness expert ensures the consistency of the generated conversations with the user profiles. It uses an LLM to identify instances of unfaithful conversations. The faithfulness prompt provides the LLM with explicit instructions, user profiles, and human-curated examples of unfaithful conversations.\n\nThe Toxicity expert detects any conversation that exhibits harmful traits, including bias and hate.\n\nThe Critic filters unfaithful and toxic conversations out. It then selects the best conversations using a majority vote among the General Conversation Quality experts. The selected instances are added to the dataset for the next iteration of the Generator.\n4 Evaluation\n\nWe evaluate different aspects of our dataset generation framework, and the resulting dataset - referred to as Synthetic-Persona-Chat - which is created using an instruction fine-tuned LLM with 24 billion parameters Chung et al. (2022). We compare Synthetic-Persona-Chat (SPC) against the widely used Persona-Chat (PC) dataset across different dimensions. We begin by evaluating the quality of the personas we generate. We then evaluate SPC using both automatic metrics, and human assessment. We analyze other aspects of SPC, such as toxicity and diversity in appendices B.1 and B.1.\n4.1 Evaluation of the Expanded Personas\n\nWe evaluate our persona expansion module on two seed datasets: Wikipedia, and Persona-Chat. The Wikipedia personas are created by crawling the 1,000 most active contributors2\n2\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_Wikipedians_by_number_of_edits, and extracting user boxes from their pages. We expand both datasets using our framework, and evaluate the expanded persona attribute sets using automatic metrics. Table 1 compares the original persona sets to the expanded ones on a few dimensions. We observe that our persona expansion increases the number of persona attributes in SPC by 119%, while maintaining the original persona categories and expanding them by 71% compared to the persona attributes in PC. Moreover, the lengths of the new generated persona attributes are 107% longer in SPC, indicating that the new personas exhibit greater detail and specificity. We observe a similar trend when applying our persona expansion to the Wikipedia persona set, with a 108% increase in the number of persona attributes, a 140% increase in persona categories, and a 45% growth in persona attribute lengths. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in expanding and diversifying persona sets.\nDataset \tPersona-Chat \tSynthetic-Persona-Chat \tWikipedia \tWikipedia+\n# Persona Attributes \t4,723 \t10,371 \t8768 \t18,293\n# Clusters \t323 \t553 \t408 \t986\nInter-cluster Dist \t0.836 \t0.863 \t0.816 \t0.85\nAVG length \t7.65 \t15.9* \t10.45 \t15.2*\nTable 1: Evaluation of the expanded persona sets. The numbers with * indicate the metric value of the newly generated persona attributes to contrast with the initial set.\n4.2 Next Utterance Prediction\n\nA persona-based conversation reflects the speaker\u2019s persona explicitly or implicitly. Therefore, we expect the inclusion of information about speaker personas to enhance the performance of next utterance prediction models in such conversations. In this experiment, we assess the impact of incorporating speaker personas as prior information on both ranking, and generative - Transformer based Vaswani et al. (2017) - next utterance prediction models. We create a subset of SPC containing conversations among user pairs included in PC for a fair comparison.\n\t\tPersona-Chat \tSynthetic-Persona-Chat\nMethod \tMetric \tNone \tPersona \t% Change \tNone \tPersona \t% Change\nIR Baseline \thit@1 \t18.69 \t36.86 \t+97 \t19.37 (19.92) \t39.6 (26.23) \t+104 (+31)\nTransformer (Ranker) \thit@1 \t14.24 \t19.21 \t+35 \t9.71 (64.24) \t11.74 (68.82) \t+21 (+7)\nTransformer (Generator) \thit@1 \t8.54 \t6.78 \t-20 \t6.89 (41.32) \t6.66 (37.35) \t-3 (-9)\nPerplexity \t122.5 \t173.3 \t+41 \t1032 (5.24) \t1126 (5.73) \t+9 (+9)\nBLUE \t0.120 \t0.094 \t-21 \t0.097 (0.289) \t0.083 (0.251) \t-14 (-13)\nROUGE \t0.141 \t0.113 \t-24 \t0.123 (0.348) \t0.107 (0.309) \t-13 (-11)\nTable 2: Results of the next utterance prediction experiment. Performance of the trained model on the test split of Persona-Chat is represented by the numbers in the table, while the numbers in parentheses indicate results for the test split of Synthetic-Persona-Chat.\n\nWe observe (Table 2) that the performance of ranking models increases when personas are given to the models as input for both datasets. Specifically, the Transformer (Ranker) model, known for its ability to capture conversational complexity, exhibits higher performance in SPC when evaluated on the SPC test set compared to the PC test set. However, it demonstrates relatively weaker performance when trained on the PC. This implies that SPC contains more intricate and coherent conversations.\n\nThe Transformer (Ranker) trained on SPC achieves a hit@1 of 64.24 on SPC test, 350% higher than PC (14.24). This suggests that the Transformer model can more accurately predict the next utterance in SPC, pointing to a greater coherency in conversations.\n\nThe performance of the Information Retrieval (IR) Baseline model is slightly higher for SPC: it rises by 31% when conditioned on user personas, which is lower than 97% improvement in PC. A key contributing factor for the performance improvement of the retrieval-based model (IR Baseline) on PC given the personas, is the participants\u2019 tendency to copy persona words in the conversations, whereas in SPC the personas are more implicitly reflected in the conversations. The implicit reflection of personas in SPC, makes the task more challenging for word based retrieval models, necessitating reasoning that goes beyond word level. However, when the model is trained on SPC and tested on PC, the improvement is as high as when the model is trained on PC, i.e. 104% compared to 97%.\n\nThe performance of generative models is low for this task since these models are not trained with the ranking objective. However, the performance difference while the models are conditioned on personas is lower for the model trained on SPC, with a 20% drop for the model trained on PC against 3% drop in the model trained on SPC. The increase in perplexity is 9% in SPC compared to 41% in PC. The lower rate of perplexity increase and performance drop of the model given user personas as input highlights the higher alignment of conversations with personas in SPC.\n\nWe also evaluate the performance of the next utterance prediction models when given no user, one user, and both user personas. The results suggest a higher degree of bidirectionality in SPC. We refer the reader to the Appendix B.1 for more details.\n4.3 Human Evaluation\n\nWe compare the quality of the conversations generated by our framework against those in Persona-Chat. We randomly select 200 conversations from PC, together with their corresponding user pairs, and use our method to generate conversations among the same users. We start by following Gehrmann et al. (2019) in running a human experiment to try and detect AI-generated content. We conduct a Turing test where we present pairs of conversations to humans, and ask them to identify the synthetically generated one. This test is carried out on the generated conversations at the end of each iteration of creating SPC. We repeat the test for conversations generated for new persona pairs, which we refer to as iteration 3*, i.e. we pair each of these conversations with a random conversation from PC. For a robust evaluation, every pair of conversations is annotated by 3 human evaluators, and the majority vote is used as the final annotation. Details of this test are available in Appendix B.2. The results of this experiment can be found in Table 3. We observe that the losing rate of SPC is reduced by 48% from SPC Iter 1 to SPC Iter 3, and dropped below the rate of 10%. Interestingly, 91% of the conversations in SPC, which are synthetically generated, are judged as human-like as the conversations generated by humans. Moreover, conversations generated for new personas (Iteration 3*) are deemed artificial in only 8.04% of cases, showing that SPC is more realistic than PC.\n\nWe also evaluate the faithfulness of the generated conversations. For each conversation, we provide annotators with a faithfulness annotation task including the speakers\u2019 persona attributes and distractor persona attribute options as shown in Figure 8. We evaluate faithfulness during 3 iterations of conversation generation for the selected 200 user pairs, and the annotators evaluate the generated conversations for each pair in every iteration. The results show that, while improving the Turing test results, faithfulness of conversations are consistently higher than 75% with at most 3% variation in between iterations, indicating high faithfulness in all iterations.\n\nFinally, we assess the impact of LLM size on the quality of the generated dataset within our framework. We create a variant of SPC using an LLM with 540 billion parameters (LLM2). Table 3 presents human evaluations comparing the smaller LLM in multiple iterations to a single-iteration approach with LLM2. The larger model exhibits a 5% advantage in the Turing test over the first iteration of dataset generation over the smaller model. After two iterations, however, the multi-iteration approach outperforms the first iteration of the bigger model, showing our framework\u2019s capacity for cost-effective, high-quality conversation generation.\nConversation Source \tLose \tWin \tTie \tFaithful\nSPC Iter 1 \t17.2 \t30.1 \t52.68 \t78.5\nSPC Iter 2 \t18.5 \t49 \t32.5 \t80.5\nSPC Iter 3 \t8.8 \t35.23 \t55.95 \t76.6\nSPC Iter 3* \t8.04 \t32.66 \t59.29 \tN/A\nSPC (LLM2) \t11.5 \t39 \t49.5 \tN/A\nTable 3: Turing Test on 200 Generated Conversations per Iteration: Synthetic-Persona-Chat Outcomes Against Persona-Chat.\n5 Related Work\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have been used for data augmentation Shin et al. (2021), generation Kim et al. (2023); Dong et al. (2023), and evaluation Zhang et al. (2019); Liu et al. (2023). One of the earliest works in this area Anaby-Tavor et al. (2019) used LLMs to create a large text dataset from a small, labeled one. This idea was followed by Wang et al. (2021); Schick and Sch\u00fctze (2021) which leveraged LLMs to create datasets without any human data. Kumar et al. (2020) evaluated the performance of different LLMs on the data augmentation task. Several conversational dataset generation methods focused on the structure of the conversational data Dai et al. (2022); Leszczynski et al. (2023); Abbasiantaeb et al. (2023). Mehri et al. (2022) illustrated how Large Language Models (LLMs) can effectively generate synthetic training data for task-oriented dialogue models.\n\nPersona-based conversations have been a popular research topic in NLP Liu et al. (2022). One of the earliest works in this area is Persona-Chat, by Zhang et al. (2018), which proposed the Persona-Chat dataset and evaluation metrics that have become a benchmark for persona-based conversation generation Mazar\u00e9 et al. (2018). Many subsequent works have used this dataset to train and evaluate their models, including DialoGPT Zhang et al. (2020), BlenderBot Shuster et al. (2022), and PersonaChatGen Lee et al. (2022). PersonaChatGen automated the process of creating persona based conversations of Persona-Chat using LLMs. A challenge in generating synthetic datasets is to ensure the quality of the conversation including data faithfulness, fidelity, diversity, and consistency Li et al. (2016); Lee et al. (2023); Veselovsky et al. (2023); Zhuo et al. (2023); Wang et al. (2023a); M\u00fcndler et al. (2023). Several works have focused on creating and using high quality training datasets Welleck et al. (2019), and creating quality filtering components to their conversation dataset generation Lewkowycz et al. (2022). Evaluation of the resulting conversational datasets is also challenging Xu et al. (2021). Wang et al. (2023b) recently introduced the paradigm of interactive evaluation of conversations with LLMs.\n6 Conclusion and Future Work\n\nWe developed a novel framework for generating high-quality persona-based conversations using LLMs, resulting in the creation of Synthetic-Persona-Chat, comprising 20k conversations. We hope this dataset will support future endeavors in developing persona-aware conversational agents, including the generation of domain-specific multi-session conversations for specialized, task-oriented interactions. While we focused on a persona-based dataset generation task, our Generator-Critic approach can be generalized to other use cases, such as generating other specialized datasets, etc.\nLimitations\n\nIn this paper, we define an iterative process over LLMs to generate a dataset. Our method requires computational resources, and access to an LLM. The quality of the dataset is bounded by the LLM, since the quality critics are also using the same LLM, and we leave the iterative improvement of our critics as future work. The main limitation of this data generation framework is the inability to generate realistic conversations that do not have high quality, since we assume that both parties are fluent, that the conversation flow is perfectly consistent, and there is no unexpected event (e.g. an interruption by another person, connection loss, etc.) in the middle of the conversation. Another limitation of our method is the difficulty of incorporating less tangible persona traits, such as a sense of humor, or user attributes that require multiple conversation sessions to be reflected.\nEthics Statement\n\nThe approach of generating datasets based on some desired objective might be used to create harmful datasets, and train malicious models based on them, such as a biased dataset, or a hateful speech one Hartvigsen et al. (2022). On the other hand, these datasets and models can be used as filters in application tasks.\n\nWe used Amazon Mechanical Turk in our human experiments, and followed that platform\u2019s guidelines to protect the rights of human raters. The participation was voluntary, and the raters were informed of their rights at the beginning of the study. The platform implemented security measures to protect them, and prevent the disclosure of any Personal Identifiable Information about them. Furthermore, we offered higher than minimum standard wage compensation to avoid any exploitative practices.\n\nTo avoid having any toxic conversation in the final dataset, we also used several tools to remove any potentially toxic conversation. Details about these tools, and example removed samples are available in Appendix B.1.\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors would like to thank Kian Ahrabian, Eric Boxer, Luke Friedman, I\u00f1aki Iturrate, Kathy Meir-Hellstern, Filip Radlinski, and Kexuan Sun for their valuable comments on this manuscript.\nReferences\n\n    Abbasiantaeb et al.

We created Synthetic-Persona-Chat using an LLM with 24 billion parameters. We use top-k sampling with k=40 for decoding during generation, and set the temperature value to 0.7 in all components. We give more details on user and conversation generation components in the following subsections.\nA.1 User Generation\n\nIn our framework, the user generation component consists of two steps: expanding the persona attribute set, and creating realistic user profiles. In this section we provide details on our framework for these two steps:\nPersona Expansion\n\nAs described in Section 3.1.1, the persona expansion step involves identifying persona categories in the initial persona attribute set \u03a00, generating queries associated with those categories, and bootstrapping queries to create a query set Q. In our framework, we employ the Scikit-learn Pedregosa et al. (2011) implementation of an agglomerative clustering to identify persona categories following this clustering method: we represent each persona using a BERT-based representation. Our clustering approach is bottom-up, starting with each persona attribute as an individual cluster. At each step, we combine two clusters if their similarity exceeds a predetermined threshold of 0.1. The similarity of two clusters is measured using inter-cluster average cosine similarity. The process continues until no pair of clusters is more similar than the threshold.\n\nAfter identifying the clusters, we sample 3 instances of persona attributes for each cluster, and prompt the LLM using the template in shown in section 3 to construct an initial query set Q0. We expand the query set Q0 using bootstrapping. At each step, we sample 5 instances from the available queries, and prompt the LLM using the template in Table 6. We repeat this process for 100 steps. Examples of initial persona attributes, induced queries, bootstrapped queries, and bootstrapped persona attributes can be found in Table 4. The prompt templates used in this component are available in Table 6.\nUser Profile Generation\n\nWe illustrate a sample user profile creation process in Figure 6. As shown in the figure, at each iteration, a randomly selected persona attribute is checked for consistency and non-redundancy.\n\nLet \u03c0\u2032 be a randomly selected persona attribute in an iteration. For the redundancy criteria, we use the BERT representation of persona attributes. We compute the similarity of the new candidate persona attribute \u03c0\u2032 with every persona attribute in the user profile. If it is more than a threshold (0.9 in these experiments) similar to an attribute in the user profile, \u03c0\u2032 is deemed as redundant and will not be added to the user profile. We use the cosine similarities of the BERT representations of the persona attributes.\n\nFor the consistency criteria, we use the NLI model to verify the consistency of this persona attribute with the user profile. For every persona attribute in the current user profile \u03c0, we prompt the LLM to create the negated persona attribute \u00ac\u2062\u03c0. Then, we query the NLI model to check whether \u00ac\u2062\u03c0 is inferred by \u03c0\u2032 or \u00ac\u2062\u03c0\u2032 is inferred by \u03c0. If either of these cases is inferred, then the selected persona attribute is not consistent with the user profile, and not added to the profile.\n\nDataset\n\t\n\nPersona Source\n\t\n\nQuery\n\t\n\nExample Persona Attribute\n\nPersona-Chat\n\tHuman \t\n\nWhat is your job?\n\t\n\nI am a pharmacist.\n\nWhere do you live?\n\t\n\nI live close to the coast.\n\nDo you have any pets?\n\t\n\nI have a doberman.\nLLM \t\n\nWhat are your talents?\n\t\n\nI am a great listener.\n\nWhat is your hair color?\n\t\n\nMy hair is auburn.\n\nWhat is your favorite song?\n\t\n\nI like the song \"Leather and Lace\".\n\nWikipedia\n\tHuman \t\n\nWhat are your hobbies?\n\t\n\nI spend WAY too much time on Wikipedia.\n\nWhat is your view on the metric system?\n\t\n\nI find the metric system to be a logical and efficient way to measure things.\nLLM \t\n\nWhat is the name of the first album you ever purchased?\n\t\n\nMy first album was The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\n\nWhat are you interested in?\n\t\n\nI\u2019m looking to learn new recipes and improve my cooking skills.\nTable 4: Persona Categories and Induced Queries Using Our Framework. Queries are generated by the Large Language Model (LLM). Queries for personas with the \"LLM\" as source, are generated through bootstrapping, while those with \"human\" as source are generated by sampling persona categories and prompting the LLM. Personas with \"human\" as the source are authored by humans, while \"LLM\" rows represent personas generated using our framework.\nRefer to caption\nFigure 6: User Profile Construction Example\nA.2 Conversation Generation\nLLM-based Critic\n\nIn our framework, the critic is implemented by prompting an LLM. We included a mixture of experts approach in the critic, where each expert prompts the LLM to assess a specific policy in the candidate conversations. Our framework includes a set of experts to control the general conversation quality. We evaluate the performance of these experts using a baseline dataset. The baseline dataset for this experiment is FED which consists of 125 human-annotated instances evaluated at the conversation level. We pair the conversations and evaluate the experts based on the number of correctly ranked pairs. As shown in Table 5, we observe that these experts are more than 80% accurate in distinguishing the better conversation within the pairs. The template for the verbalized form of these experts used in our framework can be found in Table 6.\nPolicy \tPerformance\nDepth \t0.84\nCoherency \t0.96\nConsistency \t0.92\nDiversity \t0.92\nLikable \t0.88\nTable 5: List of FED Experts for Persona-Based Conversation Generation Critic.

Variables enclosed in {} are filled when the template is populated.\n\nWe also included a toxicity expert and a persona faithfulness expert in the critic. The prompt templates used in these experts are available in Table 6. The persona faithfulness leverages in-context- learning capability of LLMs. It includes a few human-curated examples of faithful and unfaithful conversations in the instruction prompt. Refer to Table 7 for examples of faithful and unfaithful conversations used in the instruction prompt.\n\nUser Profiles\n\t\n\nConversations\n\t\n\nFaithfulness Explanation\n\nUser 1:\nOne of my favorite hobbies is gaming.\nI currently work in an office.\nI enjoy running\n\nUser 2:\nI am applying for publishing jobs.\nMy mother is a librarian.\nThe only autographs I\u2019ve ever wanted are from authors.\nI used to wear glasses as a child.\nMy favorite color is green.\n\t\n\nUser 1: Do you like video games?\n\nUser 2: No, I do not like video games.\n\nUser 1: What do you do for a living?\n\nUser 2: I am a librarian.\n\nUser 1: I guess that is why you like to read a lot.\n\nUser 2: Yes, I like to read books.\n\nUser 1: What is your favorite color?

An example Synthetic-Persona-Chat conversation can be found in Table 8. We compare Synthetic-Persona-Chat to Persona-Chat across different dimensions. We first assess the characteristics of SPC using various automatic evaluators, i.e. evaluators which do not require human effort. We then conduct a human evaluation experiment on a subset of SPC.\n\nUser Profiles\n\t\n\nConversation\n\nUser 1\n\nI am male.\n\nMy weakness are sweets.\n\nI am unsociable.\n\nI am a jack of all, master of none.\n\nUser 2\n\nMy favorite music is rock and roll.\n\nI love to travel.\n\nI am from Russia.\n\nI enjoy skiing.\n\nI go to school for business.\n\t\n\nUser 1: Hello\n\nUser 2: Hello, what\u2019s your name?\n\nUser 1: My name is [name], and you?\n\nUser 2: My name is [name], I\u2019m from Russia.\n\nUser 1: Nice to meet you, [name].

This conversation was synthesized from user profiles in Persona-Chat\nB.1 Automatic Evaluation\n\nWe conduct a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of SPC across different dimensions and compare it against PC. We start by analyzing the toxicity and diversity of SPC using off the shelf tools. Then, we elaborate on the experiments which assess the efficacy of SPC used as the dataset for the next utterance prediction and the profile extraction tasks. Finally, we evaluate the quality of SPC conversations using LLM-based evaluation methods.\nToxicity Analysis\n\nWe analyze the toxicity of the generated conversations at the final iteration of SPC using an online tool called Perspective3\n3\nhttps://perspectiveapi.com/. We reproduce the results of a detailed analysis of toxicity in PC as well as in each iteration of our data generation framework while producing SPC in Table 9.\n\t\tToxicity \t\t\tProfanity \t\nConfidence \tweak(< .2) \tmedium(.2-.8) \tstrong(>.8) \tweak(< .2) \tmedium(.2-.8) \tstrong(>.8)\nPC \t10875 \t4448 \t53 \t10891 \t1676 \t57\nSPC Iter 1 \t10902 \t1192 \t3 \t10903 \t340 \t3\nSPC Iter 2 \t10900 \t1096 \t1 \t10901 \t345 \t1\nSPC Iter 3 \t10902 \t1088 \t1 \t10902 \t376 \t0\nTable 9: Frequency of Toxic Conversations in Persona-Chat and Synthetic-Persona-Chat\n\nWe observe a notable reduction in the frequency of conversations deemed as strongly toxic or profane throughout the iterations of generating SPC. This reduction can be attributed to the built-in toxicity filter of the employed LLM. While PC contains more than 50 samples that are identified as strongly toxic, SPC includes at most three toxic or profane conversations, which is significantly lower (at least 15 times less). Interestingly, the fraction of conversations with medium profanity and toxicity in SPC is 4 times less than the same type of conversations in PC across all iterations. We have removed any conversation that was marked as strongly toxic by this tool in the released dataset. Samples of toxic conversations are provided in Table 10.\n\nSource\n\t\n\nConversation\n\nPersona-Chat\n\t\n\n\u2026\nUser 1: I like bloody stuff.\nUser 2: It reminds me of the dark which makes me afraid of it.\nUser 1: You are a silly goose.\n\nPersona-Chat\n\t\n\n\u2026\nUser 2: Cool. Why do you say that? Because I am a red head?\nUser 1: No. Ikn. Why do you ask so many questions? Mr. Thomas is dumb.\n\nSynthetic-Persona-Chat\n\t\n\nUser 1: I can imagine. What\u2019s your favorite part of the job?\nUser 2: I love working with my team and seeing our restaurant succeed.\nUser 1: That\u2019s great. What\u2019s your least favorite part of the job?\nUser2: My least favorite part is dealing with my boss. He\u2019s a real jerk.\nTable 10: Examples of Toxic Conversations. The first two examples are segments of conversations from Persona-Chat. The final example is a segment from a toxic conversation in Synthetic-Persona-Chat, which has been removed in the released dataset.\nDiversity Analysis\n\nWe use hierarchical topic modeling Blei et al. (2004) to assess the topic diversity of SPC and compare it to that of PC. For a fair comparison, we only compare conversations in SPC with similar personas in PC. Table 11 displays the number of topics at each level of the topic tree, with the first level indicating the most general topic. We observe similar topic diversity at the first level. In deeper levels, there is a slightly lower diversity in SPC.\nTopic Level \tPC \tSPC\n1 \t27 \t27\n2 \t232 \t213\n3 \t470 \t403\n4 \t137 \t118\n5 \t30 \t26\nTable 11: Vertical Topic Diversity in Persona-based Datasets\nNext Utterance Prediction\n\nWe compare the performance of different models on the next utterance prediction task. As discussed in Section 4.2, these models are expected to exhibit better performance in the next utterance prediction task when user personas are provided as prior information. We evaluate ranking and generative models for response selection to assess this property. We compare models trained on SPC to the same models trained on PC. We use the implementations provided in Miller et al. (2017) for the following models:\n\n    \u2022\n\n    IR Baseline Given an utterance as a query, the IR baseline finds the most similar utterance in the training corpus using tf-idf. It defines the utterance after the most similar utterance as the candidate response, and then returns the most similar option to that candidate as the output.\n    \u2022\n\n    Transformer-Ranker The context of the conversation, as well as the candidate next utterances, are encoded using a BERT-based encoder. The most similar encoded candidate to the conversation context, as measured by a dot-product in their representation space, is selected as the output Humeau et al. (2020).\n    \u2022\n\n    Transformer-Generator This model is a sequence-to-sequence model Sutskever et al. (2014) which uses transformers as encoders and decoders.\n    \t\tPersona-Chat \tSynthetic-Persona-Chat\n    Method \tMetric \tNo Persona \tSelf Persona \tTheir Persona \tBoth Personas \tNo Persona \tSelf Persona \tTheir Persona \tBoth Personas\n    IR baseline \thit@1 \t0.1869 \t0.3683 \t0.1519 \t0.3281 \t0.1861 \t0.2596 \t0.1882 \t0.2493\n    Transformer(Ranker) \thit@1 \t0.2513 \t0.275 \t0.1922 \t0.2572 \t0.7164 \t0.6227 \t0.6988 \t0.7214\n    Transformer \thit@1 \t0.0896 \t0.08512 \t0.0873 \t0.0813 \t0.0526 \t0.629 \t0.053 \t0.051\n    (Generator) \tppl \t65.57 \t72.24 \t62.49 \t64.07 \t5.54 \t5.47 \t5.4 \t5.405\n    Table 12: Evaluation of Next Utterance Prediction models conditioned on different user personas.\n\nWe also evaluate the performance of the next utterance prediction models when given no user, one user, and both user personas. The results of this experiment are available in Table 12. We observe that the highest performance improvement for all models trained on PC is when self-personas are given as input. We do not observe such a pattern in SPC. This indicates a higher degree of bidirectionality in SPC conversations compared to those of PC.\nProfile Extraction\n\nA potential use-case of the SPC dataset is training a model to predict user personas from a conversation. This is only possible if the dataset is highly faithful, meaning that any persona attribute inferred from the conversation is in the user profile or compatible with the user profile. In this context, a faithful conversation is expected to have high precision in the profile extraction task, while a conversation that highly reflects user personas is expected to have high recall in this task.\n\nWe evaluate the task of user profile extraction for conversations in SPC, and compare the results against those of PC. We frame the task of profile extraction as a ranking task, using the utterances within the conversations as queries. The goal is to rank a set of persona attribute options. For each conversation, we include the speakers\u2019 persona attributes in the available options. Additionally, we select 25 random user persona attributes from other speaker profiles within the dataset to serve as distractors. The input to the profile extraction is utterances from a single user as the speaker, while the output is a list of persona attribute options for a target user, which could be either user 1 or user 2. The results of this experiment are presented in Table 13. We observe that the performance of the profile extraction methods is higher in SPC in 3 of the 4 scenarios. Interestingly, we observe that with both datasets, when the target and the speaker are different, the performance of profile extraction is greater compared to the cases when the target and speaker users are the same.\n\t\tF-Score\nTarget \tSpeaker \tPC \tSPC\nuser 1 \tuser 1 \t0.505 \t0.574\nuser 1 \tuser 2 \t0.737 \t0.68\nuser 2 \tuser 1 \t0.50 \t0.57\nuser 2 \tuser 2 \t0.456 \t0.494\nTable 13: Accuracy of Profile Extraction in Four Different Scenarios. The \u2018Target\u2019 column represents the user profile to be extracted, while the \u2018Speaker\u2019 column indicates the speaker of the turns given to the model as input.\nLLM-based Quality Evaluation\n\nWe leverage LLM-based conversation quality evaluators from the literature to compare the quality of SPC and PC. These evaluators rely on the human curated prompt templates for different metrics including consistency, fluency, etc. We used these evaluators with minimum change in the original prompt templates. These evaluators are:\n\n    \u2022\n\n    LLM-Eval Lin and Chen (2023) is a multi-dimensional automatic evaluation designed for conversations. It uses a human-curated prompt which describes evaluation dimensions, serving as a unified evaluation schema. This prompt evaluates the conversation across multiple dimensions (e.g. fluency) in a single model call. We show this unified schema in Table 14.\n    \u2022\n\n    GPT-Score Fu et al. (2023) leverages emergent abilities of LLMs, i.e. zero-shot instructions, to score texts. It contains a prompt template, and for each quality criterion, populates the template with a human description of the criteria along with the valid score range for that criteria. Example prompts are provided in Table 14.\n    \u2022\n\n    G-Eval Liu et al. (2023) introduces a framework that employs LLMs with a chain-of-thought approach to assess the quality of natural language generated outputs. For any evaluation criteria, G-Eval prompts the LLM with the criterion\u2019s description, prompting the model to generate the necessary evaluation steps. It then uses these steps to prompt the LLM to score given output for that criterion. It considers the probability of getting each permissible score as the output of the prompt, i.e., it considers the probability distribution of scores assigned by the LLM. The reported output is the expected value of the score distribution by the LLM. Table 14 includes an example prompt.\n\nEvaluator\n\t\n\nMetric\n\t\n\nPrompt Template\n\nLLM-Eval\n\t\n\nAll\n\t\n\nHuman: The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}} the object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema.

We conduct a Turing test, and a faithfulness study - both of which we describe in more details in the following subsections - at the end of every iteration of the generation of SPC.\nTuring Test\n\nWe randomly select 200 user pairs from PC. For each example, we show the annotators the user pair, together with the corresponding conversations from PC and SPC, and ask them to select the conversation that was synthetically generated. We show an example of this crowdsourcing task in Figure 7. The results of the Turing test are available in Table 16. We report the losing rate of SPC in Turing test, and Fleiss\u2019 Kappa to assess the inter-rater agreement. The agreement falls into the fair to moderate agreement bucket.\nRefer to caption\nFigure 7: Preview of the Turing Test Task on the Crowdsourcing Platform\nConversation Source \t% Lose \t\u03ba \t# annotators\nSPC Iter 1 \t17.2 \t0.41 \t50\nSPC Iter 2 \t18.5 \t0.48 \t40\nSPC Iter 3 \t8.8 \t0.22 \t11\nSPC Iter 3* \t8.04 \t0.56 \t24\nSPC (LLM2) \t11.5 \t0.49 \t36\nTable 16: Turing test results on a sample of 200 conversations. The first column shows the percentage of SPC losing compared to PC in the Turing test. Note that the last iteration (3) of SPC is an evaluation of the segment of conversations based on the extended persona set.\nFaithfulness\n\nWe present the annotators with a conversation, and a set of options of persona attributes. The annotators are asked to select the user persona attributes they would infer from the conversation. Figure 8 shows a sample of the annotation task in this study. The options include the persona attributes of the speakers in the conversation, and a set of distractor persona attributes. We created distractor persona attributes using different strategies to cover different difficulty levels. For a persona attribute set \u03a0, we create a set \u00ac\u2062\u03a0 of distractor persona attributes as:\n\nNegated personas We prompt an LLM to negate persona attributes. For example, the negation of persona attribute \"I like vegetables\" is \"I don\u2019t like vegetables\".\n\nRandom personas We randomly select persona attributes from user profiles in other conversations in the dataset.\n\nContradicting personas We prompt an LLM to generate a persona attribute which contradicts the users\u2019 personas.\n\nEach entry of this task includes 8 user persona attributes as options, where 4 of them are the real persona attributes, and the other 4 are distractors. We evaluate the precision of the human annotators, and report it as a proxy to the conversation faithfulness in Table 3.\nRefer to caption\nFigure 8: Preview of the Faithfulness Task on the Crowdsourcing Platform.\nAppendix C Ablation Studies\n\nWe run several ablation studies to evaluate the importance of individual components in our framework. We begin by analyzing the effect of the persona expansion module. We then review the impact of each expert in the mixture forming our Critic.\nC.1 Persona Expansion\n\nWe assess the importance of the query-based persona expansion module introduced in Section 3.1.1. Similarly to the experiment outlined in Section 4.1, we run the persona expansion on two datasets: Wikipedia and PC. The results of this experiment are presented in Table 17. We designate the persona expansions without the inducted query set (Q) as \u2018Wikipedia-0\u2019, and \u2018PC-0\u2019, and run the same number of iterations for each (100 iterations). We observe that PC-0 includes 4,477 new persona attributes, 20 percent less than PC. The difference in the number of newly generated persona attributes is more pronounced in the case of Wikipedia, where Wikipedia-0 consists of 4,742 persona attributes, 50 percent less than Wikipedia+. This trend is also observed in the number of persona clusters, with PC-0 and Wikipedia-0 having 6% and 49% less clusters respectively. This pattern suggests the effectiveness of the query-based persona expansion in maintaining the diversity of the persona set. Furthermore, the average persona attribute length in PC-0 is 11.38 tokens, which is 28% less than SPC. This reduction points to less detailed and specific persona attributes. In contrast, the expansion in \u2018Wikipedia-0\u2019 exhibits similar average persona attribute lengths compared to \u2018Wikipedia+\u2019.\nDataset \tPC \tSPC \tPC-0 \tWikipedia \tWikipedia+ \tWikipedia-0\n# Persona Attributes \t4,723 \t10,371 \t9,200 \t8,768 \t18,293 \t13,510\n# Clusters \t323 \t553 \t520 \t408 \t986 \t502\nInterCluster-Dist \t0.836 \t0.863 \t0.842 \t0.816 \t0.85 \t0.83\nAVG length \t7.65 \t15.9* \t11.38* \t10.45 \t15.2* \t15.2*\nTable 17: Evaluation of the Expanded Persona Attribute Sets. The numbers with *\u2032\u2032 indicate the metric value on the newly generated persona attributes, in contrast to the initial persona attributes.\nC.2 Conversation Quality\n\nWe analyze the effect of the experts within our Critic. We remove each expert, and generate a dataset using one iteration of our framework. We compare the resulting datasets against the output of the first iteration of SPC. We use the evaluators introduced in B.1. The results of this experiment are summarized in Table 15. We observe that the exclusion of the experts results in worse performance according to most criteria: 3 out of 4 in LLM-Eval, 4 out of 6 in GPT-Score, and 3 out of 5 in G-Eval.\nC.3 Faithfulness\n\nWe ablate the faithfulness critic, and generate a dataset that we compare against SPC. We compare these datasets both automatically, using human annotators (Turing Test), and using a prompted LLM (LLM-Evaluator). We describe this study in more details below.\nTuring Test\n\nWe run a human study to compare a small subset of conversations created without the faithfulness expert against their equivalent created with that expert. This experiment process is similar to 4.3 and it is conducted for 200 conversations. The precision decreases from 78.0% to 66.0% without this critic, highlighting its effectiveness in eliminating conversations with contradictory information about user personas. The recall decreases from 36.0% to 23.0%, demonstrating a higher reflection of personas in the conversations in the presence of the faithfulness expert.\nLLM-Evaluator\n\nWe extend our comparison to the entire dataset using an LLM as an annotator, following He et al. (2023); Bansal and Sharma (2023); Chiang and yi Lee (2023). Table 18 shows the faithfulness of the conversations generated in the first iteration without the faithfulness expert. The templates used in the LLM-based annotators are described in Table 15 in the rows with \"LLM-Faithfulness\" as their evaluator. Note that the annotator-based LLM is created using a different LLM, gpt-3.5-turbo Brown et al. (2020a); Ouyang et al. (2022), than the LLM used for dataset generation.\n\tLLM Evaluator (%) \tHuman Evaluator (%)\nAbsent Component \tInference \tContradiction \tPrecision \tRecall\nNone \t33.2 \t24.5 \t78.5 \t36.4\nFaithfulness \t32.7 \t28.8 \t66.1 \t23.1\nFED \t31.7 \t28.5 \tN/A \tN/A\nTable 18: Faithfulness of Generated Conversation Datasets Using the Framework While Eliminating Each Component. The first row represents the framework without removing any component, equivalent to the first iteration of Synthetic-Persona-Chat.\nC.4 Next Utterance Prediction\n\nWe follow the experimental setting described in section 4.2, and compare the performance of various next utterance prediction models trained on SPC against the same models trained on datasets created in the absence of certain experts.\n\nWhen using the IR Baseline as the next utterance prediction method, we observee that its highest performance of 39% hit@1 occurs when the FED critic is absent during dataset creation. This outcome aligns with FED\u2019s emphasis on conversation quality, excluding persona-related aspects. Conversely, the Transformer Ranker, capable of understanding intricate concepts, achieves its peak performance of 13.9% hit@1 when none of the experts are absent. This result supports the inclusion of both FED and the Faithfulness expert in the model architecture. In generative models, the absence of FED impacts the next utterance prediction model the most, leading to a notable decline in performance (e.g. \u221212% hit@1, \u22129% BLEU, \u221210% ROUGE). This observation underscores the crucial role played by FED in enhancing the generative capabilities of the model.\nAbsent Component \tFaithfulness \tFED \tNone\nMethod \tMetric \tNone \tPersona \t% Change \tNone \tPersona \t% Change \tNone \tPersona \t% Change\nIR Baseline \thit@1 \t18.7 \t38.7 \t+106 \t19.0 \t39.0 \t+105 \t18.9 \t38.7 \t+105\nTransformer (Ranker) \thit@1 \t10.9 \t13.5 \t+24 \t10.7 \t13.6 \t+27 \t12.4 \t13.9 \t+11\n\thit@1 \t8.9 \t7.4 \t-16 \t8.4 \t7.4 \t-12 \t8.2 \t7.0 \t-14\nTransformer \tPerplexity \t204 \t214 \t+5 \t174 \t185 \t+6 \t203 \t210 \t+3\n(Generator) \tBLUE \t0.11 \t0.10 \t-11 \t0.11 \t0.10 \t-9 \t0.10 \t0.08 \t-15\n\tROUGE \t0.14 \t0.15 \t-12 \t0.14 \t0.12 \t-10 \t0.13 \t0.10 \t-17\nTable 19: Results of the Next Utterance Prediction Experiment in the Ablation Study.

One way to foster deeper interactions between a chatbot and its user is through personas, aspects of the user\u2019s character that provide insights into their personality, motivations, and behaviors. Training Natural Language Processing (NLP) models on a diverse and comprehensive persona-based dataset can lead to conversational models that create a deeper connection with the user, and maintain their engagement. In this paper, we leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a large, high-quality conversational dataset from a seed dataset. We propose a Generator-Critic architecture framework to expand the initial dataset, while improving the quality of its conversations. The Generator is an LLM prompted to output conversations. The Critic consists of a mixture of expert LLMs that control the quality of the generated conversations. These experts select the best generated conversations, which we then use to improve the Generator. We release Synthetic-Persona-Chat1\n1\nDataset available at https://github.com/google-research-datasets/Synthetic-Persona-Chat, consisting of 20k conversations seeded from Persona-Chat Zhang et al. (2018). We evaluate the quality of Synthetic-Persona-Chat and our generation framework on different dimensions through extensive experiments, and observe that the losing rate of Synthetic-Persona-Chat against Persona-Chat during Turing test decreases from 17.2% to 8.8% over three iterations.\n1 Introduction\n\nEvery person is a story. Systems that interact with people must understand their underlying stories to effectively engage with them. Unfortunately, many existing datasets used for training conversational agents do not sufficiently model their users. Personas - abstract user representations that express the \u201cstory\u201d of a person based on their background and preferences - have been widely used for human-centered design in a variety of domains, including marketing, system design, and healthcare Pruitt and Grudin (2003b). Prior persona-based conversational datasets, like Persona-Chat (PC) Zhang et al. (2018), suffer from several limitations, such as small size, static dialogues that cannot easily be updated with new topics, irrelevant utterances, and contradictory persona attributes Wu et al. (2019). In this paper, we propose a novel framework for generating large, dynamic, persona-based conversational datasets that capture the breadth and depth of human experience.\n\nPersonas Pruitt and Grudin (2003a); Cooper and Saffo (1999) have been widely used in a variety of domains and applications, including creating narratives for patients and sharing educational messages in healthcare Massey et al. (2021), targeting users in marketing van Pinxteren et al. (2020); Fuglerud et al. (2020), and communicating with workers in management Claus (2019). Conversational agents use personas to generate more interesting and engaging conversations with their users Zhou et al. (2019); Shum et al. (2019).\n\nCreating persona-based datasets is difficult: the process is labor-intensive, the outputs must be updated to reflect current events and new concepts, and there are often quality concerns. Existing persona-based datasets have resulted from labor-intensive data collection processes Zhang et al. (2018); Zhong et al. (2020) involving humans to create or validate personas, create fictional persona-based conversations, and ensure the conversations are coherent. Moreover, even after these datasets are created, it is difficult to update them with the latest topics Lee et al. (2022), such as current events, new concepts, products, or social trends Lazaridou et al. (2021). Finally, existing persona-based datasets do not guarantee faithfulness, a criterion we introduce to describe the alignment between participants\u2019 utterances and their personas.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce a new framework for generating large, customized persona-based conversational datasets that uses unsupervised LLMs to reduce human labor, introduces methods to generate, expand, and update personas automatically, and enforces a set of quality criteria including faithfulness to ensure dialogues are human-like. Our persona-based conversational dataset generation framework consists of a three-level pipeline:\n\n    1.\n\n    User Generation\n    2.\n\n    User Pairing\n    3.\n\n    Conversation Generation\n\nThe user generation step takes a set of seed personas, and augments it to create plausible user profiles. The user pairing step matches users to participate in conversations. The conversation generation produces plausible conversations between the selected user pairs. The conversation generation component uses a method similar to self-feedback Madaan et al. (2023) to iteratively improve the quality of generated samples.\n\nWe used the proposed framework to create Synthetic-Persona-Chat (SPC), a conversational dataset with 5\u2062k user personas, and 20\u2062k faithful dialogues. The framework we defined to create this dataset can be reused to define specialized personas, such as user music profiles, etc. to create application-specific datasets.\n\nOur contributions are:\n\n    \u2022\n\n    We propose an unsupervised approach to generate, and extend specialized personas using LLMs.\n    \u2022\n\n    We introduce and evaluate a framework based on LLMs to evolve a dataset while imposing different objectives on it.\n    \u2022\n\n    We release Synthetic-Persona-Chat, a high-quality, faithful, persona-based conversational dataset useful for several conversational tasks, such as training persona inference models.\n\n2 Definitions\n\nWe define the faithful persona-based dialogue generation task. We begin by defining the persona-based dialogue generation task. We then formally define the faithfulness criteria as a desired quality for the generated dialogues. Throughout this section, we use \u03c0 to refer to persona attributes (individual sentences which, together, form the user persona), U to refer to user profiles, and D to refer to conversations (dialogues).\n\nPersona Attributes We define a user persona attribute as a sentence describing this user. \"I like ice cream\", \"I have two brothers\" and \"My native language is Tamazight\" are all examples of persona attributes. Let \u03a9 be the universal set of persona attributes. \u03a9 contains all natural language descriptions of all tangible features of any person, which is unbounded.\n\nPersona Categories To help organize the vast space of personas, we adopt the approach of Lee et al. (2022) who introduced persona categories. Persona categories are groups of persona attributes that describe the same semantic feature of the user. In our work, we associate each persona category with a corresponding query that can be answered with all persona attributes in that category. For example, job and family situation are persona categories, and corresponding queries might be \u201cWhat is your occupation?\u201d, and \u201cDo you have a family?\u201d.\n\nPersona Attribute Structure Persona attributes can overlap. For instance, the attribute \"I introduced my kids to scuba diving at a young age\" overlaps with the attribute \"My eldest son goes to elementary school\", since both include the \"parenthood\" feature of the user. Moreover, some persona attributes form a hierarchy, and some persona attributes are specific cases of other attributes.\n\nUser Profile We define a user profile as a set of persona attributes that can be used to describe a user. For a realistic user, the persona attributes describing a user profile should not contradict each other, and be consistent. An arbitrary persona attribute set U\u2282\u03a9 is a consistent set of persona attribute if, and only if:\n\t\n\u2200\u03c01\u2208U,\u2204\u2062\u03a02\u2282U:(\u03a02\u2260\u2205)\u2227(\u03a02\u2192\u00ac\u2062\u03c01)\n\t\n\nPersona-based Conversation A persona-based conversation D contains utterances such that at least one persona attribute from each user profile can be inferred from it. For example, the persona attribute \"I am a parent\" can be inferred from the utterance \"I just dropped off my son at school\". A persona-based conversation model is a generative model that takes a pair of user profiles (U1, U2) as input, and returns a persona-based dialogue D between these two users.\n\nFaithfulness One crucial quality for a persona-based conversation is that it should align with the user profile. Inspired by Daheim et al. (2023) which introduces dialogue system faithfulness to the knowledge contained in relevant documents, we specify the criterion of faithfulness to characterize the alignment between the utterances of a user in a persona-based conversation and their profile. The faithfulness criterion enforces the constraint that the utterances of a user should not decrease the likelihood of their persona. This criterion assumes the existence of both a prior probability of persona attributes, and an inference model for determining the probability of persona attributes conditioned on utterances. Let M be such an inference model, (U1, U2) a pair of user profiles, and D a persona-based conversation between them. To be a faithful conversation based on M, D should not contain any contradicting evidence to the persona attributes of the speakers: passing the conversation D as input to the inference model M should not reduce the inference probability of persona attributes in either of the user profiles U1 or U2. In other words, the probability of any persona attribute in the user profiles based on conversation D should not be less than the probability of that persona attribute without any assumptions. Formally, we call a conversation D faithful with respect to the user profiles U1 and U2, and inference model M if the following condition holds: \u2200\u03c0\u2208U1\u222aU2:PM\u2062(\u03c0|D)\u2265PM\u2062(\u03c0). Where PM\u2062(\u03c0|D) indicates the probability that M infers the persona \u03c0 given conversation D. We show examples of faithful, and unfaithful conversations in Figure 1.\nRefer to caption\nFigure 1: Unfaithful Conversation (Left): Loving steak is negatively correlated with the persona attribute \"I am a vegetarian\". Faithful Conversation (Right): It introduces no information that contradicts or weakens the user\u2019s profile.\n3 Method\n\nIn this section, we introduce our method to generate persona-based conversations. We create such conversations with minimum human input, starting from an initial dataset. Our process consists of three steps, as shown in Figure 2: user generation, user pairing, and conversation generation. The first component augments a set of seed persona attributes \u03a00 into an expanded set of persona attributes \u03a0e, from which it creates user profiles. The second component pairs user profiles as interlocutors of a conversation. The third and final component uses an iterative process to generate high-quality conversations among user profile pairs. We detail each of these components below.\nRefer to caption\nFigure 2: Dataset Augmentation Pipeline\n3.1 User Generation\n\nThe User Generation component is split into two sub-components:\n\n    1.\n\n    Persona Expansion\n    2.\n\n    User Profile Construction\n\nWe bootstrap seed persona attributes by using various prompts Brown et al. (2020b) to generate new persona attributes in the Persona Expansion step (Refer to Appendix A.1 for more details on the prompts used). We then create new user profiles by iteratively selecting random user persona attributes from the expanded persona attributes. We employ a Natural Language Inference (NLI) model to ensure the consistency of the constructed user profiles.\n3.1.1 Persona Expansion\n\nWe propose an unsupervised method to augment a set of seed persona attributes \u03a00 into a super-set \u03a0e. Unlike previous approaches Lee et al. (2022), our method is independent of human knowledge or intervention, making it capable of creating specialized personas in new domains. We proceed in two steps: query induction, and persona bootstrapping. In the query induction phase, we identify persona categories in \u03a00, along with associated queries. We then expand these queries into a set Q that also covers unobserved persona categories. The persona bootstrapping step leverages the category-based query set Q, and the initial persona attribute seed set \u03a00 to generate new persona attributes. Both of these steps are based on the bootstrapping technique Yarowsky (1995), and involve prompting an LLM. We provide a detailed description of these two steps in the following.\n\nQuery Induction As described in Section 2, each persona attribute belongs to at least one persona category, and each category is associated with a corresponding query that can be answered with persona attributes in that category. The query induction process initially identifies the queries associated with persona categories in \u03a00. It then bootstraps queries by feeding them to a prompted LLM to create more queries that are associated with unobserved categories, ultimately creating a query set Q. Including queries associated with unobserved persona categories facilitates the creation of a more diverse set of personas, and increases the scale of augmentation.\n\nThe query induction relies on the following assumption:\n\nAssumption Let \u2133 be an LLM, and let \u0393 be the set of all queries associated with all persona categories. If two persona attributes \u03c01 and \u03c02 belong to the same persona category, then there exists a query q\u2133\u2208\u0393 such that \u03c01 and \u03c02 are \u2133\u2019s output to q\u2133.\n\nThe persona attributes \"I am a doctor\" and \"I am a truck driver\", for instance, both belong to the \"job\" category, leading to the query \"What is your job?\". We use an agglomerative clustering method to identify the persona categories in \u03a00. Let C be an arbitrary persona cluster in \u03a00. To generate a query for C, we select a random subset of persona attributes in C, and create a prompt using these samples. We employ this strategy to generate queries for all the clusters identified in \u03a00, and create a set of queries, which we refer to as Q0. Details on the clustering, query induction, together with examples of clusters, persona attributes, and induced queries are available in Appendix A.1. We come up with queries for new, unobserved persona categories by bootstrapping the queries in Q0: starting from Q=Q0, we iteratively sample a set of queries from Q, and create a prompt by concatenating them. We then prompt the LLM to generate a new query, and add it to the query set Q, as shown in Figure 3. We generated a total of |Q|=188 queries. This set of category-specific queries Q is later used to guide the LLM to generate new persona attributes from the specified category. Thus, higher values of |Q| result in greater diversity within the expanded persona attribute set.\nRefer to caption\nFigure 3: Query Induction Steps\n\nPersona Bootstrapping We use the persona attribute seed set \u03a00 and category-specific queries Q to generate new persona attributes through a bootstrapping process. We initialize \u03a0 to \u03a00. At every iteration, we randomly select a subset of persona attributes from \u03a0, and create a set of prompts as follows: we first concatenate a set of persona attributes s. For every query q\u2208Q, we then combine the concatenated samples s, and the query q to create a category-specific persona prompt. This prompt guides the LLM to generate a persona attribute for that persona category. The set of prompts obtained from this process is {s\u2062q|q\u2208Q}. We only add a new persona attribute to the set if its BERT embeddings Devlin et al. (2019) are not too close from existing ones, so as to prevent the addition of duplicates.\n\nEach of these prompts is then fed to the LLM to create a new persona attribute, which is subsequently added to the set of persona attributes \u03a0 for the next iteration. We continue this iterative process until we have generated a total of 5k persona attributes. Figure 4 illustrates the persona bootstrapping process. Table 6 in the appendix contains the prompt template used in this component.\nRefer to caption\nFigure 4: Query-based Persona Bootstrapping Process\n3.1.2 User Profile Construction\n\nWe build user profiles incrementally by sampling persona attributes from \u03a0e, and adding the eligible ones. A persona attribute is eligible if it adheres to the criteria of consistency and non-redundancy. In other words, it should not contradict any attribute already in the user profile, and it should not be inferred by other persona attribute. We assess the consistency and redundancy of user profiles by leveraging an NLI model, and persona attribute clustering, respectively. The NLI model we employ is based on T5 Raffel et al. (2019), and has been trained on the TRUE dataset Honovich et al. (2022).\n\nWe create a user profile U by iteratively selecting a random candidate persona attribute \u03c0\u2032\u2208\u03a0e. We use the NLI model to assess whether \u03c0\u2032 contradicts any persona attribute in the profile. This is determined by the condition: \u2200\u03c0\u2208U:(\u03c0\u2032\u2192\u0338\u00ac\u2062\u03c0)\u2227(\u03c0\u2192\u0338\u00ac\u2062\u03c0\u2032), where \u2192 is an inference. Additionally, we evaluate the similarity of \u03c0\u2032 to the persona attributes in U to prevent the addition of redundant attributes. We add \u03c0\u2032 to U if it meets the consistency and non-redundancy criteria. We repeat this process until the user profile contains 5 persona attributes. Please refer to Appendix A.1 for more details on the user profile construction.\n3.2 User Pairing\n\nIn this component, we identify potential pairs of users for conversations. As the conversations are persona-based, we hypothesize that they will be more engaging if the users\u2019 personas exhibit more commonalities. We assign a similarity score to every pair of user profiles (U1,U2), indicating their semantic similarity. We leverage BERT to represent the user profiles. The similarity between U1 and U2 is defined as: |{(\u03c01,\u03c02)|\u03c01\u2208U1,\u03c02\u2208U2,\u2203c:\u03c01,\u03c02\u2208c}| Where c is a persona attributes cluster. The semantic similarity is quantified by the number of common persona categories in the user profiles. We pair U1 and U2 if their similarity exceeds a threshold of 2.\n3.3 Conversation Generation\n\nOur Conversation Generation component is similar to a general-purpose dataset generation framework that generates data samples, and refines them based on a set of predefined criteria, which we refer to as policies Madaan et al. (2023). The flexibility in the choice of policies for data generation allows us to emphasize different objectives. Once the active policies are selected, this component generates new data samples using a few input samples. The input to our Conversation Generation framework consists of a set of paired user profiles, a few samples of user profiles along with a persona-based conversation between them, and conversation quality metrics as policies. We follow a Generator-Critic architecture, and iteratively create the dataset following the steps shown in Figure 5:\nStep 1 The Generator outputs candidate conversations between persona pairs using a few initial conversation samples.\nStep 2 The Critic evaluates the candidate conversations based on the predetermined policies, and selects the best candidate conversations.\nStep 3 The best candidate conversations are added to the dataset for the next iteration of generation.\nThis iterative process of selecting the top candidates and adding them to the dataset gradually improves the performance of the Generator.\n\nWithout any loss of generality, we implement both the Generator and the Critic based on LLMs. Specifically, the Generator prompts an LLM to create candidate conversations, while the Critic prompts an LLM to evaluate the quality of the generated conversations.\n\nWe provide more details on the Generator, Critic, and the policies we used.\nRefer to caption\nFigure 5: The Generator-Critic Architecture for Conversation Generation\n\nThe Generator outputs conversations for pairs of users (U1,U2) by prompting an LLM Brown et al. (2020b); Wei et al. (2023). At each iteration, it randomly selects 5 samples from an initial set of conversations, each containing a pair of user profiles and a dialogue among them. It feeds these samples to a template that instructs the LLM to generate a series of candidate conversations for the given user pair. The template, and a sample generated conversation are available in Table 6, and Table 8 in the appendix.\n\nThe Critic selects the best generated conversations to fine-tune the Generator. A conversation is deemed high-quality if it complies with the policies of the Critic. Given the multifaceted nature of the conversation evaluations, we use a Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach. Each expert evaluates the conversation based on a specific policy. In this paper, we incorporate three types of experts, each with distinct criteria: general conversation quality, persona faithfulness, and toxicity. Collectively, these experts select the best generated conversations (the single best in our experiments). We describe each type of expert, and the collective decision-making process below.\n\nGeneral Conversation Quality experts assess conversation quality using the Fine-grained Evaluation of Dialog (FED) metrics introduced in Mehri and Esk\u00e9nazi (2020). These experts use verbalized forms of the policies from FED as prompts. For instance, the \"conversation depth quality expert\" transforms the \"depth policy\" from FED into a prompt like \"Which conversation is a deeper conversation between user 1 and user 2?\". Our system instructs the LLM to compare each pair of candidate conversations based on these policies, resulting in pairwise comparisons. The list of policies and their baseline performance are presented in Table 5 in Appendix A.2.\n\nThe Faithfulness expert ensures the consistency of the generated conversations with the user profiles. It uses an LLM to identify instances of unfaithful conversations. The faithfulness prompt provides the LLM with explicit instructions, user profiles, and human-curated examples of unfaithful conversations.\n\nThe Toxicity expert detects any conversation that exhibits harmful traits, including bias and hate.\n\nThe Critic filters unfaithful and toxic conversations out. It then selects the best conversations using a majority vote among the General Conversation Quality experts. The selected instances are added to the dataset for the next iteration of the Generator.\n4 Evaluation\n\nWe evaluate different aspects of our dataset generation framework, and the resulting dataset - referred to as Synthetic-Persona-Chat - which is created using an instruction fine-tuned LLM with 24 billion parameters Chung et al. (2022). We compare Synthetic-Persona-Chat (SPC) against the widely used Persona-Chat (PC) dataset across different dimensions. We begin by evaluating the quality of the personas we generate. We then evaluate SPC using both automatic metrics, and human assessment. We analyze other aspects of SPC, such as toxicity and diversity in appendices B.1 and B.1.\n4.1 Evaluation of the Expanded Personas\n\nWe evaluate our persona expansion module on two seed datasets: Wikipedia, and Persona-Chat. The Wikipedia personas are created by crawling the 1,000 most active contributors2\n2\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_Wikipedians_by_number_of_edits, and extracting user boxes from their pages. We expand both datasets using our framework, and evaluate the expanded persona attribute sets using automatic metrics. Table 1 compares the original persona sets to the expanded ones on a few dimensions. We observe that our persona expansion increases the number of persona attributes in SPC by 119%, while maintaining the original persona categories and expanding them by 71% compared to the persona attributes in PC. Moreover, the lengths of the new generated persona attributes are 107% longer in SPC, indicating that the new personas exhibit greater detail and specificity. We observe a similar trend when applying our persona expansion to the Wikipedia persona set, with a 108% increase in the number of persona attributes, a 140% increase in persona categories, and a 45% growth in persona attribute lengths. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in expanding and diversifying persona sets.\nDataset \tPersona-Chat \tSynthetic-Persona-Chat \tWikipedia \tWikipedia+\n# Persona Attributes \t4,723 \t10,371 \t8768 \t18,293\n# Clusters \t323 \t553 \t408 \t986\nInter-cluster Dist \t0.836 \t0.863 \t0.816 \t0.85\nAVG length \t7.65 \t15.9* \t10.45 \t15.2*\nTable 1: Evaluation of the expanded persona sets. The numbers with * indicate the metric value of the newly generated persona attributes to contrast with the initial set.\n4.2 Next Utterance Prediction\n\nA persona-based conversation reflects the speaker\u2019s persona explicitly or implicitly. Therefore, we expect the inclusion of information about speaker personas to enhance the performance of next utterance prediction models in such conversations. In this experiment, we assess the impact of incorporating speaker personas as prior information on both ranking, and generative - Transformer based Vaswani et al. (2017) - next utterance prediction models. We create a subset of SPC containing conversations among user pairs included in PC for a fair comparison.\n\t\tPersona-Chat \tSynthetic-Persona-Chat\nMethod \tMetric \tNone \tPersona \t% Change \tNone \tPersona \t% Change\nIR Baseline \thit@1 \t18.69 \t36.86 \t+97 \t19.37 (19.92) \t39.6 (26.23) \t+104 (+31)\nTransformer (Ranker) \thit@1 \t14.24 \t19.21 \t+35 \t9.71 (64.24) \t11.74 (68.82) \t+21 (+7)\nTransformer (Generator) \thit@1 \t8.54 \t6.78 \t-20 \t6.89 (41.32) \t6.66 (37.35) \t-3 (-9)\nPerplexity \t122.5 \t173.3 \t+41 \t1032 (5.24) \t1126 (5.73) \t+9 (+9)\nBLUE \t0.120 \t0.094 \t-21 \t0.097 (0.289) \t0.083 (0.251) \t-14 (-13)\nROUGE \t0.141 \t0.113 \t-24 \t0.123 (0.348) \t0.107 (0.309) \t-13 (-11)\nTable 2: Results of the next utterance prediction experiment. Performance of the trained model on the test split of Persona-Chat is represented by the numbers in the table, while the numbers in parentheses indicate results for the test split of Synthetic-Persona-Chat.\n\nWe observe (Table 2) that the performance of ranking models increases when personas are given to the models as input for both datasets. Specifically, the Transformer (Ranker) model, known for its ability to capture conversational complexity, exhibits higher performance in SPC when evaluated on the SPC test set compared to the PC test set. However, it demonstrates relatively weaker performance when trained on the PC. This implies that SPC contains more intricate and coherent conversations.\n\nThe Transformer (Ranker) trained on SPC achieves a hit@1 of 64.24 on SPC test, 350% higher than PC (14.24). This suggests that the Transformer model can more accurately predict the next utterance in SPC, pointing to a greater coherency in conversations.\n\nThe performance of the Information Retrieval (IR) Baseline model is slightly higher for SPC: it rises by 31% when conditioned on user personas, which is lower than 97% improvement in PC. A key contributing factor for the performance improvement of the retrieval-based model (IR Baseline) on PC given the personas, is the participants\u2019 tendency to copy persona words in the conversations, whereas in SPC the personas are more implicitly reflected in the conversations. The implicit reflection of personas in SPC, makes the task more challenging for word based retrieval models, necessitating reasoning that goes beyond word level. However, when the model is trained on SPC and tested on PC, the improvement is as high as when the model is trained on PC, i.e. 104% compared to 97%.\n\nThe performance of generative models is low for this task since these models are not trained with the ranking objective. However, the performance difference while the models are conditioned on personas is lower for the model trained on SPC, with a 20% drop for the model trained on PC against 3% drop in the model trained on SPC. The increase in perplexity is 9% in SPC compared to 41% in PC. The lower rate of perplexity increase and performance drop of the model given user personas as input highlights the higher alignment of conversations with personas in SPC.\n\nWe also evaluate the performance of the next utterance prediction models when given no user, one user, and both user personas. The results suggest a higher degree of bidirectionality in SPC. We refer the reader to the Appendix B.1 for more details.\n4.3 Human Evaluation\n\nWe compare the quality of the conversations generated by our framework against those in Persona-Chat. We randomly select 200 conversations from PC, together with their corresponding user pairs, and use our method to generate conversations among the same users. We start by following Gehrmann et al. (2019) in running a human experiment to try and detect AI-generated content. We conduct a Turing test where we present pairs of conversations to humans, and ask them to identify the synthetically generated one. This test is carried out on the generated conversations at the end of each iteration of creating SPC. We repeat the test for conversations generated for new persona pairs, which we refer to as iteration 3*, i.e. we pair each of these conversations with a random conversation from PC. For a robust evaluation, every pair of conversations is annotated by 3 human evaluators, and the majority vote is used as the final annotation. Details of this test are available in Appendix B.2. The results of this experiment can be found in Table 3. We observe that the losing rate of SPC is reduced by 48% from SPC Iter 1 to SPC Iter 3, and dropped below the rate of 10%. Interestingly, 91% of the conversations in SPC, which are synthetically generated, are judged as human-like as the conversations generated by humans. Moreover, conversations generated for new personas (Iteration 3*) are deemed artificial in only 8.04% of cases, showing that SPC is more realistic than PC.\n\nWe also evaluate the faithfulness of the generated conversations. For each conversation, we provide annotators with a faithfulness annotation task including the speakers\u2019 persona attributes and distractor persona attribute options as shown in Figure 8. We evaluate faithfulness during 3 iterations of conversation generation for the selected 200 user pairs, and the annotators evaluate the generated conversations for each pair in every iteration. The results show that, while improving the Turing test results, faithfulness of conversations are consistently higher than 75% with at most 3% variation in between iterations, indicating high faithfulness in all iterations.\n\nFinally, we assess the impact of LLM size on the quality of the generated dataset within our framework. We create a variant of SPC using an LLM with 540 billion parameters (LLM2). Table 3 presents human evaluations comparing the smaller LLM in multiple iterations to a single-iteration approach with LLM2. The larger model exhibits a 5% advantage in the Turing test over the first iteration of dataset generation over the smaller model. After two iterations, however, the multi-iteration approach outperforms the first iteration of the bigger model, showing our framework\u2019s capacity for cost-effective, high-quality conversation generation.\nConversation Source \tLose \tWin \tTie \tFaithful\nSPC Iter 1 \t17.2 \t30.1 \t52.68 \t78.5\nSPC Iter 2 \t18.5 \t49 \t32.5 \t80.5\nSPC Iter 3 \t8.8 \t35.23 \t55.95 \t76.6\nSPC Iter 3* \t8.04 \t32.66 \t59.29 \tN/A\nSPC (LLM2) \t11.5 \t39 \t49.5 \tN/A\nTable 3: Turing Test on 200 Generated Conversations per Iteration: Synthetic-Persona-Chat Outcomes Against Persona-Chat.\n5 Related Work\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have been used for data augmentation Shin et al. (2021), generation Kim et al. (2023); Dong et al. (2023), and evaluation Zhang et al. (2019); Liu et al. (2023). One of the earliest works in this area Anaby-Tavor et al. (2019) used LLMs to create a large text dataset from a small, labeled one. This idea was followed by Wang et al. (2021); Schick and Sch\u00fctze (2021) which leveraged LLMs to create datasets without any human data. Kumar et al. (2020) evaluated the performance of different LLMs on the data augmentation task. Several conversational dataset generation methods focused on the structure of the conversational data Dai et al. (2022); Leszczynski et al. (2023); Abbasiantaeb et al. (2023). Mehri et al. (2022) illustrated how Large Language Models (LLMs) can effectively generate synthetic training data for task-oriented dialogue models.\n\nPersona-based conversations have been a popular research topic in NLP Liu et al. (2022). One of the earliest works in this area is Persona-Chat, by Zhang et al. (2018), which proposed the Persona-Chat dataset and evaluation metrics that have become a benchmark for persona-based conversation generation Mazar\u00e9 et al. (2018). Many subsequent works have used this dataset to train and evaluate their models, including DialoGPT Zhang et al. (2020), BlenderBot Shuster et al. (2022), and PersonaChatGen Lee et al. (2022). PersonaChatGen automated the process of creating persona based conversations of Persona-Chat using LLMs. A challenge in generating synthetic datasets is to ensure the quality of the conversation including data faithfulness, fidelity, diversity, and consistency Li et al. (2016); Lee et al. (2023); Veselovsky et al. (2023); Zhuo et al. (2023); Wang et al. (2023a); M\u00fcndler et al. (2023). Several works have focused on creating and using high quality training datasets Welleck et al. (2019), and creating quality filtering components to their conversation dataset generation Lewkowycz et al. (2022). Evaluation of the resulting conversational datasets is also challenging Xu et al. (2021). Wang et al. (2023b) recently introduced the paradigm of interactive evaluation of conversations with LLMs.\n6 Conclusion and Future Work\n\nWe developed a novel framework for generating high-quality persona-based conversations using LLMs, resulting in the creation of Synthetic-Persona-Chat, comprising 20k conversations. We hope this dataset will support future endeavors in developing persona-aware conversational agents, including the generation of domain-specific multi-session conversations for specialized, task-oriented interactions. While we focused on a persona-based dataset generation task, our Generator-Critic approach can be generalized to other use cases, such as generating other specialized datasets, etc.\nLimitations\n\nIn this paper, we define an iterative process over LLMs to generate a dataset. Our method requires computational resources, and access to an LLM. The quality of the dataset is bounded by the LLM, since the quality critics are also using the same LLM, and we leave the iterative improvement of our critics as future work. The main limitation of this data generation framework is the inability to generate realistic conversations that do not have high quality, since we assume that both parties are fluent, that the conversation flow is perfectly consistent, and there is no unexpected event (e.g. an interruption by another person, connection loss, etc.) in the middle of the conversation. Another limitation of our method is the difficulty of incorporating less tangible persona traits, such as a sense of humor, or user attributes that require multiple conversation sessions to be reflected.\nEthics Statement\n\nThe approach of generating datasets based on some desired objective might be used to create harmful datasets, and train malicious models based on them, such as a biased dataset, or a hateful speech one Hartvigsen et al. (2022). On the other hand, these datasets and models can be used as filters in application tasks.\n\nWe used Amazon Mechanical Turk in our human experiments, and followed that platform\u2019s guidelines to protect the rights of human raters. The participation was voluntary, and the raters were informed of their rights at the beginning of the study. The platform implemented security measures to protect them, and prevent the disclosure of any Personal Identifiable Information about them. Furthermore, we offered higher than minimum standard wage compensation to avoid any exploitative practices.\n\nTo avoid having any toxic conversation in the final dataset, we also used several tools to remove any potentially toxic conversation. Details about these tools, and example removed samples are available in Appendix B.1.\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors would like to thank Kian Ahrabian, Eric Boxer, Luke Friedman, I\u00f1aki Iturrate, Kathy Meir-Hellstern, Filip Radlinski, and Kexuan Sun for their valuable comments on this manuscript.\nReferences\n\n    Abbasiantaeb et al.

We created Synthetic-Persona-Chat using an LLM with 24 billion parameters. We use top-k sampling with k=40 for decoding during generation, and set the temperature value to 0.7 in all components. We give more details on user and conversation generation components in the following subsections.\nA.1 User Generation\n\nIn our framework, the user generation component consists of two steps: expanding the persona attribute set, and creating realistic user profiles. In this section we provide details on our framework for these two steps:\nPersona Expansion\n\nAs described in Section 3.1.1, the persona expansion step involves identifying persona categories in the initial persona attribute set \u03a00, generating queries associated with those categories, and bootstrapping queries to create a query set Q. In our framework, we employ the Scikit-learn Pedregosa et al. (2011) implementation of an agglomerative clustering to identify persona categories following this clustering method: we represent each persona using a BERT-based representation. Our clustering approach is bottom-up, starting with each persona attribute as an individual cluster. At each step, we combine two clusters if their similarity exceeds a predetermined threshold of 0.1. The similarity of two clusters is measured using inter-cluster average cosine similarity. The process continues until no pair of clusters is more similar than the threshold.\n\nAfter identifying the clusters, we sample 3 instances of persona attributes for each cluster, and prompt the LLM using the template in shown in section 3 to construct an initial query set Q0. We expand the query set Q0 using bootstrapping. At each step, we sample 5 instances from the available queries, and prompt the LLM using the template in Table 6. We repeat this process for 100 steps. Examples of initial persona attributes, induced queries, bootstrapped queries, and bootstrapped persona attributes can be found in Table 4. The prompt templates used in this component are available in Table 6.\nUser Profile Generation\n\nWe illustrate a sample user profile creation process in Figure 6. As shown in the figure, at each iteration, a randomly selected persona attribute is checked for consistency and non-redundancy.\n\nLet \u03c0\u2032 be a randomly selected persona attribute in an iteration. For the redundancy criteria, we use the BERT representation of persona attributes. We compute the similarity of the new candidate persona attribute \u03c0\u2032 with every persona attribute in the user profile. If it is more than a threshold (0.9 in these experiments) similar to an attribute in the user profile, \u03c0\u2032 is deemed as redundant and will not be added to the user profile. We use the cosine similarities of the BERT representations of the persona attributes.\n\nFor the consistency criteria, we use the NLI model to verify the consistency of this persona attribute with the user profile. For every persona attribute in the current user profile \u03c0, we prompt the LLM to create the negated persona attribute \u00ac\u2062\u03c0. Then, we query the NLI model to check whether \u00ac\u2062\u03c0 is inferred by \u03c0\u2032 or \u00ac\u2062\u03c0\u2032 is inferred by \u03c0. If either of these cases is inferred, then the selected persona attribute is not consistent with the user profile, and not added to the profile.\n\nDataset\n\t\n\nPersona Source\n\t\n\nQuery\n\t\n\nExample Persona Attribute\n\nPersona-Chat\n\tHuman \t\n\nWhat is your job?\n\t\n\nI am a pharmacist.\n\nWhere do you live?\n\t\n\nI live close to the coast.\n\nDo you have any pets?\n\t\n\nI have a doberman.\nLLM \t\n\nWhat are your talents?\n\t\n\nI am a great listener.\n\nWhat is your hair color?\n\t\n\nMy hair is auburn.\n\nWhat is your favorite song?\n\t\n\nI like the song \"Leather and Lace\".\n\nWikipedia\n\tHuman \t\n\nWhat are your hobbies?\n\t\n\nI spend WAY too much time on Wikipedia.\n\nWhat is your view on the metric system?\n\t\n\nI find the metric system to be a logical and efficient way to measure things.\nLLM \t\n\nWhat is the name of the first album you ever purchased?\n\t\n\nMy first album was The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\n\nWhat are you interested in?\n\t\n\nI\u2019m looking to learn new recipes and improve my cooking skills.\nTable 4: Persona Categories and Induced Queries Using Our Framework. Queries are generated by the Large Language Model (LLM). Queries for personas with the \"LLM\" as source, are generated through bootstrapping, while those with \"human\" as source are generated by sampling persona categories and prompting the LLM. Personas with \"human\" as the source are authored by humans, while \"LLM\" rows represent personas generated using our framework.\nRefer to caption\nFigure 6: User Profile Construction Example\nA.2 Conversation Generation\nLLM-based Critic\n\nIn our framework, the critic is implemented by prompting an LLM. We included a mixture of experts approach in the critic, where each expert prompts the LLM to assess a specific policy in the candidate conversations. Our framework includes a set of experts to control the general conversation quality. We evaluate the performance of these experts using a baseline dataset. The baseline dataset for this experiment is FED which consists of 125 human-annotated instances evaluated at the conversation level. We pair the conversations and evaluate the experts based on the number of correctly ranked pairs. As shown in Table 5, we observe that these experts are more than 80% accurate in distinguishing the better conversation within the pairs. The template for the verbalized form of these experts used in our framework can be found in Table 6.\nPolicy \tPerformance\nDepth \t0.84\nCoherency \t0.96\nConsistency \t0.92\nDiversity \t0.92\nLikable \t0.88\nTable 5: List of FED Experts for Persona-Based Conversation Generation Critic.

Variables enclosed in {} are filled when the template is populated.\n\nWe also included a toxicity expert and a persona faithfulness expert in the critic. The prompt templates used in these experts are available in Table 6. The persona faithfulness leverages in-context- learning capability of LLMs. It includes a few human-curated examples of faithful and unfaithful conversations in the instruction prompt. Refer to Table 7 for examples of faithful and unfaithful conversations used in the instruction prompt.\n\nUser Profiles\n\t\n\nConversations\n\t\n\nFaithfulness Explanation\n\nUser 1:\nOne of my favorite hobbies is gaming.\nI currently work in an office.\nI enjoy running\n\nUser 2:\nI am applying for publishing jobs.\nMy mother is a librarian.\nThe only autographs I\u2019ve ever wanted are from authors.\nI used to wear glasses as a child.\nMy favorite color is green.\n\t\n\nUser 1: Do you like video games?\n\nUser 2: No, I do not like video games.\n\nUser 1: What do you do for a living?\n\nUser 2: I am a librarian.\n\nUser 1: I guess that is why you like to read a lot.\n\nUser 2: Yes, I like to read books.\n\nUser 1: What is your favorite color?

What do you like to do in your free time?\n\nUser 2: I love to go hiking and play jazz piano.\n\nUser 1: Wow, that sounds really nice. I like to watch game of thrones and play soccer.\n\nUser 2: I have never seen game of thrones, but I love soccer.\n\nUser 1: You should watch it, it is really good.\n\nUser 2: I will check it out.\n\t\n\nYes, the conversation contradicts user 2\u2019s profile. In the profile, user 2 says they love game of thrones, but in the conversation user 2 says they have never seen it.\n\nUser 1:\nMy favorite book is David Copperfield.\nI have a twin brother.\nI am really short.\nI love to bake cakes.\nI have won tap dance competitions.\n\nUser 2:\nI enjoy spending a lot of money on my hobbies.\nI love photography.\nI like to use candles instead of lights.\nI do not like waking up early.\n\t\n\nUser 1: Hi there!

I do not like waking up early.\n\nUser 1: Do you like to spend money?\n\nUser 2: I love spending money on my hobbies.\n\t\n\nNo, the conversation does not contradict either user profiles. Although user 2 says they are really short, which is in user 1\u2019s profile, it doesn\u2019t mean user 2 cannot be really short too.\nTable 7: Examples of Faithful and Unfaithful Conversations for Prompting the Persona Faithfulness Expert in Our Framework. The \u2018Faithfulness explanation\u2019 columns are used to fill the \u2018explanation\u2019 variable in the faithfulness expert template.\nAppendix B Synthetic-Persona-Chat\n\nSynthetic-Persona-Chat is made of 20k conversations, with an average of 11.8 turns per user for each. An example Synthetic-Persona-Chat conversation can be found in Table 8. We compare Synthetic-Persona-Chat to Persona-Chat across different dimensions. We first assess the characteristics of SPC using various automatic evaluators, i.e. evaluators which do not require human effort. We then conduct a human evaluation experiment on a subset of SPC.\n\nUser Profiles\n\t\n\nConversation\n\nUser 1\n\nI am male.\n\nMy weakness are sweets.\n\nI am unsociable.\n\nI am a jack of all, master of none.\n\nUser 2\n\nMy favorite music is rock and roll.\n\nI love to travel.\n\nI am from Russia.\n\nI enjoy skiing.\n\nI go to school for business.\n\t\n\nUser 1: Hello\n\nUser 2: Hello, what\u2019s your name?\n\nUser 1: My name is [name], and you?\n\nUser 2: My name is [name], I\u2019m from Russia.\n\nUser 1: Nice to meet you, [name].

This conversation was synthesized from user profiles in Persona-Chat\nB.1 Automatic Evaluation\n\nWe conduct a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of SPC across different dimensions and compare it against PC. We start by analyzing the toxicity and diversity of SPC using off the shelf tools. Then, we elaborate on the experiments which assess the efficacy of SPC used as the dataset for the next utterance prediction and the profile extraction tasks. Finally, we evaluate the quality of SPC conversations using LLM-based evaluation methods.\nToxicity Analysis\n\nWe analyze the toxicity of the generated conversations at the final iteration of SPC using an online tool called Perspective3\n3\nhttps://perspectiveapi.com/. We reproduce the results of a detailed analysis of toxicity in PC as well as in each iteration of our data generation framework while producing SPC in Table 9.\n\t\tToxicity \t\t\tProfanity \t\nConfidence \tweak(< .2) \tmedium(.2-.8) \tstrong(>.8) \tweak(< .2) \tmedium(.2-.8) \tstrong(>.8)\nPC \t10875 \t4448 \t53 \t10891 \t1676 \t57\nSPC Iter 1 \t10902 \t1192 \t3 \t10903 \t340 \t3\nSPC Iter 2 \t10900 \t1096 \t1 \t10901 \t345 \t1\nSPC Iter 3 \t10902 \t1088 \t1 \t10902 \t376 \t0\nTable 9: Frequency of Toxic Conversations in Persona-Chat and Synthetic-Persona-Chat\n\nWe observe a notable reduction in the frequency of conversations deemed as strongly toxic or profane throughout the iterations of generating SPC. This reduction can be attributed to the built-in toxicity filter of the employed LLM. While PC contains more than 50 samples that are identified as strongly toxic, SPC includes at most three toxic or profane conversations, which is significantly lower (at least 15 times less). Interestingly, the fraction of conversations with medium profanity and toxicity in SPC is 4 times less than the same type of conversations in PC across all iterations. We have removed any conversation that was marked as strongly toxic by this tool in the released dataset. Samples of toxic conversations are provided in Table 10.\n\nSource\n\t\n\nConversation\n\nPersona-Chat\n\t\n\n\u2026\nUser 1: I like bloody stuff.\nUser 2: It reminds me of the dark which makes me afraid of it.\nUser 1: You are a silly goose.\n\nPersona-Chat\n\t\n\n\u2026\nUser 2: Cool. Why do you say that? Because I am a red head?\nUser 1: No. Ikn. Why do you ask so many questions? Mr. Thomas is dumb.\n\nSynthetic-Persona-Chat\n\t\n\nUser 1: I can imagine.

The first two examples are segments of conversations from Persona-Chat. The final example is a segment from a toxic conversation in Synthetic-Persona-Chat, which has been removed in the released dataset.\nDiversity Analysis\n\nWe use hierarchical topic modeling Blei et al. (2004) to assess the topic diversity of SPC and compare it to that of PC. For a fair comparison, we only compare conversations in SPC with similar personas in PC. Table 11 displays the number of topics at each level of the topic tree, with the first level indicating the most general topic. We observe similar topic diversity at the first level. In deeper levels, there is a slightly lower diversity in SPC.\nTopic Level \tPC \tSPC\n1 \t27 \t27\n2 \t232 \t213\n3 \t470 \t403\n4 \t137 \t118\n5 \t30 \t26\nTable 11: Vertical Topic Diversity in Persona-based Datasets\nNext Utterance Prediction\n\nWe compare the performance of different models on the next utterance prediction task. As discussed in Section 4.2, these models are expected to exhibit better performance in the next utterance prediction task when user personas are provided as prior information. We evaluate ranking and generative models for response selection to assess this property. We compare models trained on SPC to the same models trained on PC. We use the implementations provided in Miller et al. (2017) for the following models:\n\n    \u2022\n\n    IR Baseline Given an utterance as a query, the IR baseline finds the most similar utterance in the training corpus using tf-idf. It defines the utterance after the most similar utterance as the candidate response, and then returns the most similar option to that candidate as the output.\n    \u2022\n\n    Transformer-Ranker The context of the conversation, as well as the candidate next utterances, are encoded using a BERT-based encoder. The most similar encoded candidate to the conversation context, as measured by a dot-product in their representation space, is selected as the output Humeau et al. (2020).\n    \u2022\n\n    Transformer-Generator This model is a sequence-to-sequence model Sutskever et al. (2014) which uses transformers as encoders and decoders.\n    \t\tPersona-Chat \tSynthetic-Persona-Chat\n    Method \tMetric \tNo Persona \tSelf Persona \tTheir Persona \tBoth Personas \tNo Persona \tSelf Persona \tTheir Persona \tBoth Personas\n    IR baseline \thit@1 \t0.1869 \t0.3683 \t0.1519 \t0.3281 \t0.1861 \t0.2596 \t0.1882 \t0.2493\n    Transformer(Ranker) \thit@1 \t0.2513 \t0.275 \t0.1922 \t0.2572 \t0.7164 \t0.6227 \t0.6988 \t0.7214\n    Transformer \thit@1 \t0.0896 \t0.08512 \t0.0873 \t0.0813 \t0.0526 \t0.629 \t0.053 \t0.051\n    (Generator) \tppl \t65.57 \t72.24 \t62.49 \t64.07 \t5.54 \t5.47 \t5.4 \t5.405\n    Table 12: Evaluation of Next Utterance Prediction models conditioned on different user personas.\n\nWe also evaluate the performance of the next utterance prediction models when given no user, one user, and both user personas. The results of this experiment are available in Table 12. We observe that the highest performance improvement for all models trained on PC is when self-personas are given as input. We do not observe such a pattern in SPC. This indicates a higher degree of bidirectionality in SPC conversations compared to those of PC.\nProfile Extraction\n\nA potential use-case of the SPC dataset is training a model to predict user personas from a conversation. This is only possible if the dataset is highly faithful, meaning that any persona attribute inferred from the conversation is in the user profile or compatible with the user profile. In this context, a faithful conversation is expected to have high precision in the profile extraction task, while a conversation that highly reflects user personas is expected to have high recall in this task.\n\nWe evaluate the task of user profile extraction for conversations in SPC, and compare the results against those of PC. We frame the task of profile extraction as a ranking task, using the utterances within the conversations as queries. The goal is to rank a set of persona attribute options. For each conversation, we include the speakers\u2019 persona attributes in the available options. Additionally, we select 25 random user persona attributes from other speaker profiles within the dataset to serve as distractors. The input to the profile extraction is utterances from a single user as the speaker, while the output is a list of persona attribute options for a target user, which could be either user 1 or user 2. The results of this experiment are presented in Table 13. We observe that the performance of the profile extraction methods is higher in SPC in 3 of the 4 scenarios. Interestingly, we observe that with both datasets, when the target and the speaker are different, the performance of profile extraction is greater compared to the cases when the target and speaker users are the same.\n\t\tF-Score\nTarget \tSpeaker \tPC \tSPC\nuser 1 \tuser 1 \t0.505 \t0.574\nuser 1 \tuser 2 \t0.737 \t0.68\nuser 2 \tuser 1 \t0.50 \t0.57\nuser 2 \tuser 2 \t0.456 \t0.494\nTable 13: Accuracy of Profile Extraction in Four Different Scenarios. The \u2018Target\u2019 column represents the user profile to be extracted, while the \u2018Speaker\u2019 column indicates the speaker of the turns given to the model as input.\nLLM-based Quality Evaluation\n\nWe leverage LLM-based conversation quality evaluators from the literature to compare the quality of SPC and PC. These evaluators rely on the human curated prompt templates for different metrics including consistency, fluency, etc. We used these evaluators with minimum change in the original prompt templates. These evaluators are:\n\n    \u2022\n\n    LLM-Eval Lin and Chen (2023) is a multi-dimensional automatic evaluation designed for conversations. It uses a human-curated prompt which describes evaluation dimensions, serving as a unified evaluation schema. This prompt evaluates the conversation across multiple dimensions (e.g. fluency) in a single model call. We show this unified schema in Table 14.\n    \u2022\n\n    GPT-Score Fu et al. (2023) leverages emergent abilities of LLMs, i.e. zero-shot instructions, to score texts. It contains a prompt template, and for each quality criterion, populates the template with a human description of the criteria along with the valid score range for that criteria. Example prompts are provided in Table 14.\n    \u2022\n\n    G-Eval Liu et al. (2023) introduces a framework that employs LLMs with a chain-of-thought approach to assess the quality of natural language generated outputs. For any evaluation criteria, G-Eval prompts the LLM with the criterion\u2019s description, prompting the model to generate the necessary evaluation steps. It then uses these steps to prompt the LLM to score given output for that criterion. It considers the probability of getting each permissible score as the output of the prompt, i.e., it considers the probability distribution of scores assigned by the LLM. The reported output is the expected value of the score distribution by the LLM. Table 14 includes an example prompt.\n\nEvaluator\n\t\n\nMetric\n\t\n\nPrompt Template\n\nLLM-Eval\n\t\n\nAll\n\t\n\nHuman: The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.\n\nAs an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}} the object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.\n\nHere is the output schema: {\"properties\": {\"content\": {\"title\": \"Content\", \"description\": \"content score in the range of 0 to 100\", \"type\": \"integer\"}, \"grammar\": {\"title\": \"Grammar\", \"description\": \"grammar score in the range of 0 to 100\", \"type\": \"integer\"}, \"relevance\": {\"title\": \"Relevance\", \"description\": \"relevance score in the range of 0 to 100\", \"type\": \"integer\"}, \"appropriateness\": {\"title\": \"Appropriateness\", \"description\": \"appropriateness score in the range of 0 to 100\", \"type\": \"integer\"}}, \"required\": [\"content\", \"grammar\", \"relevance\", \"appropriateness\"]}\n\nScore the following dialogue generated on a continuous scale from {score-min} to {score-max}.\nDialogue: {dialogue}\n\nGPT-Score\n\t\n\nConsistency\n\t\n\nAnswer the question based on the conversation between two users.\n\nQuestion: Are the responses of users consistent in the information they provide throughout the conversation?

You will then be given one conversation between this persona pair.\n\nYour task is to rate the conversation on one metric.\n\nPlease make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.\n\nEvaluation Criteria:\n\nCoherence (1-5) - the collective quality of all utterances. We align this dimension with the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) quality question of structure and coherence (https://duc.nist.gov/duc2007/quality-questions.txt), whereby \"the conversation should be well-structured and well-organized. The conversation should not just be a heap of related information, but should build from utterance to a coherent body of conversation about a topic.\"\n\nEvaluation Steps:\n\n1. Read and understand the given conversation between the pair of user personas.\n2. Evaluate the conversation based on the coherence of the utterances.\n3. Rate the conversation on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest coherence and 1 being the lowest coherence.\n4. Justify the rating by referring to specific aspects of the conversation that demonstrate its coherence or lack thereof.\n\nExample:\n\nPersonas: {personas}\n\nConversation: {dialogue}\n\nEvaluation Form (scores ONLY):\n\n- Coherence:\nLLM-Faithfulness \t\n\nInference\n\t\n\nInstruction: Select User {user} persona attributes that are directly inferred from this conversation.\n\nContradiction\n\t\n\nInstruction: Select User {user} persona attributes that strongly contradict this conversation.\nTable 14: Prompt Templates in LLM-based Conversation Quality Evaluators. Variables enclosed in {} are filled when the template is populated.\n\nResults of this evaluation are presented in Table 15. We observe that SPC consistently outperforms PC across all the dimensions we evaluate. The superiority of SPC is more prominent when using GPT-Score, for which each evaluated criterion shows an average improvement of at least 23 points.\nEvaluator \tCriteria \tPC \tSPC \tSPC Iter 1 \tFED \tFaithfulness\nLLM-Eval Lin and Chen (2023) \tContent \t81.96 \t88.84 \t88.71 \t87.61 \t88.67\nGrammar \t87.12 \t93.64 \t93.68 \t93.09 \t93.56\nRelevance \t86.82 \t94.16 \t93.81 \t92.88 \t93.79\nAppropriateness \t86.99 \t95.84 \t96.17 \t95.68 \t96.19\nGPT-Score Fu et al.

We conduct a Turing test, and a faithfulness study - both of which we describe in more details in the following subsections - at the end of every iteration of the generation of SPC.\nTuring Test\n\nWe randomly select 200 user pairs from PC. For each example, we show the annotators the user pair, together with the corresponding conversations from PC and SPC, and ask them to select the conversation that was synthetically generated. We show an example of this crowdsourcing task in Figure 7. The results of the Turing test are available in Table 16. We report the losing rate of SPC in Turing test, and Fleiss\u2019 Kappa to assess the inter-rater agreement. The agreement falls into the fair to moderate agreement bucket.\nRefer to caption\nFigure 7: Preview of the Turing Test Task on the Crowdsourcing Platform\nConversation Source \t% Lose \t\u03ba \t# annotators\nSPC Iter 1 \t17.2 \t0.41 \t50\nSPC Iter 2 \t18.5 \t0.48 \t40\nSPC Iter 3 \t8.8 \t0.22 \t11\nSPC Iter 3* \t8.04 \t0.56 \t24\nSPC (LLM2) \t11.5 \t0.49 \t36\nTable 16: Turing test results on a sample of 200 conversations. The first column shows the percentage of SPC losing compared to PC in the Turing test. Note that the last iteration (3) of SPC is an evaluation of the segment of conversations based on the extended persona set.\nFaithfulness\n\nWe present the annotators with a conversation, and a set of options of persona attributes. The annotators are asked to select the user persona attributes they would infer from the conversation. Figure 8 shows a sample of the annotation task in this study. The options include the persona attributes of the speakers in the conversation, and a set of distractor persona attributes. We created distractor persona attributes using different strategies to cover different difficulty levels. For a persona attribute set \u03a0, we create a set \u00ac\u2062\u03a0 of distractor persona attributes as:\n\nNegated personas We prompt an LLM to negate persona attributes. For example, the negation of persona attribute \"I like vegetables\" is \"I don\u2019t like vegetables\".\n\nRandom personas We randomly select persona attributes from user profiles in other conversations in the dataset.\n\nContradicting personas We prompt an LLM to generate a persona attribute which contradicts the users\u2019 personas.\n\nEach entry of this task includes 8 user persona attributes as options, where 4 of them are the real persona attributes, and the other 4 are distractors. We evaluate the precision of the human annotators, and report it as a proxy to the conversation faithfulness in Table 3.\nRefer to caption\nFigure 8: Preview of the Faithfulness Task on the Crowdsourcing Platform.\nAppendix C Ablation Studies\n\nWe run several ablation studies to evaluate the importance of individual components in our framework. We begin by analyzing the effect of the persona expansion module. We then review the impact of each expert in the mixture forming our Critic.\nC.1 Persona Expansion\n\nWe assess the importance of the query-based persona expansion module introduced in Section 3.1.1. Similarly to the experiment outlined in Section 4.1, we run the persona expansion on two datasets: Wikipedia and PC. The results of this experiment are presented in Table 17. We designate the persona expansions without the inducted query set (Q) as \u2018Wikipedia-0\u2019, and \u2018PC-0\u2019, and run the same number of iterations for each (100 iterations). We observe that PC-0 includes 4,477 new persona attributes, 20 percent less than PC. The difference in the number of newly generated persona attributes is more pronounced in the case of Wikipedia, where Wikipedia-0 consists of 4,742 persona attributes, 50 percent less than Wikipedia+. This trend is also observed in the number of persona clusters, with PC-0 and Wikipedia-0 having 6% and 49% less clusters respectively. This pattern suggests the effectiveness of the query-based persona expansion in maintaining the diversity of the persona set. Furthermore, the average persona attribute length in PC-0 is 11.38 tokens, which is 28% less than SPC. This reduction points to less detailed and specific persona attributes. In contrast, the expansion in \u2018Wikipedia-0\u2019 exhibits similar average persona attribute lengths compared to \u2018Wikipedia+\u2019.\nDataset \tPC \tSPC \tPC-0 \tWikipedia \tWikipedia+ \tWikipedia-0\n# Persona Attributes \t4,723 \t10,371 \t9,200 \t8,768 \t18,293 \t13,510\n# Clusters \t323 \t553 \t520 \t408 \t986 \t502\nInterCluster-Dist \t0.836 \t0.863 \t0.842 \t0.816 \t0.85 \t0.83\nAVG length \t7.65 \t15.9* \t11.38* \t10.45 \t15.2* \t15.2*\nTable 17: Evaluation of the Expanded Persona Attribute Sets. The numbers with *\u2032\u2032 indicate the metric value on the newly generated persona attributes, in contrast to the initial persona attributes.\nC.2 Conversation Quality\n\nWe analyze the effect of the experts within our Critic. We remove each expert, and generate a dataset using one iteration of our framework. We compare the resulting datasets against the output of the first iteration of SPC. We use the evaluators introduced in B.1. The results of this experiment are summarized in Table 15. We observe that the exclusion of the experts results in worse performance according to most criteria: 3 out of 4 in LLM-Eval, 4 out of 6 in GPT-Score, and 3 out of 5 in G-Eval.\nC.3 Faithfulness\n\nWe ablate the faithfulness critic, and generate a dataset that we compare against SPC. We compare these datasets both automatically, using human annotators (Turing Test), and using a prompted LLM (LLM-Evaluator). We describe this study in more details below.\nTuring Test\n\nWe run a human study to compare a small subset of conversations created without the faithfulness expert against their equivalent created with that expert. This experiment process is similar to 4.3 and it is conducted for 200 conversations. The precision decreases from 78.0% to 66.0% without this critic, highlighting its effectiveness in eliminating conversations with contradictory information about user personas. The recall decreases from 36.0% to 23.0%, demonstrating a higher reflection of personas in the conversations in the presence of the faithfulness expert.\nLLM-Evaluator\n\nWe extend our comparison to the entire dataset using an LLM as an annotator, following He et al. (2023); Bansal and Sharma (2023); Chiang and yi Lee (2023). Table 18 shows the faithfulness of the conversations generated in the first iteration without the faithfulness expert. The templates used in the LLM-based annotators are described in Table 15 in the rows with \"LLM-Faithfulness\" as their evaluator. Note that the annotator-based LLM is created using a different LLM, gpt-3.5-turbo Brown et al. (2020a); Ouyang et al. (2022), than the LLM used for dataset generation.\n\tLLM Evaluator (%) \tHuman Evaluator (%)\nAbsent Component \tInference \tContradiction \tPrecision \tRecall\nNone \t33.2 \t24.5 \t78.5 \t36.4\nFaithfulness \t32.7 \t28.8 \t66.1 \t23.1\nFED \t31.7 \t28.5 \tN/A \tN/A\nTable 18: Faithfulness of Generated Conversation Datasets Using the Framework While Eliminating Each Component. The first row represents the framework without removing any component, equivalent to the first iteration of Synthetic-Persona-Chat.\nC.4 Next Utterance Prediction\n\nWe follow the experimental setting described in section 4.2, and compare the performance of various next utterance prediction models trained on SPC against the same models trained on datasets created in the absence of certain experts.\n\nWhen using the IR Baseline as the next utterance prediction method, we observee that its highest performance of 39% hit@1 occurs when the FED critic is absent during dataset creation. This outcome aligns with FED\u2019s emphasis on conversation quality, excluding persona-related aspects. Conversely, the Transformer Ranker, capable of understanding intricate concepts, achieves its peak performance of 13.9% hit@1 when none of the experts are absent. This result supports the inclusion of both FED and the Faithfulness expert in the model architecture.

These trusts were conglomerates controlling a large portion of certain industries, such as oil, steel, and railroads, effectively stifling competition, manipulating prices, and exploiting consumers and workers.\n\nThe term \"trust\" became synonymous with monopolistic practices. It specifically referred to the legal mechanism of consolidating power in these industries, where a trust was a legal arrangement in which shareholders in several companies transferred their shares to a single set of trustees. In exchange, these shareholders would receive a certificate entitling them to a specified share of the consolidated earnings of the trusts. This mechanism effectively allowed a small group of trustees to control multiple companies as if they were a single entity, leading to monopolies in various industries.\n\nIn response to the growing power of these trusts and their negative impacts on the economy and society, the U.S. government began to pass laws to regulate and break up these monopolies to ensure fair competition. The first significant piece of legislation in this area was the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, named after Senator John Sherman. The Act aimed to combat anticompetitive practices, reduce market domination by individual corporations, and preserve competition.\n\nThus, the term \"antitrust\" comes from the efforts to combat the power of these trusts\u2014hence \"anti-\" meaning against, and \"trust\" referring to the conglomerates that controlled much of the industry. The term remains in use, especially in the United States, to describe laws and actions designed to prevent monopolies and promote competition in the marketplace.

This game marked the debut of Sonic, aimed at competing with Nintendo\u2019s Mario. Given the timing, this leaves a narrow window from June to December 1991 for the game to have been introduced and circulated within the Soviet Union.\n\n### Technology and Media Consumption in the Soviet Union\n\nIn 1991, the Soviet Union was undergoing significant political and economic turmoil, which would eventually lead to its collapse in December. This period was marked by a level of openness not seen during the Cold War, but Western products and media were still not as widely available in the Soviet Union as they would become in the post-Soviet states.\n\nThe availability of video game consoles and games from the West would have been limited, largely restricted to major cities and accessible only to those with the means to afford such luxuries. Importantly, though, there was a thriving black market and a strong interest in Western pop culture among Soviet youth. Video games, as a component of that culture, were sought after, though they were more often than not pirated copies due to the high cost and low availability of genuine products.\n\n### Cultural Exchange Between the Soviet Union and the West\n\nBy 1991, the policies of Glasnost and Perestroika had significantly increased cultural exchanges and the permeability of the Iron Curtain. Western products, ideas, and pop culture were more accessible than ever before. However, this accessibility was still not uniform across the vast Soviet Union, and items like video game consoles would have been considered luxury goods.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven these factors, it is plausible, albeit challenging, for someone in the Soviet Union to have seen or even played Sonic the Hedgehog in 1991. This likelihood increases if we consider the more cosmopolitan areas like Moscow or Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg), where access to imported goods, including video games, was relatively higher. Individuals with connections to the West or those involved in the black market for Western goods would have had the best chance of encountering Sonic.\n\nHowever, the shrinking window of opportunity (June to December 1991), the logistical challenges of importing a game during a tumultuous economic period, and the relative scarcity and expense of gaming consoles suggest that very few Soviet citizens would have experienced Sonic the Hedgehog during the existence of the USSR. It's more likely that Sonic became familiar to most people in the post-Soviet space in the years following the Soviet Union's collapse, as Western culture and products flooded into the newly independent states."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user requested a detailed analysis on the difficulty of obtaining a Japanese Famicom console and games in the 1980s in the United States, and the likelihood of American awareness of the Famicom.

This analysis will explore these challenges in depth and also assess the likelihood of an American being aware of the Famicom during the 1980s.\n\n### Awareness of the Famicom in the United States\n\nThe Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was launched in the United States in 1985, a couple of years after the Famicom's debut in Japan in 1983. During the early and mid-1980s, the global exchange of information was not as instantaneous or widespread as it is today. The internet was not yet available to the general public, and video game journalism was in its infancy, primarily limited to a few magazines and newsletters. Hence, knowledge of foreign game systems like the Famicom would have been mostly confined to those deeply invested in video game culture or those with direct ties to Japan. The average American, especially in the early half of the decade, was unlikely to have been aware of the Famicom, much less understood it as the Japanese version of the NES.\n\n### Importing a Famicom and Games\n\n#### 1. **Lack of Internet and Online Marketplaces**\n\nNowadays, one can easily purchase international goods through online marketplaces like eBay or Amazon. However, in the 1980s, these platforms did not exist, making it much more difficult to find and procure a Famicom. Interested buyers would have to rely on niche import stores, mail-order catalogs, or personal contacts in Japan to obtain the console.\n\n#### 2. **Language Barrier**\n\nThe language barrier would be another significant obstacle. Most Americans in the 1980s had little to no knowledge of Japanese, making navigating Japanese mail-order catalogs, instructions, or game content challenging.\n\n#### 3. **Cost and Availability**\n\nImported goods often come at a premium, and the Famicom, being an electronic import in the 1980s, would have been no exception. Besides the base cost, shipping, import duties, and the retailer's markup could make the Famicom significantly more expensive than its American counterpart. Additionally, supply would likely have been limited, available only through niche outlets that specialized in Japanese imports, which were not commonplace.\n\n#### 4. **Technical Compatibility**\n\nEven if an American could obtain a Famicom, there would be technical challenges to overcome. The Famicom was designed for Japanese TV standards (NTSC-J), which differed slightly from U.S. standards. Although both countries used NTSC, there could be compatibility issues with certain televisions, potentially requiring additional adapters or modifications. Moreover, the Famicom's AC adapter was rated for Japan's 100V electrical outlets, unlike the 120V standard in the US, necessitating a voltage converter.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven these challenges, it is safe to conclude that obtaining a Japanese Famicom and its games in the United States during the 1980s would have been a daunting task for the average consumer. It would have required a significant effort, including overcoming language and technical barriers, and would generally have been limited to the most dedicated or well-connected fans of video games. As for the likelihood of an American knowing about the Famicom, it would have been relatively low for the general public until perhaps later in the decade, as the global video game culture continued to grow and information became slightly more accessible through magazines and early video game conventions. For the majority, the Famicom would simply not have been on their radar, with their primary exposure to Nintendo being through the American NES."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user asked about the version of the AI and whether it was GPT-4.

One of its functions was to oversee the administration of former territories of the defeated Central Powers, primarily the Ottoman Empire and Germany.\n\nThe system of \"mandates\" was created to administer these territories not yet considered able to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world, according to the preamble of the League of Nations Covenant. The idea was to govern these regions in a way that would prepare them for self-government under the auspices of the mandatory power, with the ultimate goal being self-determination.\n\nIn 1920, at the San Remo conference, it was decided that the United Kingdom would be given the mandate to govern Palestine. The official Mandate for Palestine was confirmed by the League of Nations in 1922. The term \"Mandatory Palestine\" comes from this legal arrangement, indicating that the territory of Palestine was being administered under the mandate system by Britain until it could stand independently. Under this arrangement, Britain had the responsibility to build institutions for a future independent state and facilitate the establishment of a \"national home for the Jewish people\" in Palestine, as stated in the Balfour Declaration of 1917, all while ensuring that the civil and religious rights of the existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine were not prejudiced."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user asked about the first idleRPG network and the AI provided a factual response.

There are several key reasons for its negative reception:\n\n1. **High System Requirements**: Upon its release in January 2007, Windows Vista demanded significantly higher hardware specifications from computers than its predecessor, Windows XP. Many existing PCs that were capable of running XP smoothly struggled with Vista, leading to poor performance and dissatisfaction among users. This was particularly noticeable in areas like system boot time, application launch times, and general responsiveness.\n\n2. **Compatibility Issues**: A lot of existing software and hardware that worked seamlessly with Windows XP faced compatibility problems with Vista. This included popular applications and drivers for peripherals. Although such compatibility issues are not uncommon with the release of a new OS, the scale and impact were notably problematic with Vista, affecting both personal and business users.\n\n3. **User Account Control (UAC)**: While intended to improve security by preventing unauthorized changes to the system, the implementation of UAC in Vista was widely criticized. Users found themselves bombarded with prompts asking for permission to continue with basic tasks, which became a source of frustration and led many to disable the feature altogether, ironically making their systems less secure.\n\n4. **Software Bloat and Resource Intensiveness**: Vista introduced a range of new features, including the Aero graphical interface, which, while visually appealing, contributed to the system's heavy resource use. Many criticized Vista for being bloated, as it came packed with features and services that many users found unnecessary, further straining system resources and affecting performance.\n\n5. **Initial Instability and Bugs**: Early versions of Vista were plagued by stability issues and bugs. Although many of these were addressed in subsequent updates and the release of Service Pack 1, the negative impression had already taken root among the user base.\n\n6. **Bad Timing and Poor Public Perception**: Vista's launch came at a time when Windows XP had become deeply entrenched and widely appreciated for its stability and relatively modest system requirements. The stark contrast in performance and compatibility issues made the transition to Vista difficult for many, and negative word-of-mouth spread quickly.\n\nOver time, Microsoft addressed many of Vista's flaws with patches and the much-improved Service Pack 1 and Service Pack 2 updates. However, Vista's reputation never fully recovered, and many users either stuck with Windows XP or waited for its successor, Windows 7, which rectified many of Vista's missteps and was much better received by both critics and the general public upon its release in 2009.\n\nIt's also worth noting that perceptions of \"the worst Windows version\" can vary based on individual and collective experiences. For example, Windows ME (Millennium Edition) also often features in discussions about less favorable versions of Windows due to its instability and problems."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user asked about the basketball season in Japan.

A minimalist approach not only saves time but also ensures efficiency without sacrificing quality. Let's delve into several effective tools and tactics.\n\n### Tools\n\n1. **Canva:** Ideal for non-designers, Canva simplifies graphic creation with its drag-and-drop interface and plethora of templates. From social media graphics to simple videos, it caters to a wide array of needs.\n\n2. **Grammarly:** This tool is indispensable for content writers aiming for clarity and conciseness. Grammarly's AI-powered writing assistant helps in eliminating errors and refining the tone of your content.\n\n3. **Buffer or Hootsuite:** These tools streamline social media management. With capabilities for scheduling posts across multiple platforms, they save time and ensure a consistent online presence.\n\n4. **Google Docs:** Its simplicity for drafting and collaborative features make it a go-to for content teams. The \u2018Suggestion\u2019 mode allows for seamless editing and feedback processes.\n\n5. **Trello or Asana:** For managing content calendars and tracking project progress, these tools are incredibly useful. They facilitate a clear overview of tasks, deadlines, and collaborations.\n\n### Tactics\n\n1. **Content Batching:** This involves dedicating blocks of time to produce a batch of content at once. For example, shooting multiple videos or writing several blog posts in a day. It's more efficient than tackling tasks one at a time and helps maintain a consistent content flow.\n\n2. **Repurposing Content:** Turn a blog post into multiple smaller pieces, such as social media posts, infographics, or even short video snippets. This maximizes exposure without the need for constantly creating new content from scratch.\n\n3. **Minimalist Writing:** Keep your message clear and concise. Avoid fluff and focus on delivering value. Not every piece needs to be an epic; sometimes, shorter, impactful content resonates better.\n\n4. **Leveraging User-Generated Content:** Encourage your audience to create content for you. Whether it's reviews, testimonials, or creative submissions, it not only engages your community but also supplies authentic content.\n\n5. **Automate When Possible:** Use automation tools for repetitive tasks. For example, automate email newsletters with RSS feeds or set up chatbots to answer frequently asked questions on your social media channels.\n\nStreamlining content creation isn't merely about using the right tools but also about adopting strategies that make the process more efficient. Implementing these tools and tactics will not only free up valuable time but also help in maintaining a consistent and engaging online presence."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user sought assistance with text processing and similarity matching, asking for guidance on filtering dates and finding similar questions.

While creating embeddings for all data at once from a CSV column is a straightforward approach, there are several strategies you can employ to improve efficiency, manage resources better, or potentially enhance the quality of your embeddings:\n\n1. **Batch Processing**: Instead of processing the entire dataset at once, break down the data into smaller batches. This approach helps in managing memory usage and can also make it easier to track and debug issues with specific subsets of your data. Many deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch support batch processing out-of-the-box.\n\n2. **Incremental Updates**: If your dataset frequently receives new data entries, consider implementing an incremental update mechanism. Instead of re-calculating embeddings for the entire dataset, you would only compute embeddings for new or updated entries. This approach can significantly save computational resources over time.\n\n3. **Distributed Computing**: For very large datasets, consider using distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark or Dask. These frameworks can process data in parallel across multiple machines, drastically reducing the time required to generate embeddings. Some deep learning libraries also support distributed training directly.\n\n4. **Embedding Storage and Retrieval**: If you find yourself generating the same embeddings repeatedly, it might be beneficial to store them persistently (e.g., in a database or file storage system) after the initial computation. This way, you can simply retrieve the pre-computed embeddings when needed. Consider using a format like HDF5 for efficient storage and retrieval of large numerical arrays.\n\n5. **Fine-tuning Pre-trained Models**: If you're using a pre-trained model to generate embeddings, fine-tuning it with a small subset of your specific domain data can sometimes yield better embeddings than using the generic model directly. This process involves continuing the training of the pre-trained model on your data, allowing it to better capture domain-specific nuances.\n\n6. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Depending on your use case, reducing the dimensionality of your embeddings can improve the performance of your similarity model and decrease storage requirements. Techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis), t-SNE, or autoencoders could be useful here. However, be mindful that reducing dimensionality might also lead to loss of information.\n\n7. **GPU Acceleration**: If you're not already doing so, leveraging GPU acceleration can significantly speed up the generation of embeddings, especially when using deep learning models. Libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch can automatically take advantage of GPU resources when available.\n\n8. **Optimize Model Architecture**: If you're training your own model to generate embeddings, ensuring that the model architecture is optimized for your specific task can lead to more efficient training and potentially better embeddings. This might involve experimenting with different architectures, layer types, and hyperparameters.\n\nBy implementing one or more of these strategies, you can optimize the process of creating embeddings from CSV data for your similarity model, making it faster, more efficient, or potentially more accurate."}, {"role": "user", "content": "i need to improve accuracy"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Improving the accuracy of your similarity model, which presumably relies on embeddings generated from your data, involves several interconnected strategies. From data pre-processing to model refinement, each step can contribute significantly to the overall performance. Here's a multifaceted approach to consider:\n\n### 1. Data Quality and Preprocessing\n- **Enhance Data Quality**: Ensure the data you're using to train your model is high-quality, relevant, and diverse enough to cover the scenarios your model might encounter.\n- **Augmentation**: Consider data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of your training data without manually collecting more data.\n- **Normalization/Standardization**: For numerical data, normalization or standardization can help improve model performance. For text, ensure consistent casing, and consider lemmatization or stemming. \n\n### 2. Feature Engineering\n- **Improve Embeddings**: If you're using pre-trained embeddings, experiment with different sources or types (e.g., GloVe, FastText, BERT for text) to see which gives better results for your use case.\n- **Custom Embeddings**: Train your embeddings on your domain-specific dataset. Custom embeddings can capture nuances more relevant to your particular use case.\n- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Experiment with reducing the dimensionality of your embeddings. While too much reduction can lose information, finding the right balance can improve model performance by focusing on the most relevant information.\n\n### 3. Model Architecture and Training Techniques\n- **Experiment with Architectures**: If you're using neural networks, experimenting with different architectures (e.g., CNNs, RNNs, Transformers for text) might reveal a better fit for your data.\n- **Fine-tuning**: Fine-tune pre-trained models rather than training from scratch or using them out-of-the-box. This can leverage the general understanding of the pre-trained model, adapting it specifically to your dataset.\n- **Loss Functions and Optimizers**: Experiment with different loss functions and optimizers. Some may converge faster or avoid local minima more effectively.\n- **Regularization**: Apply techniques like dropout, L2 regularization, etc., to prevent overfitting and make the model generalize better to unseen data.\n\n### 4. Training Data and Techniques\n- **More Data**: If possible, increase the size of your training dataset. More data can help the model learn more about the variability and complexity of the problem space.\n- **Data Sampling Strategies**: Implement balanced sampling or weighted loss functions to handle imbalanced datasets, ensuring that the model doesn't become biased towards the majority class.\n- **Cross-validation**: Use cross-validation to ensure that your model's performance is robust and doesn't depend heavily on the specific way your data is split.\n\n### 5. Hyperparameter Tuning\n- **Systematic Search**: Use grid search or random search to systematically explore the hyperparameter space. Consider automated hyperparameter optimization technologies like Bayesian optimization for more efficiency.\n- **Learning Rate Schedules**: Experiment with adaptive learning rates or learning rate schedules to improve convergence and model performance.\n\n### 6. Evaluation and Iteration\n- **Evaluation Metrics**: Make sure you're using the right metrics for your problem space. Precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC are common choices, but the right one depends on your specific application.\n- **Error Analysis**: After evaluating the model, perform an error analysis to understand the kind of mistakes it's making. This can inform your next steps, whether they're collecting more data for underperforming classes or modifying the model architecture.\n\n### 7. External Feedback\n- **Expert Input**: If possible, get input from domain experts on your model's output to identify potential improvements.\n- **User Feedback**: Implement a mechanism to collect user feedback on the model's performance in real-world scenarios, which can be invaluable for continuous improvement.\n\nImproving the accuracy of a model is typically an iterative process of hypothesis, experimentation, and refinement. Given the complexity and variety of models and problem spaces, what works for one scenario might not work for another, so be prepared for a process of exploration and learning."}, {"role": "user", "content": "find all the dates in a string,date can be in any format"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Extracting dates from a string when the format of the dates can vary significantly is a non-trivial task. This is because dates can be represented in numerous ways, including different separators, order of day/month/year, and variations in the representation of the month (numeric, short name, full name) among others.\n\nTo address this problem, especially in a programming context, we can consider using regular expressions (regex) for patterns that match common date formats or leveraging natural language processing (NLP) libraries designed to detect and parse entities in text, including dates.\n\n### Using Regular Expressions\n\nRegular expressions offer a powerful way to match string patterns, but given the wide variety of date formats, creating a regex pattern to match all possible date variations is quite complex and might not be 100% accurate for all cases. However, here's an example Python code snippet that covers several common date formats:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef find_dates(text):\n    # Regex patterns to match various date formats\n    # Example patterns: DD-MM-YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, DD.MM.YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD, MM-DD-YYYY, Month DD, YYYY, etc.\n    patterns = [\n        r'\\b\\d{1,2}[-/\\.]\\d{1,2}[-/\\.]\\d{2,4}\\b',  # DD-MM-YYYY or variations\n        r'\\b\\d{2,4}[-/\\.]\\d{1,2}[-/\\.]\\d{1,2}\\b',  # YYYY-MM-DD or variations\n        r'\\b(?:Jan(?:uary)?|Feb(?:ruary)?|Mar(?:ch)?|Apr(?:il)?|May|Jun(?:e)?|Jul(?:y)?|Aug(?:ust)?|Sep(?:tember)?|Oct(?:ober)?|Nov(?:ember)?|Dec(?:ember)?)\\s+\\d{1,2},?\\s+\\d{4}\\b',  # Month DD, YYYY\n        r'\\b\\d{1,2}\\s+(?:Jan(?:uary)?|Feb(?:ruary)?|Mar(?:ch)?|Apr(?:il)?|May|Jun(?:e)?|Jul(?:y)?|Aug(?:ust)?|Sep(?:tember)?|Oct(?:ober)?|Nov(?:ember)?|Dec(?:ember)?)\\s+\\d{2,4}\\b'  # DD Month YYYY\n    ]\n    \n    # Combine all patterns and search in the provided text\n    combined_pattern = '|'.join(patterns)\n    matches = re.findall(combined_pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE)\n    \n    return matches\n\n# Example usage\ntext = \"Today's date is 04/27/2023, and tomorrow will be April 28, 2023.

These libraries attempt to parse dates from strings intelligently by recognizing various date formats automatically.\n\n#### Using `dateparser`:\n\n```python\n!pip install dateparser\n\nimport dateparser\n\ndef find_dates_with_dateparser(text):\n    # This approach tries to parse each word to find dates, which may not be very efficient for long texts.\n    words = text.split()\n    dates = []\n    for word in words:\n        try:\n            parsed_date = dateparser.parse(word)\n            if parsed_date:\n                dates.append(parsed_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))\n        except:\n            pass\n    return dates\n\n# Example usage\ntext = \"Today's date is 04/27/2023, and tomorrow will be April 28, 2023. Other formats include 2022-12-31, 31.12.2022, Sep 5 2020, and 1st Jan 2021.\"\nfound_dates = find_dates_with_dateparser(text)\nprint(\"Found dates:\", found_dates)\n```\n\nNote: When using libraries like `dateparser`, it's important to test and validate the results thoroughly since automatic parsing might sometimes lead to incorrect interpretations, especially in texts with numbers that could be misinterpreted as dates.\n\nEach approach has its pros and cons. Regular expressions offer more control but require thorough testing and adjustment to cover various formats. Libraries like `dateparser` provide convenience and flexibility at the cost of potential misinterpretations, which should be taken into account depending on the requirements of your project.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "i am using date finder and gettig good response for date\nimport datefinder\ndates = datefinder.find_dates(usertext)\n    for date in dates:\n        print(date)\n\nanswer is in the format 2022-01-05 00:00:00 by above mentioned code.\nI need to mach this date with 05-Jan-2022\nthis format date and filter all data from a clumn in dataframe where date matches this date"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you're working with Python and have extracted dates using the `datefinder` library and now want to filter a pandas DataFrame for rows matching a specific date in a different format (`05-Jan-2022`), you can follow these steps:\n\n1.

Filter the DataFrame based on the matching date.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide using a sample DataFrame:\n\n### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment\n\nFirst, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. If not, you can install them using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install pandas datefinder\n```\n\n### Step 2: Convert Found Dates to Desired Format\n\nWhen you extract dates using `datefinder`, you can convert them into the format `DD-Mon-YYYY` using Python's `datetime` module:\n\n```python\nimport datefinder\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nusertext = \"The event was held on 05-Jan-2022, and it was a success.\"\n\ndates = datefinder.find_dates(usertext)\nfor date in dates:\n    formatted_date = date.strftime(\"%d-%b-%Y\")\n    print(formatted_date)  # Example: \"05-Jan-2022\"\n```\n\n### Step 3: Prepare Your DataFrame\n\nLet's assume you have a pandas DataFrame with a column named `EventDate` that you want to filter:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'Event': ['Event1', 'Event2', 'Event3'],\n    'EventDate': ['04-Jan-2022', '05-Jan-2022', '06-Jan-2022']\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\nprint(df)\n```\n\n### Step 4: Filter the DataFrame\n\nBefore filtering, ensure the `EventDate` column is in the same format as your target date. In this case, it already is. If not, you'd use `pd.to_datetime(df['EventDate']).dt.strftime('%d-%b-%Y')` to convert it.\n\nHere's how to filter the DataFrame for a specific date:\n\n```python\n# Assuming 'formatted_date' is the date you extracted and formatted as \"05-Jan-2022\"\ntarget_date = '05-Jan-2022'\n\n# Direct comparison because both the target date and DataFrame dates are strings in the same format.\nfiltered_df = df[df['EventDate'] == target_date]\n\nprint(filtered_df)\n```\n\nThis will give you all rows in `df` where the `EventDate` matches the `target_date` you specified.\n\n### Note:\n\n- The extraction of dates and their formatting should be tested thoroughly, as textual dates can be written in many forms, and `datefinder` might interpret them differently depending on the context.\n- When working with real-world data, there might be unexpected date formats or invalid data that you need to clean or preprocess before applying these filtering techniques."}, {"role": "user", "content": "after using filtered df like this,\ndef get_most_similar_question(userText,history):\n#     print('aaaaa',userText)\n    filtered_df = preporcess_input(userText)\n#     print('bbbbb',userText)\n# #     if not has_year(userText):\n# #         current_year = datetime.datetime.now().year\n# #         userText+=f\"{current_year}\"\n#     print('ccccc',userText)    \n#     print(userText)\n    filtered_df['Question'] = filtered_df['Question'].str.lower()\n    print(filtered_df.head())\n    data_list = filtered_df[\"Question\"].to_list()\n    fin = [re.sub(r'\\r\\n', '', line) for line in data_list]\n    data_emb = retrieval_model.encode(fin)\n\n    inp_emb = retrieval_model.encode([userText])\n    corr = np.inner(inp_emb, data_emb)\n    print(corr)\n    flat_list = [item for sublist in corr for item in sublist]\n#     print(flat_list)\n    top_1_idx = np.argsort(flat_list)[-1:]\n    print('dfdafdv',top_1_idx)\n    top_1_values = [flat_list[i] for i in top_1_idx]\n    print('dffdfdfdd',top_1_values)\n   \n    print(\"top_1_values\",top_1_values[0])\n    n_data = new_df.iloc[top_1_idx,[10]]\n    print('dfdf',n_data)\n    df_html_with_sql = n_data.to_html(index=False)\n    x = n_data.to_string(header=False, index=False, index_names=False).split('\\n')\n    print('ddfd',x)\n#     valf = [','.join(ele.split()) for ele in x]\n    return df_html_with_sql\n\ni need to find similarity oif usertext with that from thefiltered data question column"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your function `get_most_similar_question(userText, history)` is designed to find the most similar question from a DataFrame `filtered_df` based on the user input `userText`.

Here are a few enhancements and considerations to improve the robustness, user experience, and maintainability of your code:\n\n### Date Handling in User Text\n\nYou're extracting and using the first found date in `preporcess_input` function. It's a good practice to handle situations where no dates are found or multiple dates are detected:\n\n- **No Dates Detected**: Inform the user no valid date was found in their query when necessary.\n- **Multiple Dates Detected**: Decide on a policy (use the first date, inform the user to rephrase, etc.) and implement it accordingly.\n\n### Error Handling\n\nYour use of a `try-except` block in `get_most_similar_question` is a good practice. Ensure that any potential errors, especially from external libraries or DataFrame operations, are gracefully handled to enhance user experience.\n\n### User Feedback for No Matches\n\nYou might also want to handle the case where a date is correctly found and formatted, but there's no matching data in your DataFrame. Providing specific feedback that no data is available for the provided date can guide users on how to modify their queries.\n\n### Code Optimization and Readability\n\n- **DataFrame Operations**: Ensure operations like `to_datetime` conversion and string formatting are done efficiently. Consider performing these operations once during DataFrame initialization or loading instead of within a function called multiple times.\n- **Variable Scope and Usage**: Ensure that variables like `formatted_date` are properly scoped and used. In the current implementation, `formatted_date` might raise a `UnboundLocalError` if used before assignment (in case no dates are found).\n\n### Enhanced Authentication\n\nWhile the basic authentication mechanism is a good start, consider enhancing security for real-world applications. Storing passwords in plaintext, even in a demonstration, is not recommended.\n\n### Example Enhancements\n\nLet\u2019s integrate the feedback and possible error or edge case handling into your `preprocess_input` function as an example of how to better handle date extraction and matching:\n\n```python\ndef preprocess_input(usertext):\n    usertext = usertext.lower()\n   \n    dates = list(datefinder.find_dates(usertext))\n    if not dates:\n        return None, \"No valid date found in your query.\"\n    \n    formatted_date = dates[0].strftime(\"%d-%b-%Y\")  # Using the first detected date\n    print(formatted_date)\n    \n    # Filter DataFrame for matching date\n    filtered_df = new_df[new_df['date'] == formatted_date]\n\n    if filtered_df.empty:\n        return None, f\"Data is not available for this date: {formatted_date}.\"\n    \n    print(filtered_df.shape)\n    return filtered_df, None\n\n# In get_most_similar_question(), you need to handle the case where preprocess_input()\n# returns None and a message, and pass that message back to the user instead of proceeding with similarity search.\n```\n\n### Gradio Interface Considerations\n\nFinally, when launching the Gradio interface with authentication, test the entire interaction flow to ensure that it's smooth and intuitive. Document examples of valid queries to guide users on how to interact with your application effectively.\n\nRemember, continual testing and user feedback are key to refining and improving interactive applications."}, {"role": "user", "content": "give me complete code"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Below is an integrated solution that takes into consideration the discussed enhancements, including improved date handling, feedback for no matches, and capturing multiple potential error scenarios. \n\nThis example maintains the structure of your original code but adds additional checks and feedback mechanisms to better handle situations where data might not be available for a specified date or when no dates are detected in the user query.\n\nPlease make sure you've installed all necessary packages like `pandas`, `numpy`, `datefinder`, `sentence-transformers`, and `gradio` before running the code.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport datetime\nimport datefinder\nimport re\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nimport gradio as gr\n\n# Load the model\nretrieval_model_path = \"your_model_path_here\"  # Update this with your model path\nretrieval_model = SentenceTransformer(retrieval_model_path)\n\n# Load and preprocess your data\ndata = pd.read_csv('./Data/dataaa.txt', sep=\"\\t\", header=None)\nheaders = data.iloc[0]\nnew_df = pd.DataFrame(data.values[1:], columns=headers)\nnew_df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(new_df['date']).dt.strftime('%d-%b-%Y')  # Format date\n\ndef preprocess_input(usertext):\n    usertext = usertext.lower()\n    dates = list(datefinder.find_dates(usertext))\n    \n    if not dates:  # If no date is found\n        return None, \"No valid date found in your query.\"\n    \n    formatted_date = dates[0].strftime(\"%d-%b-%Y\")  # Use the first detected date\n    filtered_df = new_df[new_df['date'] == formatted_date]  # Filter DataFrame for matching date\n    \n    if filtered_df.empty:  # If no matching data is found for the date\n        return None, f\"Data is not available for this date: {formatted_date}.\"\n    \n    return filtered_df, None\n\ndef get_most_similar_question(userText):\n    filtered_df, message = preprocess_input(userText)\n    \n    if filtered_df is None:  # Handle when no valid date or no data for date\n        return message\n    \n    # Preprocess the filtered DataFrame\n    filtered_df['Question'] = filtered_df['Question'].str.lower()\n    data_list = filtered_df[\"Question\"].to_list()\n    data_emb = retrieval_model.encode(data_list)\n    inp_emb = retrieval_model.encode([userText.lower()])\n\n    # Calculate similarity\n    corr = np.inner(inp_emb, data_emb)\n    flat_list = corr.flatten()\n    top_1_idx = np.argmax(flat_list)\n    \n    if flat_list[top_1_idx] == 0:  # If there is no similarity found\n        return \"Sorry, but no similar questions were found for your query.\"\n    \n    n_data = filtered_df.iloc[top_1_idx]\n    df_html_with_sql = n_data.to_frame().T.to_html(index=False)\n    \n    return df_html_with_sql\n\n# Authentication for Gradio Interface\ndummy_users = [\n    {\"username\": \"jatin\", \"password\": \"qwer@345\"},\n    {\"username\": \"ajoy\", \"password\": \"qwer@345\"},\n    # Add more dummy users as needed\n]\n\ndef authenticate_user(username, password):\n    for user in dummy_users:\n        if user[\"username\"] == username and user[\"password\"] == password:\n            return True\n    return False\n\n# Gradio Interface\ngr.Interface(fn=get_most_similar_question,\n             inputs=gr.inputs.Textbox(label=\"Enter Your Query\"),\n             outputs=\"html\",\n             auth=authenticate_user,\n             examples=[\"All India sales value for 05-Jan-2022\", \"GT sellout value for 05 Dec 2024\"]).launch(share=True)\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `\"your_model_path_here\"` with the actual path to your Sentence Transformer model.\n\nThis code integrates feedback when no dates are detected or when there's no available data for a given date.

Based on whether a date is found:\n\n- **A Date Is Found**: Filter the DataFrame for that specific date.\n- **No Date Found**: Focus on rows marked as `'NO_DATE'`.\n\nAssuming you're still utilizing the `datefinder` library to parse dates in user queries and the `sentence-transformers` library for retrieving the most similar question, here\u2019s how you\u2019d adjust your processing function:\n\n```python\nimport datefinder\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\n\nretrieval_model = SentenceTransformer('your_model_path_here')\n\ndef preprocess_input(user_text):\n    # Attempt to find dates in the user_text\n    dates = list(datefinder.find_dates(user_text))\n    \n    if dates:\n        # If a date is found, use the first one\n        formatted_date = dates[0].strftime('%d-%b-%Y')\n        # Filter DataFrame for this specific date\n        filtered_df = new_df[new_df['date'] == formatted_date]\n    else:\n        # If no dates found, focus on entries marked 'NO_DATE'\n        filtered_df = new_df[new_df['date'] == 'NO_DATE']\n        \n    return filtered_df\n\ndef get_most_similar_question(user_text):\n    filtered_df = preprocess_input(user_text.lower())\n    \n    if filtered_df.empty:\n        return \"No matching data found for your query.\"\n    \n    # Further processing here, such as converting to lowercase, encoding, finding similarity score, etc.\n    # Placeholder for the similarity logic you've implemented\n    return \"Placeholder - insert similarity logic and response formatting here.\"\n```\n\nRemember to replace `'your_model_path_here'` with the actual path to your trained Sentence Transformer model.\n\nBy following these steps, you ensure that your application robustly handles variations in the presence of date information within both user queries and your dataset, allowing for accurate filtering and retrieval of relevant questions."}, {"role": "user", "content": "need check for valid date,invalid date and no date"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To adequately handle different date conditions in user inputs \u2014 specifically, checking for valid dates, invalid dates, and the absence of dates \u2014 you can leverage Python's `dateutil.parser` along with custom logic. This approach enables more fine-grained control over date validation before proceeding with data filtering or similarity checks in your dataset.\n\nHere's a structured way to implement these checks in your system:\n\n### Step 1: Install the Required Package\n\nIf you haven't installed `dateutil` yet, you can do so using pip:\n\n```sh\npip install python-dateutil\n```\n\n### Step 2: Define a Function to Check Date Validity\n\nThis function attempts to parse a date from the input text. It differentiates between valid dates, invalid dates, and inputs with no date.\n\n```python\nfrom dateutil.parser import parse, ParserError\n\ndef assess_date(input_text):\n    try:\n        # Attempt to find and parse dates within the input text\n        dates = list(datefinder.find_dates(input_text))\n        if not dates:\n            raise ValueError(\"No dates found.\")\n            \n        # Assuming we use the first date found for simplicity\n        first_date_found = dates[0]\n        \n        # Validate if the parsed date is reasonable (e.g., not in the far future)\n        current_year = datetime.datetime.now().year\n        if first_date_found.year > current_year + 1:\n            return None, \"Invalid date: Year is too far in the future.\"\n        \n        # Return the first valid date found\n        return first_date_found.strftime('%d-%b-%Y'), None\n    \n    except ValueError as e:\n        # Handles the case where no dates are identified\n        return None, str(e)\n    except ParserError:\n        # Handles the case where date parsing fails\n        return None, \"Invalid date format.\"\n```\n\n### Step 3: Integrate Date Validation into Your Preprocessing Logic\n\nUse the `assess_date` function within your preprocessing step to ensure only valid dates are used to filter your DataFrame or to recognize when to filter for data without specific dates.\n\n```python\ndef preprocess_input(user_text, df):\n    date_str, error_message = assess_date(user_text)\n    \n    if error_message:\n        # Could return the error along with a flag (e.g., True if 'No dates found.') to handle logic downstream\n        return None, error_message\n    \n    if date_str:\n        # Filter for rows matching the validated date\n        filtered_df = df[df['date'] == date_str]\n    else:\n        # Focus on entries without a specific date\n        filtered_df = df[df['date'] == 'NO_DATE']\n\n    if filtered_df.empty:\n        return None, \"No matching data found for your query.\"\n        \n    return filtered_df, None\n```\n\n### Step 4: Enhanced Input Handling in the Primary Function\n\nIntegrate the date validation in your primary logic, making adjustments based on the results of the date assessment (i.e., handling valid dates, invalid dates, and the absence of dates accordingly).\n\n```python\ndef get_most_similar_question(user_text, df):\n    filtered_df, error_or_message = preprocess_input(user_text.lower(), df)\n    \n    if error_or_message:\n        return error_or_message\n    \n    # Proceed with your similarity checks and other logic if `filtered_df` is valid\n    # (Placeholder for your existing logic)\n    \n    return \"Placeholder for similarity results or a specific message.\"\n```\n\nThis setup provides a comprehensive method to manage dates within user inputs, allowing for detailed feedback and proper data handling based on the presence or validity of dates. You can further refine the `assess_date` and `preprocess_input` functions according to your specific application needs, such as by customizing error messages or adjusting the date validation criteria."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user requested a technical construction report with specific details, requiring careful parsing and concise formatting.

So, we'll focus on a generalized process that you could follow, keeping in mind the specifics cannot be exactly produced here without the direct data, HBV-Light software, and geographical specifics. Let's tackle it step by step.\n\n### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing\n\nFirstly, you'll need to gather the necessary data:\n- **Streamflow data**: Obtain from the Water Survey of Canada gauging station.\n- **Meteorological data**: Monthly average PET (Potential Evapotranspiration) values, which can be estimated from lake evaporation climate normals produced by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC).\n- **Other relevant data**: This might include precipitation, temperature (if not implicitly covered by PET), and any other relevant data suggested by HBV-Light requirements.\n\n### 2. HBV-Light Model Setup\n\n- **Install HBV-Light**: Make sure that HBV-Light is properly installed on your computer.\n- **Input data preparation**: Format the collected data according to HBV-Light's requirements.\n- **Model configuration**: Set up the HBV-Light model for your specific watershed. This would involve defining the catchment area, dividing the catchment into sub-catchments if necessary, and setting initial guesses for the model parameters.\n\n### 3. Calibration Process\n\n- **Initial parameter estimation**: Make educated guesses for the initial parameters based on literature or similar catchment characteristics.\n- **Run the model**: Execute the simulation with the initial parameters.\n- **Iterative calibration**: Use HBV-Light's calibration tools to adjust the parameters iteratively. This stage requires comparing the model output with observed streamflows and adjusting the parameters to improve the fit.\n- **Parameter Optimization**: Utilize automatic calibration tools if available, aiming to minimize the difference between observed and simulated streamflows.\n\n### 4. Output Generation and Analysis\n\n**a. Graphical Illustration of the Model Fit**\n\nGenerate graphical outputs using HBV-Light, focusing on comparing the observed vs. simulated streamflows over the calibration period. You must ensure the time series plots neatly depict both sets of data for a direct visual comparison.\n\n**b. Table with Calibrated Parameter Values**\n\nCreate a simple table listing each parameter you've calibrated, including its initial value, calibrated value, and possibly a brief note on its influence on model output. For example:\n\n| Parameter | Initial Value | Calibrated Value | Notes |\n|---------------|----------------|-------------------|-------|\n| MAXBAS  | xx | xx | Controls baseflow |\n| FC          | xx | xx | Field capacity |\n\n**c. Discussion on Goodness of Fit**\n\nFor the discussion:\n- Start by briefly describing the calibration process and the adjustments made to the parameter values.\n- Reference statistical goodness of fit parameters such as the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Percent Bias (PBIAS). Explain what these values imply about the model's performance.\n- Link back to your graphical illustration. Discuss specific periods where the model achieved a good fit and periods where it didn't. Explore potential reasons for any discrepancies, such as data quality issues or model limitations.\n- Conclude by summarizing the overall performance of the model and any recommendations for improving the simulation.\n\n### Note\n\nRemember, this guide provides a theoretical pathway for model calibration. Actual implementation will depend on specific data, watershed characteristics, and the peculiarities of using HBV-Light software. Always adhere to the software's user manual and best practices in hydrological modeling."}, {"role": "user", "content": "detailed step by step for 2 and 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Implementing and calibrating a hydrological model like HBV-Light involves detailed technical steps. Below is a more detailed guide highlighting the setup and calibration steps for HBV-Light focused on a hypothetical scenario like the North Brook at Sheffield Mills watershed. Actual implementation might vary based on specific software versions and available data.\n\n### Step 2: HBV-Light Model Setup\n\n**2.1 Installation**:\n- Ensure HBV-Light is correctly installed on your system. Installation details vary, so follow the provided guidelines or installer instructions.\n\n**2.2 Input Data**:\n- **Streamflow Data**: Import the streamflow data from the Water Survey of Canada gauging station. This usually involves formatting the data into a CSV or similar format that HBV-Light can process.\n- **Meteorological Data**: Prepare your meteorological data (monthly average PET, and if available, precipitation, and temperature data) according to HBV-Light's requirements. This often involves matching the timestamps/formatting of your meteorological data to what HBV-Light accepts.\n\n**2.3 Model Configuration**:\n1. **Catchment Delineation**: Define your catchment area within HBV-Light. If your study area consists of multiple sub-catchments, you'll need to delineate these within the software.\n2. **Setting Up Time Steps**: Configure the time step of your simulation according to your data granularity and model goals. Monthly time steps might be suitable for your PET data.\n3. **Parameter Initialization**: Input initial guesses for HBV parameters. Common parameters include soil moisture storage capacity, baseflow parameters, and threshold temperatures for snow processes. Initial values can be estimated based on literature or previous studies in similar watersheds.\n\n### Step 3: Calibration Process\n\n**3.1 Initial Calibration**:\n- Run your model with the initial parameter set. Analyze the output comparing observed vs. simulated streamflows to identify discrepancies.\n\n**3.2 Iterative Calibration**:\n- **Manual Tuning**: Adjust parameters manually based on their hydrological impact and rerun the model. For example, if the simulated peak flows are consistently too high, you might consider adjusting parameters affecting runoff generation and peak flow attenuation.\n- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Before diving deep into calibration, it might be beneficial to conduct a sensitivity analysis to understand which parameters your model output is most sensitive to. This can guide you on which parameters to focus on during calibration.\n\n**3.3 Automatic Calibration**:\n- HBV-Light may offer tools or plugins for automatic calibration, where the software automatically adjusts parameters to improve fit based on an objective function, such as minimizing the RMSE or maximizing the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency score.\n- Configure the automatic calibration tool by selecting your objective function(s) and setting the bounds or limits for parameter adjustments.\n- Run the automatic calibration. This might take several iterations and possibly significant computational time, depending on model complexity and length of the calibration period.\n\n**3.4 Validation**:\n- After achieving a satisfactory calibration, it\u2019s critical to validate the model with a different time period. This ensures that your model can generalize well to conditions not seen during the calibration phase.\n\n**3.5 Fine-Tuning**:\n- Based on the validation results, further fine-tuning of parameters might be necessary. This could involve minor adjustments to parameters or re-running automatic calibration with a tighter focus.\n\n### Tips for Effective Calibration\n\n- Keep detailed records of each calibration attempt, including parameter values, objective function scores, and any notes on model performance.\n- Understand the physical meaning of each parameter. This knowledge is crucial when making manual adjustments and interpreting the model's behavior.\n- Be patient. Calibration can be a time-consuming process requiring many iterations to get right.\n\nThis guidance aims to provide a foundational approach to setting up and calibrating the HBV-Light model for a specific watershed.

The density of seawater is primarily influenced by its temperature, salinity, and to a lesser extent, pressure. Warmer or less salty water is less dense and tends to float on top of colder or saltier water. \n\n32) To approximate the density of the Oyashio Current with a salinity of 33.6 PSU and a temperature of 5\u00b0C, we can refer to the UNESCO International Equation of State of Seawater (often simplified for educational purposes). However, without direct calculation tables or tools here, precise density values can be challenging to provide. Generally, cooler and moderately saline water like that in the Oyashio Current would have a higher density compared to warmer, less saline water. In typical conditions at sea level and factoring in the given parameters, we might estimate its density to be around 1027 kg/m\u00b3 to 1028 kg/m\u00b3, but it's important to note this is a rough approximation.\n\n33) Similarly, for the Kuroshio Current with a salinity of 34.5 PSU and a temperature of 20\u00b0C, applying the same principles indicates that this water would be less dense than the Oyashio Current due to its higher temperature, despite having a slightly higher salinity. Its density might be approximately in the range of 1024 kg/m\u00b3 to 1025 kg/m\u00b3, understanding again this is an approximation without precise calculations.\n\n34) When the Oyashio Current (colder and relatively fresh) encounters the Kuroshio Current (warmer and saltier) southeast of Hokkaido, the denser Oyashio Current would be underneath the less dense Kuroshio Current due to the significant difference in temperature and slight difference in salinity, making the Kuroshio Current warmer, slightly more saline, and less dense in comparison.\n\n35) The reason the temperatures on the Japanese islands are much higher than those across the Sea of Japan can be attributed mainly to the influence of the Kuroshio Current. The Kuroshio Current, being a warm ocean current, brings warm water from the equatorial region northwards along the eastern coast of Asia, including the seas around the Japanese islands. This warm current influences the climate of the nearby land, raising the temperatures. On the other side, the Sea of Japan is more influenced by cold air masses from Siberia and less by the direct impact of warm ocean currents like the Kuroshio Current. During winter, the contrast becomes even more pronounced due to the Siberian High affecting the Sea of Japan. Moreover, the prevailing wind patterns, including the monsoons, may contribute to this discrepancy in temperatures by carrying the air warmed by the Kuroshio Current over the land, further raising temperatures on the islands compared to across the Sea of Japan.\n\nWithout specific images referred to in the question, this answer relies on general principles of climatology and oceanography."}]}]}, {"summary": "The user asked about specific details from literary works, requiring accurate and concise information.

Weakness and tingling in your hands and feet are usually the first symptoms.\nThese sensations can quickly spread, eventually paralyzing your whole body. In its most severe form Guillain-Barre syndrome is a medical emergency. Most people with the condition must be hospitalized to receive treatment.\nSymptoms: Guillain-Barre syndrome often begins with tingling and weakness starting in your feet and legs and spreading to your upper body and arms. Some people notice the first symptoms in the arms or face. As Guillain-Barre syndrome progresses, muscle weakness can turn into paralysis.\nSigns and symptoms of Guillain-Barre syndrome may include:\n\u2022\tA pins and needles sensation in your fingers, toes, ankles or wrists\n\u2022\tWeakness in your legs that spreads to your upper body\n\u2022\tUnsteady walking or inability to walk or climb stairs\n\u2022\tDifficulty with facial movements, including speaking, chewing or swallowing\n\u2022\tDouble vision or inability to move the eyes\n\u2022\tSevere pain that may feel achy, shooting or cramplike and may be worse at night\n\u2022\tDifficulty with bladder control or bowel function\n\u2022\tRapid heart rate\n\u2022\tLow or high blood pressure\n\u2022\tDifficulty breathing\nPeople with Guillain-Barre syndrome usually experience their most significant weakness within two weeks after symptoms begin.\nRisk factors: Guillain-Barre syndrome can affect all age groups, but your risk increases as you age. It's also slightly more common in males than females.\nGuillain-Barre syndrome may be triggered by:\n\u2022\tMost commonly, infection with campylobacter, a type of bacteria often found in undercooked poultry\n\u2022\tInfluenza virus\n\u2022\tCytomegalovirus\n\u2022\tEpstein-Barr virus\n\u2022\tZika virus\n\u2022\tHepatitis A, B, C and E\n\u2022\tHIV, the virus that causes AIDS\n\u2022\tMycoplasma pneumonia\n\u2022\tSurgery\n\u2022\tTrauma\n\u2022\tHodgkin's lymphoma\n\u2022\tRarely, influenza vaccinations or childhood vaccinations\n\u2022\tCOVID-19 virus\n\u2022\tCOVID-19 Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccine.\nComplications:\nGuillain-Barre syndrome affects your nerves. Because nerves control your movements and body functions, people with Guillain-Barre may experience:\nBreathing difficulties: The weakness or paralysis can spread to the muscles that control your breathing, a potentially fatal complication. Up to 22% of people with Guillain-Barre syndrome need temporary help from a machine to breathe within the first week when they're hospitalized for treatment.\nResidual numbness or other sensations: Most people with Guillain-Barre syndrome recover completely or have only minor, residual weakness, numbness or tingling.\nHeart and blood pressure problems: Blood pressure fluctuations and irregular heart rhythms (cardiac arrhythmias) are common side effects of Guillain-Barre syndrome.\nPain: One-third of people with Guillain-Barre syndrome experience severe nerve pain, which may be eased with medication.\nBowel and bladder function problems: Sluggish bowel function and urine retention may result from Guillain-Barre syndrome.\nBlood clots: People who are immobile due to Guillain-Barre syndrome are at risk of developing blood clots. Until you're able to walk independently, taking blood thinners and wearing support stockings may be recommended.\nPressure sores: Being immobile also puts you at risk of developing bedsores (pressure sores). Frequent repositioning may help avoid this problem.\nRelapse: A small percentage of people with Guillain-Barre syndrome have a relapse, experiencing muscle weakness even years after the symptoms ended.\n Local (normal) Treatment:\nThere's no cure for Guillain-Barre syndrome. But two types of treatments can speed recovery and reduce the severity of the illness:\nPlasma exchange (plasmapheresis): The liquid portion of part of your blood (plasma) is removed and separated from your blood cells. The blood cells are then put back into your body, which manufactures more plasma to make up for what was removed. Plasmapheresis may work by ridding plasma of certain antibodies that contribute to the immune system's attack on the peripheral nerves.\nImmunoglobulin therapy: Immunoglobulin containing healthy antibodies from blood donors is given through a vein (intravenously). High doses of immunoglobulin can block the damaging antibodies that may contribute to Guillain-Barre syndrome. These treatments are equally effective. Mixing them or administering one after the other is no more effective than using either method alone.\nYou are also likely to be given medication to:\nRelieve pain, which can be severe\nPrevent blood clots, which can develop while you're immobile\nPeople with Guillain-Barre syndrome need physical help and therapy before and during recovery. Your care may include:\nMovement of your arms and legs by caregivers before recovery, to help keep your muscles flexible and strong.\nPhysical therapy during recovery to help you cope with fatigue and regain strength and proper movement.\nTraining with adaptive devices, such as a wheelchair or braces, to give you mobility and self-care skills.\nBackground:\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) can be described as a collection of clinical syndromes that manifests as an acute inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy with resultant weakness and diminished reflexes. With poliomyelitis under control in developed countries, GBS is now the most important cause of acute flaccid paralysis. (See Clinical Presentation.)\nAlthough the classic description of GBS is that of a demyelinating neuropathy with ascending weakness, many clinical variants have been well documented in the medical literature, and variants involving the cranial nerves or pure motor involvement and axonal injury are not uncommon. (See Pathophysiology.)\nAcute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) is the most widely recognized form of GBS in Western countries, but the variants known as acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), acute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN), and Miller-Fisher syndrome also are well recognized.\nBased on a clinical spectrum of symptoms and findings, it is widely believed that strictly defined subgroups of GBS exist. However, these subgroups are not easily distinguished.\nGBS remains a diagnosis made primarily through the assessment of clinical history and findings (see Clinical Presentation). Serum autoantibodies are not measured routinely in the workup of GBS, but results may be helpful in patients with a questionable diagnosis or a variant of GBS (see Workup).\nApproximately one third of patients require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), primarily because of respiratory failure. After medical stabilization, patients can be treated on a general medical/neurologic floor, but continued vigilance remains important in preventing respiratory, cardiovascular, and other medical complications. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or plasma exchange may hasten recovery. After discharge, outpatient physical therapy and occupational therapy may be beneficial in helping patients with GBS to regain their baseline functional status.\nHistorical background:\nIn 1859, Landry published a report on 10 patients with an ascending paralysis. Subsequently, in 1916, 3 French physicians (Guillain, Barr\u00e9, and Strohl) described 2 French soldiers with motor weakness, areflexia, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) albuminocytologic dissociation, and diminished deep tendon reflexes. The identified syndrome was later named Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Historically, GBS was a single disorder; however, current practice acknowledges several variant forms.\n\nPathophysiology:\nGBS is a postinfectious, immune-mediated disease. Cellular and humoral immune mechanisms probably play a role in its development. Most patients report an infectious illness in the weeks prior to the onset of GBS. Many of the identified infectious agents are thought to induce production of antibodies that cross-react with specific gangliosides and glycolipids, such as GM1 and GD1b, that are distributed throughout the myelin in the peripheral nervous system.\nThe pathophysiologic mechanism of an antecedent illness and of GBS can be typified by Campylobacter jejuni infections. The virulence of C jejuni is thought to be based on the presence of specific antigens in its capsule that are shared with nerves.\nImmune responses directed against lipopolysaccharide antigens in the capsule of C jejuni result in antibodies that cross-react with ganglioside GM1 in myelin, resulting in immunologic damage to the peripheral nervous system. This process has been termed molecular mimicry. \nPathologic findings in GBS include lymphocytic infiltration of spinal roots and peripheral nerves (cranial nerves may be involved as well), followed by macrophage-mediated, multifocal stripping of myelin. This phenomenon results in defects in the propagation of electrical nerve impulses, with eventual absence or profound delay in conduction, causing flaccid paralysis. Recovery is typically associated with remyelination.\nIn some patients with severe disease, a secondary consequence of the severe inflammation is axonal disruption and loss. A subgroup of patients may have a primary immune attack directly against nerve axons, with sparing of myelin. The clinical presentation in these patients is similar to that of the principal type.\n\n\nSubtypes of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome:\nSeveral variants of GBS are recognized. These disorders share similar patterns of evolution, symptom overlap, and probable immune-mediated pathogenesis. Recovery from them varies.\n\nAcute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy\nThe acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) subtype is the most commonly identified form in the United States. It is generally preceded by a bacterial or viral infection. Nearly 40% of patients with AIDP are seropositive for C jejuni. Lymphocytic infiltration and macrophage-mediated peripheral nerve demyelination is present. Symptoms generally resolve with remyelination.\n\nAcute motor axonal neuropathy\nThe acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) subtype is a purely motor disorder that is more prevalent in pediatric age groups.] AMAN is generally characterized by rapidly progressive symmetrical weakness and ensuing respiratory failure.\nNearly 70-75% of patients with AMAN are seropositive for Campylobacter, with the majority of cases of AMAN being associated with preceding C jejuni diarrhea. Patients typically have high titers of antibodies to gangliosides (ie, GM1, GD1a, GD1b). Inflammation of the spinal anterior roots may lead to disruption of the blood-CNS barrier. Biopsies show wallerianlike degeneration without significant lymphocytic inflammation.\nMany cases have been reported in rural areas of China, especially in children and young adults during the summer months. Pure axonal cases may occur more frequently outside of Europe and North America. AMAN cases may also be different from cases of axonal GBS described in the West.\nPrognosis is often quite favorable. Although recovery for many is rapid, severely disabled patients with AMAN may show improvement over a period of years.\nOne third of patients with AMAN may actually be hyperreflexic. Although the mechanism for this hyperreflexia is unclear, dysfunction of the inhibitory system via spinal interneurons may increase motor neuron excitability. Hyperreflexia is significantly associated with the presence of anti-GM1 antibodies. \n\nAcute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy\nAcute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN) is a severe acute illness differing from AMAN in that it also affects sensory nerves and roots. [17] Patients are typically adults. AMSAN often presents as rapid and severe motor and sensory dysfunction. Marked muscle wasting is characteristic, and recovery is poorer than it is from electrophysiologically similar cases of AMAN.\nAs with AMAN, AMSAN is often associated with preceding C jejuni diarrhea. Pathologic findings show severe axonal degeneration of motor and sensory nerve fibers with little demyelination.\n\nMiller-Fisher syndrome\nMiller-Fisher syndrome (MFS), which is observed in about 5% of all cases of GBS, classically presents as a triad of ataxia, areflexia, and ophthalmoplegia. Acute onset of external ophthalmoplegia is a cardinal feature. Ataxia tends to be out of proportion to the degree of sensory loss. Patients may also have mild limb weakness, ptosis, facial palsy, or bulbar palsy. Patients have reduced or absent sensory nerve action potentials and absent tibial H reflex.\nAnti-GQ1b antibodies are prominent in MFS, and have a relatively high specificity and sensitivity for the disease.Dense concentrations of GQ1b ganglioside are found in the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves, which may explain the relationship between anti-GQ1b antibodies and ophthalmoplegia. Patients with acute oropharyngeal palsy carry anti-GQ1b/GT1a IgG antibodies.Recovery generally occurs within 1-3 months.\n\nAcute panautonomic neuropathy\nAcute panautonomic neuropathy, the rarest GBS variant, involves the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Patients have severe postural hypotension, bowel and bladder retention, anhidrosis, decreased salivation and lacrimation, and pupillary abnormalities. Cardiovascular involvement is common, and dysrhythmias are a significant source of mortality. Significant motor or sensory involvement is lacking. Recovery is gradual and often incomplete.\n\nPure sensory GBS\nA pure sensory variant of GBS has been described in the literature. It is typified by a rapid onset of sensory loss, sensory ataxia, and areflexia in a symmetrical and widespread pattern. Lumbar puncture studies show albuminocytologic dissociation in the CSF, and results from electromyography (EMG) show characteristic signs of a demyelinating process in the peripheral nerves.\nThe prognosis in pure GBS is generally good. Immunotherapies, such as plasma exchange and the administration of IVIGs, can be tried in patients with severe disease or slow recovery.\n\nOther variants\nThe pharyngeal-cervical-brachial variant of GBS is distinguished by isolated facial, oropharyngeal, cervical, and upper limb weakness without lower limb involvement. There can be combinations of any of the above subtypes, and virtually any combination of nerve injury. There are likely mild cases that cause temporary symptoms, improve spontaneously, and never get definitively diagnosed.\nOther unusual clinical variants with restricted patterns of weakness are observed only in rare cases.\n\nEtiology:\nGBS is considered to be a postinfectious, immune-mediated disease targeting peripheral nerves. Up to two thirds of patients report an antecedent bacterial or viral illness prior to the onset of neurologic symptoms.Respiratory infections are most frequently reported, followed by gastrointestinal infections. Administration of certain vaccinations and other systemic illnesses have also been associated with GBS. Case reports exist regarding numerous medications and procedures; however, whether any causal link exists is unclear.\nC jejuni:\nIn several studies, C jejuni was the most commonly isolated pathogen in GBS. Serology studies in a Dutch GBS trial identified 32% of patients as having had a recent C jejuni infection, while studies in northern China documented infection rates as high as 60%. \nGastrointestinal and upper respiratory tract symptoms can be observed with C jejuni infections. C jejuni infections can also have a subclinical course, resulting in patients with no reported infectious symptoms prior to the development of GBS. Patients who develop GBS following an antecedent C jejuni infection often have a more severe course, with rapid progression and a prolonged, incomplete recovery. A strong clinical association has been noted between C jejuni infections and the pure motor and axonal forms of GBS.\nThe virulence of C jejuni is thought to result from the presence of specific antigens in its capsule that are shared with nerves. Immune responses directed against capsular lipopolysaccharides produce antibodies that cross-react with myelin to cause demyelination. C jejuni infections also generate anti-ganglioside antibodies\u2014including to the gangliosides GM1, GD1a, GalNac-GD1a, and GD1b\u2014that are commonly found in patients with AMAN and AMSAN, the axonal subtypes of GBS. (Patients with C. jejuni enteritis not complicated by GBS, however, do not produce the specific anti-ganglioside antibodies.)\nEven in the subgroup of patients with GM1 antibodies, however, the clinical manifestations vary. Host susceptibility is probably one determinant in the development of GBS after infectious illness. \nAlthough GM1 antibodies can also be found in patients with demyelinating GBS, they are much less common in these cases. C. jejuni infection can also generate antibodies to the ganglioside GQ1b, a component of oculomotor nerve myelin; these are associated with MFS.\nCOVID-19:\nEvidence exists that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is linked to the development of neurologic complications, including GBS. By April 20, 2020, one case of GBS in a patient with COVID-19 had been reported out of China and five such cases had been reported out of Italy. A report on the Italian cases said that GBS developed 5-10 days after COVID-19 had been diagnosed, with three of the patients having the demyelinating form of GBS, and the other two appearing to have an axonal variant. \nIn June 2020, the first US case report of a patient with GBS associated with COVID-19 was published. The syndrome developed soon after the individual became infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, with test results indicating that he had the demyelinating form of GBS.\n\nEpidemiology:\nGBS is a rare disease with an incidence of 0.81\u20131.89 (median 1.11) per 100,000 person\u2013years, and is more common in men than in women (ratio 3:2).1,16 Worldwide, the incidence is variable; for example, a low rate of 0.40 per 100,000 person\u2013years was reported in Brazil, in contrast to a high rate of 2.5 per 100,000 person\u2013years in Cura\u00e7ao and Bangladesh.16\u201320 GBS seems to occur less frequently in children (0.34\u20131.34 per 100,000 person-years) than in adults, 18 and its incidence increases with age 16.18.\nFigure 1 | The course of GBS. The majority of patients with GBS report an infection before the onset of weakness. Antiganglioside antibodies are often detected; their levels decrease over time. Different types of antibodies are related to the preceding infection and the GBS subtype. Progressive weakness reaches its maximum within 4 weeks (often within 2 weeks). The recovery phase may last many weeks, months or even years. Abbreviation: GBS, Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Reprinted from Lancet Neurology 7, van Doorn, P. A., Ruts, L. & Jacobs, B. C. Clinical features, pathogenesis, and treatment of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, 939\u2013950 \u00a9 (2008), with permission from Elsevier.\n\nThe background incidence of GBS in most studies remains constant over time, although seasonal fluctuations have occasionally been found in studies from Cura\u00e7ao, Bangladesh and China. The proportions of patients with GBS who have AIDP and AMAN vary greatly around the world. AIDP is the predominant subtype (60\u201380% of patients) in North America and Europe. By contrast, the frequency of AMAN ranges from 6\u20137% in the UK and Spain to 30\u201365% in Asia, Central America and South America. The geographical diversity is probably attributable to differences in exposure to certain types of infection, possibly in combination with different genetic susceptibilities due to varying genetic polymorphisms between individuals or groups of people living in different areas of the world. These differences may be related not only to the development of a specific GBS subtype, but also to the course and severity of disease. Genetic studies with a high number of patients are required to investigate these relationships.\n\nThe background incidence of GBS in most studies remains constant over time, although seasonal fluctuations have occasionally been found in studies from Cura\u00e7ao, Bangladesh and China.

These differences may be related not only to the development of a specific GBS subtype, but also to the course and severity of disease. Genetic studies with a high number of patients are required to investigate these relationships.\n\nPathogenesis:\nAs indicated above, GBS is a postinfectious disorder. Two-thirds of patients report symptoms of a respiratory or gastrointestinal tract infection before the onset of GBS. In about half of patients with GBS, a specific type of preceding infection can be identified, and C. jejuni is responsible for at least one-third of these infections. Other pathogens that cause antecedent infections related to GBS are cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013 Barr virus, Mycoplasma pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae, and influenza A virus. Notably, a case\u2013control study conducted in the Netherlands showed that 5% of patients with GBS had a hepatitis E virus infection before onset of GBS, compared with 0.5% of matched healthy controls. Similarly, 10% of patients with GBS from Bangladesh had an antecedent hepatitis E virus infection, indicating that hepatitis E virus is a worldwide trigger of GBS.30 However, despite the strong association between specific acute infections and GBS, the overall risk of developing this severe postinfectious complication is very small. Only one in 1,000\u20135,000 patients with Campylobacter enteritis will develop GBS in the subsequent 2 months.This fact explains why GBS is a sporadic disorder, although outbreaks of GBS after C. jejuni infection have occasionally been reported. One of the critical steps in GBS pathogenesis after C. jejuni infection is the generation of antibodies that crossreact with specific gangliosides (Figure 2), which are not produced during uncomplicated C. jejuni gastroenteritis. However, the production of crossreactive antibodies is only induced in susceptible individuals. Antibodies that crossreact with various gangliosides have been described in patients with GBS. However, only a subset of C. jejuni strains contain lipo-oligosaccharides that mimic the carbohydrate moiety of gangliosides that are present in human peripheral nerves (Figure 2). The synthesis of these ganglioside-mimicking carbohydrate structures depends on a set of polymorphic genes and enzymes that vary greatly between different C. jejuni strains. The Thr51 variant of the C. jejunicstII gene is associated with the occurrence of GBS, while the Asn51 variant is associated with MFS. Some antibody specificities are associated with particular GBS subtypes and related neurological deficits, reflecting the distribution of different gangliosides in human peripheral nerves (Table 1). C. jejuni infections are predominantly, but not exclusively, related to the AMAN or pure motor subtype of GBS. Patients with AMAN frequently have serum antibodies against GM1a, GM1b, GD1a and GalNAc-GD1a gangliosides. Patients with MFS or MFS\u2013GBS overlap syndrome (see below) frequently have antibodies against GD1b, GD3, GT1a and GQ1b gangliosides, which are related to ataxia and ophthalmoplegia. In a study from the Netherlands, 20% of patients with AIDP related to cytomegalovirus infection had anti-GM2 antibodies, although these antibodies are also found in patients with uncomplicated cytomegalovirus infections. Interestingly, as well as antibodies against single ganglio sides, patients can also have antibodies against combinations of epitopes from ganglioside complexes. Such complexes are located in specialized microdomains, or \u2018lipid rafts\u2019, in the cell membrane. Antibodies that target ganglioside complexes also crossreact with C. jejuni lipo-oligosaccharides, and are probably induced by a preceding infection with C. jejuni. Antibodies against various combinations or complexes of glycolipids have also been reported in patients with AIDP, although the role of these antibodies in its pathogenesis remains to be determined.  \nFigure 2 | Immunopathogenesis of GBS: molecular mimicry and antiganglioside antibodies. Infections with pathogens, such as Campylobacter jejuni, can trigger humoral immune and autoimmune responses that result in nerve dysfunction and the symptoms of GBS. Lipo-oligosaccharides on the C. jejuni outer membrane may elicit the production of antibodies that crossreact with gangliosides, such as GM1 and GD1a on peripheral nerves. The antigens targeted in AMAN are located at or near the node of Ranvier. The anti-GM1 and anti-GD1a antibodies bind to the nodal axolemma, leading to complement activation followed by MAC formation and disappearance of voltage-gated sodium channels. This damage can lead to detachment of paranodal myelin, and nerve conduction failure. Macrophages then invade from the nodes into the periaxonal space, scavenging the injured axons. The antigens targeted in AIDP are, presumably, located on the myelin sheath. The antibodies can activate complement, which leads to formation of the MAC on the outer surface of Schwann cells, initiation of vesicular degeneration, and invasion of myelin by macrophages. Abbreviations: AIDP, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy; AMAN, acute motor axonal neuropathy; APC, antigen-presenting cell; GBS, Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome; MAC, membrane attack complex.\n\nIn conjunction with the presence of antiganglioside antibodies, complement activation seems to contribute to nerve degeneration in GBS\u2014a phenomenon that has been studied at the nodes of Ranvier and at the motor nerve terminal in a mouse model of AMAN. Sodium channel clusters, as well as paranodal axoglial junctions, the nodal cytoskeleton, and Schwann cell microvilli, all of which stabilize the sodium channel clusters, were disrupted by complement activation in a GBS disease model. Additional studies in a GBS mouse model provided evidence that blockade of complement activation prevents emergence of the clinical signs of antiganglioside-mediated neuropathy.61 The development of GBS after a C. jejuni infection may also depend on patient-related factors that influence the susceptibility to produce crossreactive, carbohydratetargeted antibodies. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that GBS has a relapse rate of 5%, which is clearly higher than would be expected by chance. The initial pathogen\u2013host interaction has a key role in the development of GBS. C. jejuni lipo-oligosaccharides bind to siglec-7 (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 7) and activate dendritic cells via Toll-like receptor 4 and CD14. These dendritic cells produce type 1 interferon and tumour necrosis factor (TNF), which induce proliferation of B cells. This immune activation could be influenced by genetic polymorphisms but, to date, genetic factors have only been studied in small cohorts of patients. Interestingly, a meta-analysis identified a moderate association between GBS and a particular TNF polymorphism. In addition, an association between polymorphisms in the MBL2 gene (encoding mannose-binding protein C) and the severity and outcome of GBS has been confirmed. Future genome wide association studies in large, well-described and adequately controlled cohorts are required to establish the role of host factors in the pathogenesis of GBS.\n\nThe potential role of vaccination:\nA few patients develop GBS shortly after receiving a vaccination. Despite their rarity, such events cause con siderable public concern. In the vaccination campaign against influenza A (H1N1) in the USA in 1976, the estimated attributable risk of vaccine-related GBS was about one in 100,000.66 A similar association was suggested for the vaccination campaign against influenza A (H1N1) in 2009, but extensive national and international studies found that vaccination was associated with only a small attributable risk of GBS: 1.6 excess cases of GBS per 1,000,000 vaccine recipients, a frequency similar to that for all seasonal vaccinations. In fact, vaccination might even reduce the risk of acquiring GBS, as this condition can be caused by infections such as influenza. The risk of developing GBS after influenza infection is estimated to be 4\u20137 times higher than after influenza vaccination. No relapses of GBS in patients with a history of this disease have been observed after influenza vaccination. For these reasons, the following practical guideline regarding vaccination of patients with a history of GBS is currently used in the Netherlands: GBS as such is not an indication for influenza vaccination, and vaccination seems to be safe in patients who developed GBS >3 months ago and when onset of GBS was not shortly after vaccination.\n\nDiagnosis:\nDiagnostic criteria:\nIn 1978, the US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) developed case definitions for GBS in the course of investigating the suspected association between GBS and the swine flu vaccination campaign of 1976\u20131977. The initial diagnostic criteria published in 1981 were modified in 1990. Though primarily developed for research purposes, they are probably still the most widely used criteria in clinical practice.4 The criteria consist of features that are required for or strongly support the diagnosis of GBS, and features that cast doubt on the diagnosis (Box 1). In 2011, the Brighton Collaboration published new case definitions for GBS while studying a possible association between GBS and the H1N1 swine flu vaccination campaign of 2009\u20132010. These criteria were specifically developed for retrospective epidemiological and vaccine safety studies and, consequently, are likely to combine high specificity with limited sensitivity. The Brighton criteria identify GBS with four levels of diagnostic certainty, from level 1 (highest) to level 4 (lowest). Use of the Brighton criteria to classify patients with suspected GBS is highly dependent on completeness of the diagnostic data. A study from the Netherlands in 335 patients with GBS with complete sets of diagnostic data\u2014which are required for level 1 certainty according to the Brighton criteria\u2014classified 61% as level 1, 33% as level 2, none as level 3 and 6% as level 4. However, patients diagnosed at different levels of diagnostic certainty did not differ in disease severity or outcome. In studies from Korea and India in patients who had GBS, 24% and 14% of patients, respectively, were classified as level 4. The Brighton criteria are not, however, intended to be used for diagnostic purposes in clinical practice. Further research is needed to develop criteria that can be used to diagnose GBS and its less-frequent variants in the acute phase of the disease. However, in practice, the criteria published in 1990 still provide a good basis for clinicians worldwide to make a diagnosis of GBS.\n\nTreatment:\nTreatment of GBS usually combines multidisciplinary supportive medical care and immunotherapy. Proven effective treatments for GBS are IVIg and plasma exchange. Immunotherapy is usually started if patients are not able to walk 10 m unaided (GBS Disability Scale score \u22653). Plasma exchange and IVIg have pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects, but we have yet to establish which effects explain their therapeutic efficacy in GBS, and whether the same effects are involved in all patients and all subtypes of GBS. IVIg treatment may inhibit Fc-mediated activation of immune cells, binding of antiganglioside antibodies to their neural targets or local complement activation. Serum IgG Fc glycosylation in patients with GBS seems to be associated with disease severity and could influence the immunomodulatory effects of IVIg. Plasma exchange is thought to remove neurotoxic antibodies, complement factors and other humoral mediators of inflammation. Plasma exchange is beneficial when performed within the first 4 weeks after onset of weakness in patients who are unable to walk unaided (GBS Disability Scale score \u22653), but the largest effect is seen when treatment is started within the first 2 weeks. The usual plasma exchange regimen consists of five treatments administered over 2 weeks, involving a total of about five plasma volumes. In mildly affected patients (still able to walk), however, two plasma exchange sessions induced more-rapid onset of motor recovery than did no plasma exchange. IVIg is effective in patients who are unable to walk 10 m unaided (GBS Disability Scale score \u22653) and when started within 2 weeks of onset of weakness. Randomized controlled trials showed that IVIg at a dose of 0.4 g/kg daily for 5 consecutive days (or 1 g/kg daily for 2 days) was as effective as a full course of five plasma exchange sessions applied over 2 weeks. Whether rapid IVIg treatment over 2 days is superior to treatment with the same total dose (2 g/kg) administered over 5 days has not been fully evaluated. However, one trial demonstrated that children receiving treatment over 2 days more frequently had treatment-related fluctuations than did children receiving treatment over 5 days. As IVIg therapy is widely available, does not require special equipment, and generally has only minor adverse effects, it has replaced plasma exchange as the preferred treatment for GBS in many hospitals. Immunoabsorption, as an alternative to plasma exchange, is occasionally used as a treatment for patients with GBS, and may be equally effective. However, no large-scale randomized controlled trials have shown that treatments other than IVIg or plasma exchange are effective. The choice of treatment depends on both patientrelated and socioeconomic factors. For instance, plasma exchange requires special equipment and is not always available in all hospitals. In addition, plasma exchange can be difficult to perform in young children, and care should be taken in patients with autonomic cardiovascular instability because of the large volume shifts involved in the plasma exchange procedure. However, the direct costs of IVIg treatment can be more than twice those of plasma exchange, making this treatment less attractive in low-income countries. In this respect, it is important to remember that most clinical trials of these treatments were conducted in Western Europe or North America and, therefore, predominantly involved patients who fulfilled the most commonly used GBS diagnostic criteria.4 The results of these trials might be less applicable in other parts of the world, especially where AMAN is highly prevalent. Whether patients with AMAN should receive the same treatment as those with AIDP remains uncertain. Results from a small study, which unfortunately had some methodological flaws, suggested that patients with AMAN might have better outcomes after treatment with plasma exchange than after IVIg therapy, and that plasma exchange was also the most cost-effective option. However, in countries where plasma exchange machines are not widely available or patients cannot afford this expensive procedure, small-volume plasma exchange or exchange transfusion can be a low-cost therapeutic option. Controlled studies of these procedures are currently lacking. The combination of plasma exchange followed by IVIg is not significantly better than either plasma exchange or IVIg alone. Oral steroids and intravenous methylprednisolone are not beneficial in patients with GBS. The combination of IVIg and methylprednisolone is no more effective than IVIg alone, although this combined treatment might have some additional short-term benefits when known prognostic factors are taken into account. Small randomized placebo-controlled trials of IFN-\u03b21a and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and one trial studying a 6 week course of mycophenolate mofetil combined with standard IVIg versus IVIg alone, did not indicate beneficial effects of these treatments. No randomized controlled trials have been performed in patients with MFS.126 A retrospective analysis showed that recovery starts slightly earlier in patients with MFS treated with IVIg than in those who were treated with plasma exchange or received no immunotherapy. However, final outcomes were the same in all three groups. Indeed, almost all patients with MFS recover fully, irrespective of whether they receive immunotherapy. Owing to the lack of evidence of a beneficial effect of IVIg or plasma exchange in patients with MFS, combined with the good natural recovery seen in these patients, withholding of immunotherapy in patients with MFS seems currently justified. However, patients with MFS\u2013GBS overlap syndrome can be severely affected, and treatment with IVIg or plasma exchange remains an option for these patients. Notably, no large-scale randomized controlled trials have been performed to determine the optimal treatment strategy in children with GBS and they are, therefore, usually treated in the same manner as adults with GBS.\n\nOngoing research:\nNearly a century after it was first described, GBS is still a life-threatening disorder that results in a poor outcome in at least 20% of patients and has persistent residual effects in the majority. Further research is urgently required to improve this situation. From a clinical perspective, the following are the most challenging needs: to develop improved diagnostic criteria for use in daily clinical practice, trials and vaccine safety studies; to determine the burden of disease caused by GBS worldwide; to develop new and better GBS outcome measures; to establish the precipitating events and patient-related factors that lead to GBS; to define biological and clinical predictors of the clinical course and outcome in individual patients; and, most importantly, to develop moreeffective and specific treatments, as well as protocols for supportive care. These aims can probably only be achieved by largescale international and multidisciplinary collaborations, such as the International GBS Outcome Study (IGOS), which was launched in 2012. Tissue samples and detailed, standardized clinical data are being collected during a follow-up period of 1\u20133 years with the intention of including at least 1,000 patients with GBS from all over the world. At present, centres from 17 countries\u2014 Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, Spain, South Africa, Taiwan, UK and the USA\u2014are recruiting patients. In addition, a randomized controlled trial, the SID-GBS study, is being conducted in the Netherlands. This trial is investigating the effect of a second course of IVIg given shortly after the first course in patients with GBS who have a poor prognosis (defined as a mEGOS score of 6\u201312 at 1 week after initiation of a standard 5 day course of IVIg). A related international study with an observational prospective design (I-SID-GBS) is investigating the same approach. This study is part of IGOS and is being performed by the Inflammatory Neuropathy Consortium. In addition, a new randomized placebo-controlled trial of eculizumab in patients with early GBS who are unable to walk is about to start. This study is partly based on findings in an animal model of GBS, in which antiganglioside antibodies induce complementdependent damage at the nodes of Ranvier, nerve terminals, and perisynaptic Schwann cells (Figure 2). Notably, these deleterious effects of complement on nerve terminals in mice can be blocked by the administration of eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to complement factor C5 and prevents its cleavage to C5a and the proinflammatory, cytolytic C5b-9 complex.61 Many other studies, such as those investigating pain treatment, nerve regeneration, and other factors that may improve the outcomes of patients with GBS, are eagerly awaited.\n\nLitrature Review:\nThe understanding of the disease mechanism of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome has evolved in recent years. Development of new treatments has been limited since immunotherapy was introduced in the 1980s and 1990s. An animal model (experimental autoimmune neuritis in rats) is often used for studies, and some agents have shown promise: glatiramer acetate, quinupramine, fasudil (an inhibitor of the Rhokinase enzyme) and the heart drug flecainide. An antibody targeted against the anti-GD3 antiganglioside antibody has shown benefit in laboratory research. Given the role of the complement system in GBS, it has been suggested that complement inhibitors (such as the drug eculizumab) may be effective \nSara Morsy et.al (2020) : The study suggests that NCAM may play a significant role in the immunopathogenesis of GBS. NCAM antibodies can be used as a marker for Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. However, more experimental studies are needed to prove these results. This study aimed at identifying human neural proteins that can be attacked by cross-reacting SARS-COV-2 antibodies causing Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. These markers can be used for the diagnosis of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS). To achieve this goal, proteins implicated in the development of GBS were retrieved from literature. These human proteins were compared to SARS-COV-2 surface proteins to identify homologous sequences using Blastp. Then, MHC-I and MHC-II epitopes were determined in the homologous sequences and used for further analysis. Similar human and SARS-COV-2 epitopes were docked to the corresponding MHC molecule to compare the binding pattern of human and SARS-COV-2 proteins to the MHC molecule. \nBadshah et al (2019) : The Zika virus (ZIKV) has gained attention for the last few years due to the congenital microcephaly and Guillain\u2013Barre Syndrome that resulted in humans. The non-structural protein (NS3) helicase of ZIKV play an important role in viral RNA replication. In this article, the researchers performed hundred nanosecond molecular dynamics simulation and molecular docking of the NS3 helicase of ZIKV with 1,4-benzothiazine derivatives. \nPier Paolo Sainaghi et al (2010) : Patients and methods: CSF samples were collected during a diagnostic lumbar puncture and stored at 30 C.Weanalyzed the CSF of nine subjects with GBS; eight with CIDP; eight with diabetic polyneuropathy (DP) and seven with headache (controls). Fifty inflammatory mediators were simultaneously measured with a multiplex bead-based ELISA on a Suspension Array System. After Bonferroni\u2019s correction for repeated measures, non-parametric variance and post hoc test were calculated. Results: Thirty-two inflammatory mediators were expressed. The median concentration of IL-6, IL-9, IL15, IL-18, CCL4, CXCL1, LIF, MIF, PDGFbb, IFN-c2, IL-2ra, IL-12(p40), IL-16, SCGF-b, TRAIL, FGF, G-CSF, GMCSF, and M-CSF was not different among groups (variance: n.s.). The median concentration of CCL2, CCL7, CCL27, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL12, ICAM1, VCAM1 and VEGF was higher in CIDP and GBS compared with controls (p < 0.002). The median concentration of IL-8 and IL-1ra was higher in GBS than CIDP or DP or controls, whereas stem cell factor (SCF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) were higher in CIDP than GBS or DP or controls (p < 0.002). \nMichiaki Koga et al (2023) Objective : To investigate the frequency of serum autoantibodies targeting contactin-associated protein 1 (Caspr1) and its complexes with other paranode antigens, contactin-1 (CNTN1) and neurofascin 155 (NF155), in Japanese patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). \nResults :Anti-Caspr1 antibodies were present in one participant (case 1, 3.8%) of CIDP, and negative in all Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome patients and healthy participant. The detected anti-Caspr1 antibodies predominantly belonged to the immunoglobulin\u2009G4 subclass, and the addition of CNTN1 to Caspr1 as an antigen increased antibody reactivity, although the increase was just 20\u201330% at most. The presence of autoantibodies against paranode protein complexes, including Caspr1/CNTN1, Caspr1/NF155 and Caspr1/CNTN1/NF155, was confirmed in several CIDP patients, although they also had anti-Caspr1 or anti-NF155 antibodies; thus, in our cohort, there were no patients with autoantibodies that specifically recognized paranode protein complexes. \nJ\u00b4 er \u02c6ome J. Devaux , Masaaki Odaka , and Nobuhiro Yuki (2012) Neurofascin-186 (NF186), neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NrCAM), and gliomedin are adhesion molecules playing a central role in the formation of nodes of Ranvier. In Guillain-Barr\u00b4 e syndrome (GBS), immune attack toward the nodes may participate in the disabilities. Autoantibodies to NF186 and gliomedin have been detected in a rat model of GBS. Here, researcher investigated the prevalence of antibodies against nodal adhesion molecules in patients with GBS or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). \nMingyun Shen et al (2013) : Rho kinases (ROCK1 and ROCK2) belong to serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) protein kinase family, and play the central roles in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Therefore, Rho kinases have become attractive targets for the treatments of many diseases, such as cancer, renal disease, hypertension, ischemia, and stroke. In order to develop small-molecule inhibitors of ROCK1, molecular docking was utilized to virtually screen two chemical databases and identify molecules that interact with ROCK1. \nMarc\u2019s Jacobs et.al (2005): The ROCK protein consists of several domains: an N-terminal region, a kinase catalytic domain, a coiled-coil domain containing a RhoA binding site, and a pleckstrin homology domain. The Cterminal region of ROCK binds to and inhibits the kinase catalytic domains, and this inhibition is reversed by binding RhoA, a small GTPase. This report present the structure of the N-terminal region and the kinase domain. In given protein two N-terminal regions interact to form a dimerization domain linking two kinase domains together. This spatial arrangement presents the kinase active sites and regulatory sequences on a common face affording the possibility of both kinases simultaneously interacting with a dimeric inhibitory domain or with a dimeric substrate. The kinase domain adopts a catalytically competent conformation; however, no phosphorylation of active site residues is observed in the structure. They also determined the structures of ROCK bound to four different ATP competitive small molecule inhibitors (Y-27632, fasudil , hydroxyfasudil, and H-1152P)\n\nMolecular Docking:\nMolecular Docking is performed in four important steps \u2013\n1)\tProtein preparation\n2)\tLigand preparation\n3)\tReceptor grid generation\n4)\tMolecular docking (Ligand docking)\n\nProtein Preparation: \nPreparing a protein for molecular docking, especially for rho kinase (ROCK), involves a meticulous series of steps aimed at ensuring its structural integrity and suitability for computational analysis. Firstly, the crystal structure of rho kinase is retrieved from a reliable protein structure database like the Protein Data Bank (PDB), ensuring high resolution and relevant ligands or co-factors if needed. Subsequently, the protein structure undergoes thorough preparation, which includes removing water molecules, heteroatoms, and any extraneous entities not pertinent to the docking study. Any structural irregularities or missing residues are corrected, and any hydrogen atoms missing from the structure are added. Energy minimization is then performed to alleviate steric clashes and optimize the protein's conformation for docking, utilizing molecular\n modeling software such as GROMACS, CHARMM, or Schr\u00f6dinger suite, along with an appropriate force field. Ligands intended for docking undergo a similar preparation process, including removal of water molecules and energy minimization to attain stable conformations. The next step involves defining a docking grid around the active site of rho kinase, crucial for guiding the docking software in predicting accurate ligand binding poses. Molecular docking is then executed using specialized software such as AutoDock, AutoDock Vina, or GOLD, docking the prepared ligands into the active site and assessing the binding affinities of resultant complexes. Following docking, thorough analysis and visualization of results are conducted to identify potential ligand-protein interactions and select promising ligand poses, facilitated by molecular visualization tools like PyMOL or VMD. Validation of docking results through experimental assays, such as enzyme inhibition assays or biochemical assays, is imperative to confirm predicted binding interactions. Further optimization may be pursued based on docking results and experimental validation, including refining ligands or conducting additional rounds of docking with modified ligands to enhance binding affinities and selectivity. Finally, meticulous documentation of all steps undertaken during protein preparation and docking is essential for reproducibility and dissemination of findings to the scientific community through publications or presentations. \n\nFig: Rho Kinase\n\nLigand Preparation:\nIn the realm of molecular docking studies, the preparation of ligands stands as a pivotal phase, ensuring their readiness for accurate binding within the protein's active site. A comprehensive approach to ligand preparation entails several systematic steps. Initially, the 2D or 3D structure of the ligand of interest is acquired from reputable chemical databases like PubChem, ChEMBL, or ZINC, with utmost attention to ensuring compatibility with molecular modeling software. Following this, the ligand structure undergoes rigorous standardization, where potential errors such as missing atoms or bonds, incorrect valence, or inconsistent bond orders are meticulously addressed using sophisticated chemical structure editing tools such as Open Babel or RDKit. Subsequently, the determination of the ligand's protonation state at physiological pH, often around pH 7.4, is crucial. This task is accomplished using tools like MarvinSketch, Epik (Schr\u00f6dinger suite), or online platforms like PROPKA. Energy minimization then ensues, aiming to optimize the ligand's geometry and eliminate steric clashes through the employment of molecular modeling software such as RDKit, Avogadro, or Schr\u00f6dinger suite. The exploration of potential bioactive conformations involves the generation of tautomers and stereoisomers of the ligand, facilitated by advanced software tools like OpenEye Omega or Schr\u00f6dinger's LigPrep. Additionally, the ligand's flexibility and binding modes are further scrutinized through the generation of multiple conformations using techniques such as molecular dynamics simulations or conformational sampling algorithms available in software tools like RDKit or OMEGA. The consideration of solvation effects is pivotal in accurate docking calculations, prompting the removal of explicit water molecules from the ligand's structure. Subsequent to the preparation steps, the ligand structure undergoes conversion into formats compatible with molecular docking software such as PDBQT, MOL2, or SDF. Validation of the prepared ligands is then conducted by comparing them with known bioactive conformations or experimental data, where available, to ensure reliability. Finally, meticulous documentation of all ligand preparation steps, inclusive of software tools used and parameters applied, is imperative for fostering reproducibility and facilitating the dissemination of findings within the scientific community. By adhering to this comprehensive approach, ligands are meticulously primed for molecular docking studies, thereby augmenting the accuracy and reliability of ensuing docking results.\n\n\n\n\nLigand Used:\nKaempferol \nIUPAC Name: 3,4\u2032,5,7-Tetrahydroxyflavone \n\nChemical Formula\tC15H10O6\nMolar Mass\t286.23 g/mol\nDensity\t1.688 g/mol\nMelting Point\t276-278 \u2103\n\nNatural Occurrence: \nKaempferol is a secondary metabolite found in many plants, plant-derived foods, and traditional medicines.\u202fIts flavor is considered bitter. \nIn Plants and Food: \nKaempferol is common in \u202fPteridophyta, Pinophyta, and \u202fAngiospermae.

Although fasudil itself is not found in nature, the physiological pathways it influences are intrinsic to human biology.\n\nReceptor grid generation:\nReceptor grid generation stands as a pivotal stage in molecular docking studies, delineating the search space within the protein where ligands will engage in binding interactions. This critical process encompasses several meticulous steps to ensure the accuracy and reliability of subsequent docking calculations. Initially, the active site or binding pocket within the protein is meticulously identified, drawing upon experimental data from crystal structures of protein-ligand complexes or employing computational methods like binding site prediction algorithms. Subsequently, the dimensions of the grid box enclosing the active site are precisely defined, striking a balance between accommodating potential ligand binding orientations and maintaining computational efficiency. Determining the spacing between grid points within the grid box follows suit, ensuring adequate sampling of space for ligand binding without unduly prolonging computational time. Utilizing dedicated molecular docking software, such as AutoDockTools for AutoDock or Schr\u00f6dinger's Glide for Glide, facilitates the generation of the receptor grid, incorporating tools specifically designed for this purpose. Centering the grid box coordinates around the active site ensures that ligands are docked within the pertinent region of the protein, optimizing docking accuracy. Visualizing the receptor grid using sophisticated visualization tools like PyMOL, VMD, or UCSF Chimera ensures its adequate coverage of the active site and the space where ligands are anticipated to bind. Validation of the generated receptor grid is imperative, necessitating comparison with experimental data or known binding poses of ligands to ascertain its fidelity in representing the binding site and facilitating accurate docking calculations. Comprehensive documentation of the parameters employed for receptor grid generation, encompassing grid dimensions, spacing, and center coordinates, underpins reproducibility and facilitates the dissemination of findings within the scientific community. By meticulously adhering to these steps, a receptor grid conducive to molecular docking studies is generated, enabling the precise prediction of ligand binding poses and affinities within the protein's active site.\n\nMolecular docking (Ligand docking):\nLigand docking \nDocking protocol validation:\nValidating a docking protocol for Rho kinase (ROCK) involves compiling a diverse ligand dataset, preparing the protein structure, and selecting appropriate docking software.

Weakness and tingling in your hands and feet are usually the first symptoms.\nThese sensations can quickly spread, eventually paralyzing your whole body. In its most severe form Guillain-Barre syndrome is a medical emergency. Most people with the condition must be hospitalized to receive treatment.\nSymptoms: Guillain-Barre syndrome often begins with tingling and weakness starting in your feet and legs and spreading to your upper body and arms. Some people notice the first symptoms in the arms or face. As Guillain-Barre syndrome progresses, muscle weakness can turn into paralysis.\nSigns and symptoms of Guillain-Barre syndrome may include:\n\u2022 A pins and needles sensation in your fingers, toes, ankles or wrists\n\u2022 Weakness in your legs that spreads to your upper body\n\u2022 Unsteady walking or inability to walk or climb stairs\n\u2022 Difficulty with facial movements, including speaking, chewing or swallowing\n\u2022 Double vision or inability to move the eyes\n\u2022 Severe pain that may feel achy, shooting or cramplike and may be worse at night\n\u2022 Difficulty with bladder control or bowel function\n\u2022 Rapid heart rate\n\u2022 Low or high blood pressure\n\u2022 Difficulty breathing\nPeople with Guillain-Barre syndrome usually experience their most significant weakness within two weeks after symptoms begin.\nRisk factors: Guillain-Barre syndrome can affect all age groups, but your risk increases as you age. It\u2019s also slightly more common in males than females.\nGuillain-Barre syndrome may be triggered by:\n\u2022 Most commonly, infection with campylobacter, a type of bacteria often found in undercooked poultry\n\u2022 Influenza virus\n\u2022 Cytomegalovirus\n\u2022 Epstein-Barr virus\n\u2022 Zika virus\n\u2022 Hepatitis A, B, C and E\n\u2022 HIV, the virus that causes AIDS\n\u2022 Mycoplasma pneumonia\n\u2022 Surgery\n\u2022 Trauma\n\u2022 Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma\n\u2022 Rarely, influenza vaccinations or childhood vaccinations\n\u2022 COVID-19 virus\n\u2022 COVID-19 Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccine.\nComplications:\nGuillain-Barre syndrome affects your nerves. Because nerves control your movements and body functions, people with Guillain-Barre may experience:\nBreathing difficulties: The weakness or paralysis can spread to the muscles that control your breathing, a potentially fatal complication. Up to 22% of people with Guillain-Barre syndrome need temporary help from a machine to breathe within the first week when they\u2019re hospitalized for treatment.\nResidual numbness or other sensations: Most people with Guillain-Barre syndrome recover completely or have only minor, residual weakness, numbness or tingling.\nHeart and blood pressure problems: Blood pressure fluctuations and irregular heart rhythms (cardiac arrhythmias) are common side effects of Guillain-Barre syndrome.\nPain: One-third of people with Guillain-Barre syndrome experience severe nerve pain, which may be eased with medication.\nBowel and bladder function problems: Sluggish bowel function and urine retention may result from Guillain-Barre syndrome.\nBlood clots: People who are immobile due to Guillain-Barre syndrome are at risk of developing blood clots. Until you\u2019re able to walk independently, taking blood thinners and wearing support stockings may be recommended.\nPressure sores: Being immobile also puts you at risk of developing bedsores (pressure sores). Frequent repositioning may help avoid this problem.\nRelapse: A small percentage of people with Guillain-Barre syndrome have a relapse, experiencing muscle weakness even years after the symptoms ended.\nLocal (normal) Treatment:\nThere\u2019s no cure for Guillain-Barre syndrome. But two types of treatments can speed recovery and reduce the severity of the illness:\nPlasma exchange (plasmapheresis): The liquid portion of part of your blood (plasma) is removed and separated from your blood cells. The blood cells are then put back into your body, which manufactures more plasma to make up for what was removed. Plasmapheresis may work by ridding plasma of certain antibodies that contribute to the immune system\u2019s attack on the peripheral nerves.\nImmunoglobulin therapy: Immunoglobulin containing healthy antibodies from blood donors is given through a vein (intravenously). High doses of immunoglobulin can block the damaging antibodies that may contribute to Guillain-Barre syndrome. These treatments are equally effective. Mixing them or administering one after the other is no more effective than using either method alone.\n\nYou are also likely to be given medication to:\nRelieve pain, which can be severe\nPrevent blood clots, which can develop while you\u2019re immobile\nPeople with Guillain-Barre syndrome need physical help and therapy before and during recovery. Your care may include:\nMovement of your arms and legs by caregivers before recovery, to help keep your muscles flexible and strong.\nPhysical therapy during recovery to help you cope with fatigue and regain strength and proper movement.\nTraining with adaptive devices, such as a wheelchair or braces, to give you mobility and self-care skills.\nBackground:\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) can be described as a collection of clinical syndromes that manifests as an acute inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy with resultant weakness and diminished reflexes. With poliomyelitis under control in developed countries, GBS is now the most important cause of acute flaccid paralysis. (See Clinical Presentation.)\nAlthough the classic description of GBS is that of a demyelinating neuropathy with ascending weakness, many clinical variants have been well documented in the medical literature, and variants involving the cranial nerves or pure motor involvement and axonal injury are not uncommon. (See Pathophysiology.)\nAcute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) is the most widely recognized form of GBS in Western countries, but the variants known as acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), acute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN), and Miller-Fisher syndrome also are well recognized.\nBased on a clinical spectrum of symptoms and findings, it is widely believed that strictly defined subgroups of GBS exist. However, these subgroups are not easily distinguished.\nGBS remains a diagnosis made primarily through the assessment of clinical history and findings (see Clinical Presentation). Serum autoantibodies are not measured routinely in the workup of GBS, but results may be helpful in patients with a questionable diagnosis or a variant of GBS (see Workup).\nApproximately one third of patients require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), primarily because of respiratory failure. After medical stabilization, patients can be treated on a general medical/neurologic floor, but continued vigilance remains important in preventing respiratory, cardiovascular, and other medical complications. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or plasma exchange may hasten recovery. After discharge, outpatient physical therapy and occupational therapy may be beneficial in helping patients with GBS to regain their baseline functional status.\n\nHistorical background:\nIn 1859, Landry published a report on 10 patients with an ascending paralysis. Subsequently, in 1916, 3 French physicians (Guillain, Barr\u00e9, and Strohl) described 2 French soldiers with motor weakness, areflexia, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) albuminocytologic dissociation, and diminished deep tendon reflexes. The identified syndrome was later named Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Historically, GBS was a single disorder; however, current practice acknowledges several variant forms.\n\nPathophysiology:\nGBS is a postinfectious, immune-mediated disease. Cellular and humoral immune mechanisms probably play a role in its development. Most patients report an infectious illness in the weeks prior to the onset of GBS. Many of the identified infectious agents are thought to induce production of antibodies that cross-react with specific gangliosides and glycolipids, such as GM1 and GD1b, that are distributed throughout the myelin in the peripheral nervous system.\nThe pathophysiologic mechanism of an antecedent illness and of GBS can be typified by Campylobacter jejuni infections. The virulence of C jejuni is thought to be based on the presence of specific antigens in its capsule that are shared with nerves.\nImmune responses directed against lipopolysaccharide antigens in the capsule of C jejuni result in antibodies that cross-react with ganglioside GM1 in myelin, resulting in immunologic damage to the peripheral nervous system. This process has been termed molecular mimicry.\nPathologic findings in GBS include lymphocytic infiltration of spinal roots and peripheral nerves (cranial nerves may be involved as well), followed by macrophage-mediated, multifocal stripping of myelin. This phenomenon results in defects in the propagation of electrical nerve impulses, with eventual absence or profound delay in conduction, causing flaccid paralysis. Recovery is typically associated with remyelination.\nIn some patients with severe disease, a secondary consequence of the severe inflammation is axonal disruption and loss. A subgroup of patients may have a primary immune attack directly against nerve axons, with sparing of myelin. The clinical presentation in these patients is similar to that of the principal type.\nSubtypes of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome:\nSeveral variants of GBS are recognized. These disorders share similar patterns of evolution, symptom overlap, and probable immune-mediated pathogenesis. Recovery from them varies.\n\nAcute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy\nThe acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) subtype is the most commonly identified form in the United States. It is generally preceded by a bacterial or viral infection. Nearly 40% of patients with AIDP are seropositive for C jejuni. Lymphocytic infiltration and macrophage-mediated peripheral nerve demyelination is present. Symptoms generally resolve with remyelination.\n\nAcute motor axonal neuropathy\nThe acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) subtype is a purely motor disorder that is more prevalent in pediatric age groups.] AMAN is generally characterized by rapidly progressive symmetrical weakness and ensuing respiratory failure.\nNearly 70-75% of patients with AMAN are seropositive for Campylobacter, with the majority of cases of AMAN being associated with preceding C jejuni diarrhea. Patients typically have high titers of antibodies to gangliosides (ie, GM1, GD1a, GD1b). Inflammation of the spinal anterior roots may lead to disruption of the blood-CNS barrier. Biopsies show wallerianlike degeneration without significant lymphocytic inflammation.\nMany cases have been reported in rural areas of China, especially in children and young adults during the summer months. Pure axonal cases may occur more frequently outside of Europe and North America. AMAN cases may also be different from cases of axonal GBS described in the West.\nPrognosis is often quite favorable. Although recovery for many is rapid, severely disabled patients with AMAN may show improvement over a period of years.\nOne third of patients with AMAN may actually be hyperreflexic. Although the mechanism for this hyperreflexia is unclear, dysfunction of the inhibitory system via spinal interneurons may increase motor neuron excitability. Hyperreflexia is significantly associated with the presence of anti-GM1 antibodies.\n\nAcute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy\nAcute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN) is a severe acute illness differing from AMAN in that it also affects sensory nerves and roots. [17] Patients are typically adults. AMSAN often presents as rapid and severe motor and sensory dysfunction. Marked muscle wasting is characteristic, and recovery is poorer than it is from electrophysiologically similar cases of AMAN.\nAs with AMAN, AMSAN is often associated with preceding C jejuni diarrhea. Pathologic findings show severe axonal degeneration of motor and sensory nerve fibers with little demyelination.\n\nMiller-Fisher syndrome\nMiller-Fisher syndrome (MFS), which is observed in about 5% of all cases of GBS, classically presents as a triad of ataxia, areflexia, and ophthalmoplegia. Acute onset of external ophthalmoplegia is a cardinal feature. Ataxia tends to be out of proportion to the degree of sensory loss. Patients may also have mild limb weakness, ptosis, facial palsy, or bulbar palsy. Patients have reduced or absent sensory nerve action potentials and absent tibial H reflex.\nAnti-GQ1b antibodies are prominent in MFS, and have a relatively high specificity and sensitivity for the disease.Dense concentrations of GQ1b ganglioside are found in the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves, which may explain the relationship between anti-GQ1b antibodies and ophthalmoplegia. Patients with acute oropharyngeal palsy carry anti-GQ1b/GT1a IgG antibodies.Recovery generally occurs within 1-3 months.\n\n\nAcute panautonomic neuropathy\nAcute panautonomic neuropathy, the rarest GBS variant, involves the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Patients have severe postural hypotension, bowel and bladder retention, anhidrosis, decreased salivation and lacrimation, and pupillary abnormalities. Cardiovascular involvement is common, and dysrhythmias are a significant source of mortality. Significant motor or sensory involvement is lacking. Recovery is gradual and often incomplete.\n\nPure sensory GBS\nA pure sensory variant of GBS has been described in the literature. It is typified by a rapid onset of sensory loss, sensory ataxia, and areflexia in a symmetrical and widespread pattern. Lumbar puncture studies show albuminocytologic dissociation in the CSF, and results from electromyography (EMG) show characteristic signs of a demyelinating process in the peripheral nerves.\nThe prognosis in pure GBS is generally good. Immunotherapies, such as plasma exchange and the administration of IVIGs, can be tried in patients with severe disease or slow recovery.\n\nOther variants\nThe pharyngeal-cervical-brachial variant of GBS is distinguished by isolated facial, oropharyngeal, cervical, and upper limb weakness without lower limb involvement. There can be combinations of any of the above subtypes, and virtually any combination of nerve injury. There are likely mild cases that cause temporary symptoms, improve spontaneously, and never get definitively diagnosed.\nOther unusual clinical variants with restricted patterns of weakness are observed only in rare cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtiology:\nGBS is considered to be a postinfectious, immune-mediated disease targeting peripheral nerves. Up to two thirds of patients report an antecedent bacterial or viral illness prior to the onset of neurologic symptoms.Respiratory infections are most frequently reported, followed by gastrointestinal infections. Administration of certain vaccinations and other systemic illnesses have also been associated with GBS. Case reports exist regarding numerous medications and procedures; however, whether any causal link exists is unclear.\nC jejuni:\nIn several studies, C jejuni was the most commonly isolated pathogen in GBS. Serology studies in a Dutch GBS trial identified 32% of patients as having had a recent C jejuni infection, while studies in northern China documented infection rates as high as 60%. Gastrointestinal and upper respiratory tract symptoms can be observed with C jejuni infections. C jejuni infections can also have a subclinical course, resulting in patients with no reported infectious symptoms prior to the development of GBS. Patients who develop GBS following an antecedent C jejuni infection often have a more severe course, with rapid progression and a prolonged, incomplete recovery. A strong clinical association has been noted between C jejuni infections and the pure motor and axonal forms of GBS. The virulence of C jejuni is thought to result from the presence of specific antigens in its capsule that are shared with nerves. Immune responses directed against capsular lipopolysaccharides produce antibodies that cross-react with myelin to cause demyelination. C jejuni infections also generate anti-ganglioside antibodies\u2014including to the gangliosides GM1, GD1a, GalNac-GD1a, and GD1b\u2014that are commonly found in patients with AMAN and AMSAN, the axonal subtypes of GBS. (Patients with C. jejuni enteritis not complicated by GBS, however, do not produce the specific anti-ganglioside antibodies.) Even in the subgroup of patients with GM1 antibodies, however, the clinical manifestations vary. Host susceptibility is probably one determinant in the development of GBS after infectious illness. Although GM1 antibodies can also be found in patients with demyelinating GBS, they are much less common in these cases. C. jejuni infection can also generate antibodies to the ganglioside GQ1b, a component of oculomotor nerve myelin; these are associated with MFS.\n\n\nCOVID-19:\nEvidence exists that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is linked to the development of neurologic complications, including GBS. By April 20, 2020, one case of GBS in a patient with COVID-19 had been reported out of China and five such cases had been reported out of Italy. A report on the Italian cases said that GBS developed 5-10 days after COVID-19 had been diagnosed, with three of the patients having the demyelinating form of GBS, and the other two appearing to have an axonal variant. In June 2020, the first US case report of a patient with GBS associated with COVID-19 was published. The syndrome developed soon after the individual became infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, with test results indicating that he had the demyelinating form of GBS.\n\nEpidemiology:\nGBS is a rare disease with an incidence of 0.81\u20131.89 (median 1.11) per 100,000 person\u2013years, and is more common in men than in women (ratio 3:2).1,16 Worldwide, the\nincidence is variable; for example, a low rate of 0.40 per 100,000 person\u2013years was reported\nin Brazil, in contrast to a high rate of 2.5 per 100,000 person\u2013years in Cura\u00e7ao and\nBangladesh.16\u201320 GBS seems to occur less frequently in children (0.34\u20131.34 per 100,000 person-years) than in adults, 18 and its incidence increases with age 16.18.\nFigure 1 | The course of GBS. The majority of patients with GBS report an infection before the onset of weakness. Antiganglioside antibodies are often detected; their levels decrease over time. Different types of antibodies are related to the preceding infection and the GBS subtype. Progressive weakness reaches its maximum within 4 weeks (often within 2 weeks). The recovery phase may last many weeks, months or even years. Abbreviation: GBS, Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Reprinted from Lancet Neurology 7, van Doorn, P. A., Ruts, L. & Jacobs, B. C. Clinical features, pathogenesis, and treatment of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, 939\u2013950 \u00a9 (2008), with permission from Elsevier.\nThe background incidence of GBS in most studies remains constant over time, although seasonal fluctuations have occasionally been found in studies from Cura\u00e7ao, Bangladesh and China. The proportions of patients with GBS who have AIDP and AMAN vary greatly around the world. AIDP is the predominant subtype (60\u201380% of patients) in North America and Europe. By contrast, the frequency of AMAN ranges from 6\u20137% in the UK and Spain to 30\u201365% in Asia, Central America and South America. The geographical diversity is probably attributable to differences in exposure to certain types of infection, possibly in combination with different genetic susceptibilities due to varying genetic polymorphisms between individuals or groups of people living in different areas of the world. These differences may be related not only to the development of a specific GBS subtype, but also to the course and severity of disease. Genetic studies with a high number of patients are required to investigate these relationships.\nThe background incidence of GBS in most studies remains constant over time, although seasonal fluctuations have occasionally been found in studies from Cura\u00e7ao, Bangladesh and China.

These differences may be related not only to the development of a specific GBS subtype, but also to the course and severity of disease. Genetic studies with a high number of patients are required to investigate these relationships.\n\nPathogenesis:\nAs indicated above, GBS is a postinfectious disorder. Two-thirds of patients report symptoms of a respiratory or gastrointestinal tract infection before the onset of GBS. In about half of patients with GBS, a specific type of preceding infection can be identified, and C. jejuni is responsible for at least one-third of these infections. Other pathogens that cause antecedent infections related to GBS are cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013 Barr virus, Mycoplasma pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae, and influenza A virus. Notably, a case\u2013control study conducted in the Netherlands showed that 5% of patients with GBS had a hepatitis E virus infection before onset of GBS, compared with 0.5% of matched healthy controls. Similarly, 10% of patients with GBS from Bangladesh had an antecedent hepatitis E virus infection, indicating that hepatitis E virus is a worldwide trigger of GBS.30 However, despite the strong association between specific acute infections and GBS, the overall risk of developing this severe postinfectious complication is very small. Only one in 1,000\u20135,000 patients with Campylobacter enteritis will develop GBS in the subsequent 2 months.This fact explains why GBS is a sporadic disorder, although outbreaks of GBS after C. jejuni infection have occasionally been reported. One of the critical steps in GBS pathogenesis after C. jejuni infection is the generation of antibodies that crossreact with specific gangliosides (Figure 2), which are not produced during uncomplicated C. jejuni gastroenteritis. However, the production of crossreactive antibodies is only induced in susceptible individuals. Antibodies that crossreact with various gangliosides have been described in patients with GBS. However, only a subset of C. jejuni strains contain lipo-oligosaccharides that mimic the carbohydrate moiety of gangliosides that are present in human peripheral nerves (Figure 2). The synthesis of these ganglioside-mimicking carbohydrate structures depends on a set of polymorphic genes and enzymes that vary greatly between different C. jejuni strains. The Thr51 variant of the C. jejunicstII gene is associated with the occurrence of GBS, while the Asn51 variant is associated with MFS. Some antibody specificities are associated with particular GBS subtypes and related neurological deficits, reflecting the distribution of different gangliosides in human peripheral nerves (Table 1). C. jejuni infections are predominantly, but not exclusively, related to the AMAN or pure motor subtype of GBS. Patients with AMAN frequently have serum antibodies against GM1a, GM1b, GD1a and GalNAc-GD1a gangliosides. Patients with MFS or MFS\u2013GBS overlap syndrome (see below) frequently have antibodies against GD1b, GD3, GT1a and GQ1b gangliosides, which are related to ataxia and ophthalmoplegia. In a study from the Netherlands, 20% of patients with AIDP related to cytomegalovirus infection had anti-GM2 antibodies, although these antibodies are also found in patients with uncomplicated cytomegalovirus infections. Interestingly, as well as antibodies against single ganglio sides, patients can also have antibodies against combinations of epitopes from ganglioside complexes. Such complexes are located in specialized microdomains, or \u2018lipid rafts\u2019, in the cell membrane. Antibodies that target ganglioside complexes also crossreact with C. jejuni lipo-oligosaccharides, and are probably induced by a preceding infection with C. jejuni. Antibodies against various combinations or complexes of glycolipids have also been reported in patients with AIDP, although the role of these antibodies in its pathogenesis remains to be determined.\nFigure 2 | Immunopathogenesis of GBS: molecular mimicry and antiganglioside antibodies. Infections with pathogens, such as Campylobacter jejuni, can trigger humoral immune and autoimmune responses that result in nerve dysfunction and the symptoms of GBS. Lipo-oligosaccharides on the C. jejuni outer membrane may elicit the production of antibodies that crossreact with gangliosides, such as GM1 and GD1a on peripheral nerves. The antigens targeted in AMAN are located at or near the node of Ranvier. The anti-GM1 and anti-GD1a antibodies bind to the nodal axolemma, leading to complement activation followed by MAC formation and disappearance of voltage-gated sodium channels. This damage can lead to detachment of paranodal myelin, and nerve conduction failure. Macrophages then invade from the nodes into the periaxonal space, scavenging the injured axons. The antigens targeted in AIDP are, presumably, located on the myelin sheath. The antibodies can activate complement, which leads to formation of the MAC on the outer surface of Schwann cells, initiation of vesicular degeneration, and invasion of myelin by macrophages. Abbreviations: AIDP, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy; AMAN, acute motor axonal neuropathy; APC, antigen-presenting cell; GBS, Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome; MAC, membrane attack complex.\n\nIn conjunction with the presence of antiganglioside antibodies, complement activation seems to contribute to nerve degeneration in GBS\u2014a phenomenon that has been studied at the nodes of Ranvier and at the motor nerve terminal in a mouse model of AMAN. Sodium channel clusters, as well as paranodal axoglial junctions, the nodal cytoskeleton, and Schwann cell microvilli, all of which stabilize the sodium channel clusters, were disrupted by complement activation in a GBS disease model. Additional studies in a GBS mouse model provided evidence that blockade of complement activation prevents emergence of the clinical signs of antiganglioside-mediated neuropathy.61 The development of GBS after a C. jejuni infection may also depend on patient-related factors that influence the susceptibility to produce crossreactive, carbohydratetargeted antibodies. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that GBS has a relapse rate of 5%, which is clearly higher than would be expected by chance. The initial pathogen\u2013host interaction has a key role in the development of GBS. C. jejuni lipo-oligosaccharides bind to siglec-7 (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 7) and activate dendritic cells via Toll-like receptor 4 and CD14. These dendritic cells produce type 1 interferon and tumour necrosis factor (TNF), which induce proliferation of B cells. This immune activation could be influenced by genetic polymorphisms but, to date, genetic factors have only been studied in small cohorts of patients. Interestingly, a meta-analysis identified a moderate association between GBS and a particular TNF polymorphism. In addition, an association between polymorphisms in the MBL2 gene (encoding mannose-binding protein C) and the severity and outcome of GBS has been confirmed. Future genome wide association studies in large, well-described and adequately controlled cohorts are required to establish the role of host factors in the pathogenesis of GBS.\n\nThe potential role of vaccination:\nA few patients develop GBS shortly after receiving a vaccination. Despite their rarity, such events cause con siderable public concern. In the vaccination campaign against influenza A (H1N1) in the USA in 1976, the estimated attributable risk of vaccine-related GBS was about one in 100,000.66 A similar association was suggested for the vaccination campaign against influenza A (H1N1) in 2009, but extensive national and international studies found that vaccination was associated with only a small attributable risk of GBS: 1.6 excess cases of GBS per 1,000,000 vaccine recipients, a frequency similar to that for all seasonal vaccinations. In fact, vaccination might even reduce the risk of acquiring GBS, as this condition can be caused by infections such as influenza. The risk of developing GBS after influenza infection is estimated to be 4\u20137 times higher than after influenza vaccination. No relapses of GBS in patients with a history of this disease have been observed after influenza vaccination. For these reasons, the following practical guideline regarding vaccination of patients with a history of GBS is currently used in the Netherlands: GBS as such is not an indication for influenza vaccination, and vaccination seems to be safe in patients who developed GBS >3 months ago and when onset of GBS was not shortly after vaccination.\n\nDiagnosis:\nDiagnostic criteria:\nIn 1978, the US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) developed case definitions for GBS in the course of investigating the suspected association between GBS and the swine flu vaccination campaign of 1976\u20131977. The initial diagnostic criteria published in 1981 were modified in 1990. Though primarily developed for research purposes, they are probably still the most widely used criteria in clinical practice.4 The criteria consist of features that are required for or strongly support the diagnosis of GBS, and features that cast doubt on the diagnosis (Box 1). In 2011, the Brighton Collaboration published new case definitions for GBS while studying a possible association between GBS and the H1N1 swine flu vaccination campaign of 2009\u20132010. These criteria were specifically developed for retrospective epidemiological and vaccine safety studies and, consequently, are likely to combine high specificity with limited sensitivity. The Brighton criteria identify GBS with four levels of diagnostic certainty, from level 1 (highest) to level 4 (lowest). Use of the Brighton criteria to classify patients with suspected GBS is highly dependent on completeness of the diagnostic data. A study from the Netherlands in 335 patients with GBS with complete sets of diagnostic data\u2014which are required for level 1 certainty according to the Brighton criteria\u2014classified 61% as level 1, 33% as level 2, none as level 3 and 6% as level 4. However, patients diagnosed at different levels of diagnostic certainty did not differ in disease severity or outcome. In studies from Korea and India in patients who had GBS, 24% and 14% of patients, respectively, were classified as level 4. The Brighton criteria are not, however, intended to be used for diagnostic purposes in clinical practice. Further research is needed to develop criteria that can be used to diagnose GBS and its less-frequent variants in the acute phase of the disease. However, in practice, the criteria published in 1990 still provide a good basis for clinicians worldwide to make a diagnosis of GBS.\n\n\n\nTreatment:\nTreatment of GBS usually combines multidisciplinary supportive medical care and immunotherapy. Proven effective treatments for GBS are IVIg and plasma exchange. Immunotherapy is usually started if patients are not able to walk 10 m unaided (GBS Disability Scale score \u22653). Plasma exchange and IVIg have pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects, but we have yet to establish which effects explain their therapeutic efficacy in GBS, and whether the same effects are involved in all patients and all subtypes of GBS. IVIg treatment may inhibit Fc-mediated activation of immune cells, binding of antiganglioside antibodies to their neural targets or local complement activation. Serum IgG Fc glycosylation in patients with GBS seems to be associated with disease severity and could influence the immunomodulatory effects of IVIg. Plasma exchange is thought to remove neurotoxic antibodies, complement factors and other humoral mediators of inflammation. Plasma exchange is beneficial when performed within the first 4 weeks after onset of weakness in patients who are unable to walk unaided (GBS Disability Scale score \u22653), but the largest effect is seen when treatment is started within the first 2 weeks. The usual plasma exchange regimen consists of five treatments administered over 2 weeks, involving a total of about five plasma volumes. In mildly affected patients (still able to walk), however, two plasma exchange sessions induced more-rapid onset of motor recovery than did no plasma exchange. IVIg is effective in patients who are unable to walk 10 m unaided (GBS Disability Scale score \u22653) and when started within 2 weeks of onset of weakness. Randomized controlled trials showed that IVIg at a dose of 0.4 g/kg daily for 5 consecutive days (or 1 g/kg daily for 2 days) was as effective as a full course of five plasma exchange sessions applied over 2 weeks. Whether rapid IVIg treatment over 2 days is superior to treatment with the same total dose (2 g/kg) administered over 5 days has not been fully evaluated. However, one trial demonstrated that children receiving treatment over 2 days more frequently had treatment-related fluctuations than did children receiving treatment over 5 days. As IVIg therapy is widely available, does not require special equipment, and generally has only minor adverse effects, it has replaced plasma exchange as the preferred treatment for GBS in many hospitals. Immunoabsorption, as an alternative to plasma exchange, is occasionally used as a treatment for patients with GBS, and may be equally effective. However, no large-scale randomized controlled trials have shown that treatments other than IVIg or plasma exchange are effective. The choice of treatment depends on both patientrelated and socioeconomic factors. For instance, plasma exchange requires special equipment and is not always available in all hospitals. In addition, plasma exchange can be difficult to perform in young children, and care should be taken in patients with autonomic cardiovascular instability because of the large volume shifts involved in the plasma exchange procedure. However, the direct costs of IVIg treatment can be more than twice those of plasma exchange, making this treatment less attractive in low-income countries. In this respect, it is important to remember that most clinical trials of these treatments were conducted in Western Europe or North America and, therefore, predominantly involved patients who fulfilled the most commonly used GBS diagnostic criteria.4 The results of these trials might be less applicable in other parts of the world, especially where AMAN is highly prevalent. Whether patients with AMAN should receive the same treatment as those with AIDP remains uncertain. Results from a small study, which unfortunately had some methodological flaws, suggested that patients with AMAN might have better outcomes after treatment with plasma exchange than after IVIg therapy, and that plasma exchange was also the most cost-effective option. However, in countries where plasma exchange machines are not widely available or patients cannot afford this expensive procedure, small-volume plasma exchange or exchange transfusion can be a low-cost therapeutic option. Controlled studies of these procedures are currently lacking. The combination of plasma exchange followed by IVIg is not significantly better than either plasma exchange or IVIg alone. Oral steroids and intravenous methylprednisolone are not beneficial in patients with GBS. The combination of IVIg and methylprednisolone is no more effective than IVIg alone, although this combined treatment might have some additional short-term benefits when known prognostic factors are taken into account. Small randomized placebo-controlled trials of IFN-\u03b21a and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and one trial studying a 6 week course of mycophenolate mofetil combined with standard IVIg versus IVIg alone, did not indicate beneficial effects of these treatments. No randomized controlled trials have been performed in patients with MFS.126 A retrospective analysis showed that recovery starts slightly earlier in patients with MFS treated with IVIg than in those who were treated with plasma exchange or received no immunotherapy. However, final outcomes were the same in all three groups. Indeed, almost all patients with MFS recover fully, irrespective of whether they receive immunotherapy. Owing to the lack of evidence of a beneficial effect of IVIg or plasma exchange in patients with MFS, combined with the good natural recovery seen in these patients, withholding of immunotherapy in patients with MFS seems currently justified. However, patients with MFS\u2013GBS overlap syndrome can be severely affected, and treatment with IVIg or plasma exchange remains an option for these patients. Notably, no large-scale randomized controlled trials have been performed to determine the optimal treatment strategy in children with GBS and they are, therefore, usually treated in the same manner as adults with GBS.\n\nOngoing research:\nNearly a century after it was first described, GBS is still a life-threatening disorder that results in a poor outcome in at least 20% of patients and has persistent residual effects in the majority. Further research is urgently required to improve this situation. From a clinical perspective, the following are the most challenging needs: to develop improved diagnostic criteria for use in daily clinical practice, trials and vaccine safety studies; to determine the burden of disease caused by GBS worldwide; to develop new and better GBS outcome measures; to establish the precipitating events and patient-related factors that lead to GBS; to define biological and clinical predictors of the clinical course and outcome in individual patients; and, most importantly, to develop moreeffective and specific treatments, as well as protocols for supportive care. These aims can probably only be achieved by largescale international and multidisciplinary collaborations, such as the International GBS Outcome Study (IGOS), which was launched in 2012. Tissue samples and detailed, standardized clinical data are being collected during a follow-up period of 1\u20133 years with the intention of including at least 1,000 patients with GBS from all over the world. At present, centres from 17 countries\u2014 Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, Spain, South Africa, Taiwan, UK and the USA\u2014are recruiting patients. In addition, a randomized controlled trial, the SID-GBS study, is being conducted in the Netherlands. This trial is investigating the effect of a second course of IVIg given shortly after the first course in patients with GBS who have a poor prognosis (defined as a mEGOS score of 6\u201312 at 1 week after initiation of a standard 5 day course of IVIg). A related international study with an observational prospective design (I-SID-GBS) is investigating the same approach. This study is part of IGOS and is being performed by the Inflammatory Neuropathy Consortium. In addition, a new randomized placebo-controlled trial of eculizumab in patients with early GBS who are unable to walk is about to start. This study is partly based on findings in an animal model of GBS, in which antiganglioside antibodies induce complementdependent damage at the nodes of Ranvier, nerve terminals, and perisynaptic Schwann cells (Figure 2). Notably, these deleterious effects of complement on nerve terminals in mice can be blocked by the administration of eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to complement factor C5 and prevents its cleavage to C5a and the proinflammatory, cytolytic C5b-9 complex.61 Many other studies, such as those investigating pain treatment, nerve regeneration, and other factors that may improve the outcomes of patients with GBS, are eagerly awaited.\n\nLitrature Review:\nThe understanding of the disease mechanism of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome has evolved in recent years. Development of new treatments has been limited since immunotherapy was introduced in the 1980s and 1990s. An animal model (experimental autoimmune neuritis in rats) is often used for studies, and some agents have shown promise: glatiramer acetate, quinupramine, fasudil (an inhibitor of the Rhokinase enzyme) and the heart drug flecainide. An antibody targeted against the anti-GD3 antiganglioside antibody has shown benefit in laboratory research. Given the role of the complement system in GBS, it has been suggested that complement inhibitors (such as the drug eculizumab) may be effective\nSara Morsy et.al (2020) : The study suggests that NCAM may play a significant role in the immunopathogenesis of GBS. NCAM antibodies can be used as a marker for Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. However, more experimental studies are needed to prove these results. This study aimed at identifying human neural proteins that can be attacked by cross-reacting SARS-COV-2 antibodies causing Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. These markers can be used for the diagnosis of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS). To achieve this goal, proteins implicated in the development of GBS were retrieved from literature. These human proteins were compared to SARS-COV-2 surface proteins to identify homologous sequences using Blastp. Then, MHC-I and MHC-II epitopes were determined in the homologous sequences and used for further analysis. Similar human and SARS-COV-2 epitopes were docked to the corresponding MHC molecule to compare the binding pattern of human and SARS-COV-2 proteins to the MHC molecule.\nBadshah et al (2019) : The Zika virus (ZIKV) has gained attention for the last few years due to the congenital microcephaly and Guillain\u2013Barre Syndrome that resulted in humans. The non-structural protein (NS3) helicase of ZIKV play an important role in viral RNA replication. In this article, the researchers performed hundred nanosecond molecular dynamics simulation and molecular docking of the NS3 helicase of ZIKV with 1,4-benzothiazine derivatives.\nPier Paolo Sainaghi et al (2010) : Patients and methods: CSF samples were collected during a diagnostic lumbar puncture and stored at 30 C.Weanalyzed the CSF of nine subjects with GBS; eight with CIDP; eight with diabetic polyneuropathy (DP) and seven with headache (controls). Fifty inflammatory mediators were simultaneously measured with a multiplex bead-based ELISA on a Suspension Array System. After Bonferroni\u2019s correction for repeated measures, non-parametric variance and post hoc test were calculated. Results: Thirty-two inflammatory mediators were expressed. The median concentration of IL-6, IL-9, IL15, IL-18, CCL4, CXCL1, LIF, MIF, PDGFbb, IFN-c2, IL-2ra, IL-12(p40), IL-16, SCGF-b, TRAIL, FGF, G-CSF, GMCSF, and M-CSF was not different among groups (variance: n.s.). The median concentration of CCL2, CCL7, CCL27, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL12, ICAM1, VCAM1 and VEGF was higher in CIDP and GBS compared with controls (p < 0.002). The median concentration of IL-8 and IL-1ra was higher in GBS than CIDP or DP or controls, whereas stem cell factor (SCF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) were higher in CIDP than GBS or DP or controls (p < 0.002).\nMichiaki Koga et al (2023) Objective : To investigate the frequency of serum autoantibodies targeting contactin-associated protein 1 (Caspr1) and its complexes with other paranode antigens, contactin-1 (CNTN1) and neurofascin 155 (NF155), in Japanese patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP).\nResults :Anti-Caspr1 antibodies were present in one participant (case 1, 3.8%) of CIDP, and negative in all Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome patients and healthy participant. The detected anti-Caspr1 antibodies predominantly belonged to the immunoglobulin\u2009G4 subclass, and the addition of CNTN1 to Caspr1 as an antigen increased antibody reactivity, although the increase was just 20\u201330% at most. The presence of autoantibodies against paranode protein complexes, including Caspr1/CNTN1, Caspr1/NF155 and Caspr1/CNTN1/NF155, was confirmed in several CIDP patients, although they also had anti-Caspr1 or anti-NF155 antibodies; thus, in our cohort, there were no patients with autoantibodies that specifically recognized paranode protein complexes.\nJ\u00b4 er \u02c6ome J. Devaux , Masaaki Odaka , and Nobuhiro Yuki (2012) Neurofascin-186 (NF186), neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NrCAM), and gliomedin are adhesion molecules playing a central role in the formation of nodes of Ranvier. In Guillain-Barr\u00b4 e syndrome (GBS), immune attack toward the nodes may participate in the disabilities. Autoantibodies to NF186 and gliomedin have been detected in a rat model of GBS. Here, researcher investigated the prevalence of antibodies against nodal adhesion molecules in patients with GBS or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP).\nMingyun Shen et al (2013) : Rho kinases (ROCK1 and ROCK2) belong to serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) protein kinase family, and play the central roles in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Therefore, Rho kinases have become attractive targets for the treatments of many diseases, such as cancer, renal disease, hypertension, ischemia, and stroke. In order to develop small-molecule inhibitors of ROCK1, molecular docking was utilized to virtually screen two chemical databases and identify molecules that interact with ROCK1.\nMarc\u2019s Jacobs et.al (2005): The ROCK protein consists of several domains: an N-terminal region, a kinase catalytic domain, a coiled-coil domain containing a RhoA binding site, and a pleckstrin homology domain. The Cterminal region of ROCK binds to and inhibits the kinase catalytic domains, and this inhibition is reversed by binding RhoA, a small GTPase. This report present the structure of the N-terminal region and the kinase domain. In given protein two N-terminal regions interact to form a dimerization domain linking two kinase domains together. This spatial arrangement presents the kinase active sites and regulatory sequences on a common face affording the possibility of both kinases simultaneously interacting with a dimeric inhibitory domain or with a dimeric substrate. The kinase domain adopts a catalytically competent conformation; however, no phosphorylation of active site residues is observed in the structure. They also determined the structures of ROCK bound to four different ATP competitive small molecule inhibitors (Y-27632, fasudil , hydroxyfasudil, and H-1152P)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMolecular Docking:\nMolecular Docking is performed in four important steps \u2013\n1) Protein preparation\n2) Ligand preparation\n3) Receptor grid generation\n4) Molecular docking (Ligand docking)\n\nProtein Preparation:\nPreparing a protein for molecular docking, especially for rho kinase (ROCK), involves a meticulous series of steps aimed at ensuring its structural integrity and suitability for computational analysis. Firstly, the crystal structure of rho kinase is retrieved from a reliable protein structure database like the Protein Data Bank (PDB), ensuring high resolution and relevant ligands or co-factors if needed. Subsequently, the protein structure undergoes thorough preparation, which includes removing water molecules, heteroatoms, and any extraneous entities not pertinent to the docking study. Any structural irregularities or missing residues are corrected, and any hydrogen atoms missing from the structure are added. Energy minimization is then performed to alleviate steric clashes and optimize the protein\u2019s conformation for docking, utilizing molecular\nmodeling software such as GROMACS, CHARMM, or Schr\u00f6dinger suite, along with an appropriate force field.

However, despite predictions of its demise, disco did not vanish after 1983. Instead, it transformed and evolved, influencing a wide array of genres in the years that followed.\n\n### Influence and Evolution\n\n**1. House Music:**\nHouse music, emerging in the early 1980s in Chicago, is often considered a direct descendant of disco. It retained the danceable beats and sometimes the lush orchestrations of disco but incorporated new electronic instrumentation, such as drum machines and synthesizers, giving rise to a new genre that would dominate dance floors worldwide.\n\n**2. Hi-NRG:**\nHi-NRG is an uptempo evolution of disco that emphasizes strong beats and synthesized baselines. Popular in the 1980s, it provided an energetic soundtrack for many gay nightclubs during the decade. Artists like Sylvester and groups like The Weather Girls contributed to the vitality of Hi-NRG.\n\n**3. Post-Disco and Boogie:**\nPost-Disco refers to an era and style of music that emerged in the early 1980s, which toned down the orchestral elements but maintained the groove and some of the electronic elements of disco. Boogie, an offshoot of post-disco, incorporated funky beats with synthesizer-driven sounds, creating a laid-back, danceable style.\n\n**4. Eurodance and Italo Disco:**\nItalo Disco emerged in Europe as a genre distinct from U.S. disco, characterized by futuristic sounds and heavy use of synthesizers and drum machines. It laid the groundwork for Eurodance, a genre that enjoyed significant popularity in the 1990s with its catchy melodies and high-energy beats.\n\n### Legacy and Revival\n\nDisco's influence persisted into the 21st century, as seen in the nu-disco and electronic dance music (EDM) movements. Artists and producers have revisited the disco sound, incorporating its elements into modern tracks. Daft Punk's 2013 album \"Random Access Memories\" is a notable example, blending disco with electronic sounds to critical and commercial success. Additionally, many disco classics have been remixed or sampled in contemporary pop, hip hop, and electronic music, showcasing disco's enduring legacy.\n\nMoreover, disco has experienced various nostalgic revivals with club nights dedicated to the genre and its impact on fashion, culture, and music continued to be celebrated. The genre\u2019s influence on dance, DJ culture, and electronic music production cannot be overstated, making it an integral chapter in the history of popular music."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user requested an extremely annoying song, which was provided in a structured and repetitive format.

Looking at the notes, it seems I could I also interpret it as 6-4 time signature. Am I correct on this, and if so what is the functional difference in the time signatures?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, you're correct in observing that music notated in a 3-2 time signature can often look similar to that which is in 6-4, due to the relationship between the notes and beats per measure. However, their functional differences lie in how the rhythm is organized and felt in terms of accentuation and beat division.\n\n### 3-2 Time Signature\n\n- **3-2** signifies there are three half-note (minim) beats in each measure.\n- The emphasis typically falls on the first beat of each measure, leading to a **ONE two three** pattern.\n- It's often used in slower, more grandiose pieces, where each beat has a significant weight and presence.\n- The structure tends to lean towards triple meter, categorizing it more with **3/4** time, but with half-note beats instead of quarter-note beats.\n\n### 6-4 Time Signature\n\n- **6-4** implies that there are six quarter-note (crotchet) beats equivalent in duration to four dotted half notes (dotted minims) in each measure, since one dotted half note equals three quarter notes.\n- The accentuation can vary but often falls on the first and the fourth beats (or just the first in more flowing pieces), giving it a **ONE two three FOUR five six** pattern, which can slightly resemble a compound duple time signature (like 6/8, where the measure is divided into two beats, each subdivided into three).\n- 6-4 is effectively a compound meter and is often used in more flowing and lyrical pieces, where a sense of two larger beats subdivided into three is desired.\n  \n### Functional Differences\n\n- **Accent and Feel**: The primary difference lies in how the rhythms are accented and felt. 3-2 will have a stronger, more pronounced feel on the downbeat, with two less emphasized beats following. 6-4 can have a broader interpretation but will often have a dual accent pattern, feeling like two groups of three, or sometimes just a more elongated pattern with a primary accent at the start.\n- **Usage and Context**: 3-2 might be used to emphasize a powerful, solemn, or stately musical idea, where each beat is significant. 6-4 might lean towards fluidity and motion, possibly with a lyrical quality or a sense of spaciousness and breadth.\n\nWhile on paper, music written in 3-2 might look very similar to 6-4, how the music is interpreted and performed will highlight the distinctions between these time signatures. The choice between using one or the other can significantly affect the piece's overall feel and flow. Composers choose the time signature to best convey the rhythmic feel they wish to impart on the music and the listener."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I also notice that in some songs, the first measure will have one less beat than there should be, and then the last measure will have just one beat, seeming to make up for the one in the beginning. What is the point of this?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The scenario you're describing involves the use of what is called a \"pick-up measure\" or an \"anacrusis\". This is a common practice in many musical compositions to create a more natural and fluid beginning that leads into the main body of the piece. The idea is to start the music with an incomplete measure, which doesn't contain the full number of beats as indicated by the song's time signature. This initial measure leads up to the strong downbeat of the following, fully complete measure, thereby establishing the rhythmic and melodic flow of the piece from the outset.\n\n### Purpose of a Pick-up Measure\n\n- **Melodic Lead-In**: It serves as a musical introduction, setting up the melody in a way that feels natural. Starting directly on the downbeat can sometimes feel abrupt; the anacrusis allows the melody to ease into the first strong beat.\n- **Rhythmic Momentum**: The pick-up gives the piece a sense of forward momentum from the very beginning. It helps in establishing the tempo and feel of the rhythm before the first full measure.\n- **Harmonic Preparation**: In harmonic contexts, the notes in the anacrusis can prepare the listener's ear for the first chord or harmonic idea of the piece, creating a smoother transition.\n\n### Compensating with the Final Measure\n\nTo maintain the mathematical integrity of the music's structure and ensure that the total number of beats adds up correctly across the piece, composers often balance the initial pick-up measure with a final measure that is shortened by the exact length of the anacrusis. This creates a form of symmetry and ensures that the piece, when looped or repeated, transitions naturally back to the beginning or continues smoothly into another section.\n\n### Why It Matters\n\nThis approach is not just about adhering to formalities. It's a technique that enhances musical expression and listener engagement by creating a more compelling and cohesive rhythmic and melodic narrative. In essence, the pick-up measure and its compensating shortened final measure are tools composers use to articulate their musical ideas more effectively and to craft pieces that evoke specific feelings and responses in the listener.\n\nUnderstanding the function and effect of a pick-up measure provides insight into the composer's intentions and aids performers in delivering a more authentic and impactful rendition of the piece."}]}]}], "numConvs": 11}, {"summary": "The model engaged in brief, neutral greetings and provided factual, straightforward information about locations.

However, generational improvements in models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) typically include several advancements and differences which can be anticipated based on the progression from earlier versions. The exact differences between GPT-4 and GPT-3 would depend on what OpenAI decided to focus on, but generally, one could expect improvements along the following lines:\n\n1. **Scale**: GPT-4 might be larger in terms of the number of parameters, which could make it more powerful in terms of understanding and generating human-like text. GPT-3 already boasts 175 billion parameters; GPT-4 could surpass this, offering even more refined nuances in language understanding and generation.\n\n2. **Training Data**: GPT-4 would likely be trained on a more extensive and up-to-date dataset, incorporating more recent information and potentially offering more current insights and knowledge in its responses.\n\n3. **Efficiency and Optimization**: Innovations in training methods and model architecture can make GPT-4 more efficient, allowing for faster responses and lower computational costs. This can also include better handling of context and understanding of nuanced queries.\n\n4. **Reduced Biases and Errors**: Learning from the feedback and criticisms of GPT-3, GPT-4 might have improved mechanisms to handle biases and reduce the frequency of generating incorrect or nonsensical responses. OpenAI continuously works to mitigate these issues, and GPT-4 would likely reflect advancements in this area.\n\n5. **Fine-Tuning and Customization**: GPT-4 might offer more advanced and user-friendly options for fine-tuning, allowing developers to tailor the model more precisely to specific tasks or domains without needing exhaustive datasets for transfer learning.\n\n6. **Multimodality**: While GPT-3 is predominantly focused on text, OpenAI has been exploring multimodal models (e.g., DALL\u00b7E for images and CLIP for both text and images). There's a possibility that GPT-4 could incorporate or better integrate with multimodal capabilities, allowing for more versatile applications beyond just text.\n\n7. **Improved Context Handling**: One limitation of GPT-3 is its context window (the amount of text it can consider at one moment), which impacts its ability to maintain coherence over longer conversations or documents. GPT-4 could feature a larger context window or more innovative ways to understand and generate coherent long-form content.\n\n8. **Ethical and Safe Deployment**: Given the increasing scrutiny on AI ethics and safety, GPT-4 is expected to come with more robust safeguards against misuse, including better detection of harmful content generation and refined content filtering mechanisms.\n\nIt\u2019s important to stay updated with official announcements from OpenAI for the most accurate and detailed information on GPT-4's capabilities and innovations."}, {"role": "user", "content": "can you generate images"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As of my last update in April 2023, I can't create or manipulate images directly.

It was built in the late 18th century by Wolfgang von Kempelen, a Hungarian inventor, to impress Empress Maria Theresa of Austria-Hungary. Despite its appearance as an automated machine capable of making its own chess moves, The Turk was, in fact, a cleverly designed hoax.\n\nThe machine consisted of a life-sized model of a human head and torso dressed in Turkish attire, seated behind a large wooden cabinet. This cabinet contained a chessboard on its top surface. Within and beneath the cabinet were various gears and mechanisms designed to give the impression of an automated device.\n\nHowever, The Turk was operated by a human chess player cleverly concealed inside the cabinet. This person would control the movements of the mechanical arm to move the chess pieces on the board. The system was designed with sliding panels and a complex array of levers and mechanisms to ensure the operator remained hidden during the game. Operators of The Turk included skilled chess players of the time, some of whom were quite renowned.\n\nThe Turk toured Europe and the Americas for nearly 84 years, playing games against many opponents, including notable figures such as Napoleon Bonaparte and Benjamin Franklin, both of whom were defeated. The exhibition aroused great curiosity about the possibility of mechanical thinking and influenced the development of early computing and artificial intelligence concepts.\n\nThe secret behind The Turk's operation was not formally revealed until many years after its creation, leading to widespread speculation and myth about the possibility of a genuinely intelligent machine. It wasn't until the machine was destroyed by a fire in 1854 that the full extent of the deception became known to the public.\n\nToday, The Turk is remembered not only for its role as an elaborate hoax but also for its impact on the fields of automation, computing, and artificial intelligence, inspiring both scientists and the public to dream about machines capable of mimicking human intelligence and abilities."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user asked for help with a situation involving leaving work early without their boss noticing.

During this time, narrate your actions, plan your day, or even debate with yourself on various topics entirely in English.\n\n6. **Keep a diary in English**: Writing your thoughts and daily experiences in an English diary can significantly improve your ability to articulate thoughts in English. It also serves as good writing practice.\n\n7. **Join online forums or social media groups in English**: Engage in discussions on topics that interest you. This will not only improve your reading and writing but also encourage you to think in English as you formulate your thoughts and responses.\n\n8. **Practice mindfulness in English**: Try to practice mindfulness or meditation by focusing on your breath and body and describing your sensations and feelings in English.\n\n9. **Speak with native speakers or fellow learners**: Engaging in conversation, even if it's through online platforms, can significantly boost your confidence and encourage you to think in English more naturally.\n\n10. **Be patient and persistent**: Changing the language you think in isn't easy and takes time. Don't get discouraged by mistakes or if it feels awkward at first. With persistence, it will become more natural.\n\nRemember, the goal is to make English a part of your daily life as much as possible. It's a gradual process, but with consistent effort, you'll find yourself thinking and eventually speaking in English more fluently."}, {"role": "user", "content": "when i tell you some about situation, you could tell me 'word' right that situation,  okay?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Absolutely, I'd be happy to help with that.

Imagine them in funny costumes. A sheep in a superhero cape or a tutu leaps over a fence much more entertainingly.\n\n2. **Pajama Fashion Show**: Every night, strut around your bedroom in your PJs like you're on a high-fashion runway. Make it extra funny by announcing yourself as if you're the next top model of Sleepville.\n\n3. **Bedtime Story Roast**: Pick a classic bedtime story and give it a comedic roast. Make fun of the characters and their decisions. Laughing will relax you and make falling asleep easier.\n\n4. **The Blanket Burrito Challenge**: Wrap yourself tightly in your blanket like a burrito. The snug feeling is comforting, but the process of getting into \"burrito mode\" is hilariously fun.\n\n5. **Create a Sleep Playlist of Snoring**: Compile a playlist of snoring sounds. The absurdity of listening to snoring to fall asleep, rather than being kept awake by it, might just trick your brain into dozing off.\n\n6. **The Yawn Duel**: Partner up with someone and initiate a yawn off. The first person to yawn dramatically gets a point. This can make you both laugh and yawn more, encouraging sleep.\n\n7. **Sleeping Pose Competition**: Before bed, have a competition with your roommate, partner, or kids about who can create the most ridiculous sleeping pose. Snap photos for proof, share a good laugh, then settle down to sleep.\n\n8. **Midnight Snack Roulette**: Write down a bunch of safe, light midnight snacks on pieces of paper and draw one at random each night. The anticipation and the potential for bizarre combinations can be amusing.\n\n9. **Dream Journal Plot Twists**: Keep a dream journal by your bed, but add fictional, hilarious plot twists to your entries. It makes for a funny recap of your sleeping adventures and motivates you to remember and record dreams.\n\n10. **Pillow Fort Sanctuary**: Build a pillow fort around your bed for an amusing yet cozy sleep environment. Adding this playful element can make going to bed something to look forward to.\n\nRemember, while humor can relax the mind and prepare it for sleep, maintaining a good sleep hygiene is also crucial. So, while you try out these funny sleep improvement methods, don't forget the basics: a comfortable mattress, a cool room temperature, and keeping electronics at bay.

Some places might have a minimum amount for card payments, but this is rare.\n\n3. **Attractions and Museums**: Most attractions and museums accept card payments, and many recommend booking tickets online in advance.\n\n4. **Emergencies**: It's always wise to have a little cash for unforeseen needs, even in a largely cashless society.\n\nConsidering these factors, having around 500-1000 SEK (roughly 50-100 USD as of my last update in 2023) in cash might be more than enough for a week if you just want some cash on hand \"just in case.\" For most of your transactions, relying on a debit/credit card or mobile payment will be not only sufficient but preferred.\n\nDo, however, check with your bank about international transaction fees, and ensure your cards are enabled for use abroad to avoid any issues. It's also smart to inform your bank about your travel plans to prevent your foreign transactions from being flagged as fraudulent.\n\nLastly, always leave some room in your budget for unexpected expenses or emergencies. Enjoy your trip to Stockholm!"}]}, {"facetValue": "The user asked about payment methods in Europe and then inquired about kiosks disabling chip and PIN payments.

These preferences can vary widely depending on the country, city, and even within the same type of establishment, so it's essential to always have an alternative payment method.\n\n### 1. Public Transport Systems\nMany city and regional public transport systems across Europe, including buses, trams, and local trains, have adopted contactless payment options for convenience and speed. This includes:\n- Metro systems like those in London (Oyster and contactless) and Paris (Navigo Easy system).\n- Local city buses and regional trains that offer tap-on/tap-off payment systems.\n\n### 2. Small Retail and Quick Service Establishments\n- Coffee shops and fast-food chains are likely to prioritize contactless payments to speed up transactions.\n- Small kiosks, bakeries, and convenience stores, especially in high-traffic areas.\n\n### 3. Tourist Attractions\n- Museums, galleries, and landmarks often encourage contactless payments for tickets to streamline entry.\n- Public locker services at attractions or transport hubs.\n\n### 4. Events and Festivals\n- Music festivals, food fairs, and seasonal markets may opt for contactless payments for all transactions to reduce cash handling and queues.\n\n### 5. Vending Machines\n- Modern vending machines for snacks, drinks, and even electronic items increasingly support contactless payments.\n\n### 6. Parking\n- Street parking meters and some parking garages allow contactless payments for convenience.\n\n### Restrictions and Considerations\n- Despite the growing prevalence of contactless payments, regulations in some European countries ensure that merchants cannot outright refuse chip and PIN transactions if the card supports it. However, practical circumstances (such as a malfunctioning chip reader) might result in a preference for contactless.\n- Some establishments might prefer contactless payments to a point but can still process chip and PIN transactions if necessary.\n\nIt's crucial to note that this situation is fluid, and the adoption rates and policies can change. Travelers should always be prepared with multiple forms of payment, including contactless cards, mobile payment options (like Apple Pay or Google Wallet), and some amount of cash, to avoid any inconvenience."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is it common for kiosk to diable chip and PIN patients and allow only contactless ones?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As of my last update in April 2023, it is relatively uncommon for kiosks to disable chip and PIN payments entirely in favor of exclusively accepting contactless payments, though the prevalence of contactless technology is indeed on the rise globally, including in Europe. The shift towards contactless is driven by the convenience, speed, and hygienic advantages it offers, which became particularly attractive during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most payment systems are designed to accommodate a wide range of payment methods to ensure that as many customers as possible can complete transactions smoothly.\n\nHere are some pertinent points to consider regarding the adoption of contactless payments in kiosks and other points of sale:\n\n1. **Regulations and Customer Flexibility:** In many places, regulations and a desire to accommodate customers' preferences encourage merchants, including kiosks, to accept a variety of payment methods. Limiting payments strictly to contactless could exclude customers who do not have access to contactless-enabled cards or mobile payments, which is not ideal from a business perspective.\n\n2. **Technology Adoption:** While many new payment terminals support both contactless and chip (EMV) transactions, the decision to disable one form of payment over another is typically dictated by business needs, customer behavior, and sometimes technological limitations. For example, a vending machine or small kiosk in a location with a high volume of transactions and a need for quick throughput might favor contactless payments to reduce transaction times and queues.\n\n3. **Hardware and Software Limitations:** In some cases, a kiosk might experience hardware or software issues that temporarily limit its ability to process chip and PIN transactions, leaving contactless as the only available option. However, this would usually be seen as a fault to be repaired rather than a permanent condition.\n\n4. **Security Perspectives:** Both contactless and chip and PIN payments are considered secure, but the transaction limits on contactless payments (wherein larger transactions require PIN entry or another form of verification) serve as a fraud prevention measure. This might influence how businesses view the risk management of different payment types, though it doesn't directly lead to disabling chip and PIN capabilities.\n\nIn summary, while the prominence of contactless payments continues to grow, the outright disabling of chip and PIN capabilities in favor of exclusively contactless transactions is not common practice. Businesses, including those operating kiosks, generally aim to support a broad array of payment methods to ensure they can cater to all customers effectively. If a kiosk or another point of sale does seem to have disabled chip and PIN payments, it's more likely to be an exception rather than a widespread trend."}]}]}, {"summary": "The model provided factual, neutral, and straightforward information about various locations and institutions.

Its geography is marked by a mix of urban development and green spaces, with a varied topography that includes several notable geographical features. Here's an overview of Croydon's geographical landscape:\n\n### Topography and Landscape\n\nCroydon is situated on the north edge of the North Downs, a ridge of chalk hills extending from Farnham in Surrey to the White Cliffs of Dover in Kent. The town's landscape slopes upwards towards the south, reaching elevations around 120 meters above sea level in some southern parts like Sanderstead Hill. This southward rise leads into more rural and wooded areas, contrasting with the more urban and flat terrain found in the northern parts of the borough.\n\n### Urban Development and Green Spaces\n\nThe town center of Croydon has undergone significant redevelopment and urbanization, particularly in the 20th and 21st centuries. It boasts a substantial commercial district with shopping centers, office buildings, and residential developments. Despite this urban character, Croydon is also home to numerous parks and green spaces. Notable among these are Lloyd Park, South Norwood Country Park, and Coombe Wood, which provide residents and visitors with a respite from the urban environment.\n\n### Rivers and Water Bodies\n\nCroydon does not have major rivers flowing prominently through it, but it is bordered by or includes several smaller rivers and streams. The River Wandle is one such example, originating in Croydon and flowing northwards towards Wandsworth and eventually the River Thames. Other water bodies include the Norbury Brook and the Pool River, contributing to the area's drainage and forming part of the green corridors that support wildlife within the urban setting.\n\n### Administrative Geography\n\nAdministratively, Croydon is part of Greater London and is governed by the London Borough of Croydon. It is subdivided into several districts and neighborhoods, each with its own distinctive character, ranging from more densely populated urban areas around the town center to leafier, suburban locales on its outskirts.\n\n### Transport and Infrastructure\n\nCroydon's geography is well-served by public transport infrastructure, including a major railway station (East Croydon), Tramlink - a light rail tram system serving South London, and numerous bus routes. The town also sits near major roads such as the A23 and the M25 motorway, providing connections to the rest of London and to the South East of England. \n\nOverall, Croydon's geography presents a blend of urban and suburban elements, bordered by and integrated with natural landscapes and green spaces, reflecting the diversity and complexity typical of many London boroughs."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user asked about the Supreme Court of Portugal and the response provided detailed information about its structure and jurisdiction.
