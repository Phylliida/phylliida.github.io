Links are crucial for providing references, guiding readers to additional resources, and improving SEO. Here's a breakdown of the different types of links you might consider including in your handbook:\n\n### 1. Internal Links\nThese are links that point to another page within the same website. Internal links help improve site navigation, assist with website hierarchy, and distribute page authority throughout the site.\n\n### 2. External Links\nExternal links lead the reader to a different website. These are used to provide references, additional information, or direct readers to a partner site. They are beneficial for creating a network of trusted sources and can also contribute to an improved user experience.\n\n### 3. Anchor Links\nAlso known as jump links, anchor links take the user to a specific part of the same page they are currently on. This is particularly useful for long-form content where navigating to different sections directly enhances reader experience.\n\n### 4. Dofollow Links\nBy default, all links are considered \"dofollow,\" meaning that they pass on link equity or \"link juice.\" This is significant for SEO as it helps in determining the ranking of the website to which it links.\n\n### 5. Nofollow Links\nThese links include a `rel=\"nofollow\"` tag in their HTML, instructing search engines not to follow the link or pass on link equity. Nofollow links are used when linking to unverified content or to limit the impact of paid links on search engine rankings.\n\n### 6. Sponsored Links\nSponsored links include a `rel=\"sponsored\"` tag to indicate that the link was paid for or is part of an advertisement. This is a way to clearly mark advertising content for both users and search engines.\n\n### 7. UGC (User Generated Content) Links\nLinks marked with a `rel=\"ugc\"` tag are found within user-generated content, such as comments and forum posts. They indicate to search engines that the link was not created by the site's owner and thus may not represent the site's endorsement of the linked content.\n\n### 8. Deep Links\nDeep links direct users to a specific, often nested page on a website or within an application. These are particularly useful for mobile apps, allowing users to open the app directly to a specific piece of content.\n\n### 9. Broken Links\nBroken links lead to a webpage that no longer exists. Identifying and fixing broken links is crucial for maintaining a good user experience and website health.\n\n### 10. Redirected Links\nThese links point to a URL that then redirects to another. While redirections (like 301 redirects) are sometimes necessary, excessive use can slow down your site and create a frustrating user experience.\n\n### Special Mention: Mailto and Tel Links\n- **Mailto Links**: When clicked, these links open the default email client with the recipient's email address pre-filled.\n- **Tel Links**: Clicking on these links prompts the device to start a phone call, making it easier for users to contact you or your business.\n\nIn your handbook, it may be beneficial to explain why and how these different types of links are used, providing content authors with the knowledge to effectively incorporate them into their work.

Anchor Links\n**Description:** Special links that direct the user to a specific section within the same webpage, improving navigation on long pages by allowing users to jump to relevant information quickly.\n\n### 4. Dofollow Links\n**Description:** The default type of link which allows search engines to follow them and pass on link equity to help with the ranking of the linked page.\n\n### 5. Nofollow Links\n**Description:** Links marked to tell search engines not to follow them or pass on link equity, used for linking to unverified content or to comply with search engine guidelines on sponsored links.\n\n### 6. Sponsored Links\n**Description:** Links identified with a tag indicating they're part of an advertisement or sponsored content, clearly marking paid relationships.\n\n### 7. UGC (User Generated Content) Links\n**Description:** Links within user-generated content like comments or forum posts, marked to indicate that they may not have the site owner\u2019s endorsement, helping manage the quality of outbound links.\n\n### 8. Deep Links\n**Description:** Links that direct users to a specific, often deeply nested content page or section, either on a website or within a mobile app, enhancing direct access to relevant content.\n\n### 9. Broken Links\n**Description:** Links that lead to non-existent pages, resulting in poor user experience and negatively affecting a website's SEO, which necessitates regular audits and fixes.\n\n### 10. Redirected Links\n**Description:** Links that automatically forward users to a different URL than the one originally clicked, generally used for directing traffic from old to new content or during website restructure.\n\n### Special Mention: Mailto and Tel Links\n- **Mailto Links**\n  **Description:** Links that, when clicked, open the user's default email program with the recipient's email address pre-filled, facilitating immediate contact via email.\n\n- **Tel Links**\n  **Description:** Links created to initiate a phone call when clicked, directly connecting users to a phone number, ideal for mobile experiences where instant call capability can enhance user convenience.\n\nThese descriptions provide a comprehensive overview of the different types of links content authors may encounter or use.
