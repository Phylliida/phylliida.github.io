Without \"Skunk Fu!\", Kids' WB might have opted for another animated series that could appeal to its target demographic of children and young teens, focusing on adventure, comedy, or possibly another action-oriented show to maintain the balance and appeal of the schedule.\n\nThe 2007-2008 schedule for Kids' WB was varied, including shows like:\n\n- \"The Batman\"\n- \"Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!\"\n- \"Tom and Jerry Tales\"\n- \"Legion of Super Heroes\"\n- \"Johnny Test\"\n- \"Loonatics Unleashed\"\n- \"Will and Dewitt\"\n- \"Magi-Nation\"\n\nWithout \"Skunk Fu!\", the network might have increased the number of episodes or reruns of any of the existing shows in the lineup. Alternatively, Kids' WB could have introduced another acquisition or fast-tracked a show that was planned for a later release. The selection would heavily depend on what content was available at the time that could meet broadcasting standards for children's programming and also fit within the thematic and entertainment value that Kids' WB aimed to provide.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that during this era, networks were adapting to changes in viewership patterns, including the rise of digital content and online streaming.

It was renowned for its distinctive branding, innovative promotions, and a lineup of high-quality original and acquired programming, which made it a significant player in children's entertainment throughout its run. The branding of Kids' WB played a crucial role in its success and differentiation in the crowded market of children's television.\n\n### Logo and Visual Identity\n\nThe visual identity of Kids' WB heavily relied on colorful, dynamic logos and mascots, which were designed to capture the attention of its target audience\u2014children aged 6 to 11 years. The logo and promotional materials often featured bright colors and animated characters from their various shows. This approach helped Kids' WB create a lively and inviting atmosphere that appealed directly to kids, making the branding instantly recognizable.\n\n### Themes and Interstitials\n\nKids' WB was known for its creative interstitials and thematic promotions that incorporated characters from its shows into various comedic skits, contests, and interactive segments. These integrated promotions not only helped to maintain viewers' interest during breaks but also reinforced the branding by emphasizing the channel's characters and worlds. The use of themes, such as Halloween or summer specials, enabled Kids' WB to create memorable events that kids looked forward to.\n\n### Programming Strategy\n\nThe programming strategy was central to Kids' WB's branding. By securing popular titles such as \"Animaniacs,\" \"Batman: The Animated Series,\" \"Pok\u00e9mon,\" and \"Yu-Gi-Oh!,\" Kids' WB positioned itself as the go-to destination for action-packed and humorous children's programming. The block's success with these shows helped to establish its identity as a powerhouse of children's entertainment and fostered a loyal viewership.\n\n### Promotions and Partnerships\n\nKids' WB effectively leveraged promotions and partnerships to enhance its branding. This included tie-ins with fast-food chains, toy companies, and video games that featured Kids' WB characters and shows. Such collaborations not only expanded the reach of Kids' WB's branding but also deepened engagement with its audience by allowing kids to interact with their favorite characters in various forms outside of the television screen.\n\n### Transition to The CW\n\nIn 2006, The WB and UPN networks merged to form The CW, and Kids' WB continued to air on this new network until it was discontinued on May 17, 2008. The brand lived on briefly as an online network before being fully absorbed into other entities. Throughout its existence, Kids' WB's branding remained focused on entertaining, engaging, and resonating with a generation of kids, leaving a lasting legacy in the world of children's television.\n\nOverall, Kids' WB's strategic use of engaging visuals, thematic content, popular programming, and collaborative promotions created a strong, distinct brand identity that captured and held the attention of a young audience, securing its place in the annals of beloved children's entertainment brands."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What would Kids WB's Fall 2008 lineup have looked if it hadn't been brutally merged with 4Kids TV"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Speculating on what the Kids' WB Fall 2008 lineup could have looked like had it not been merged with 4Kids TV involves a theoretical exploration based on the trends, popular shows of the time, and the direction in which children's programming was heading. During its peak, Kids' WB was known for a blend of animated action, adventure series, and comedies that appealed broadly to children. With that in mind, we can imagine a lineup that might have included continuing popular series from its past, introducing new shows with potential, and maybe even reviving or rebooting classic properties to leverage nostalgia while appealing to a new generation.\n\n### Continuing Series\n\n1. **\"Pok\u00e9mon\" Series Continuation** - Given the enduring popularity of \"Pok\u00e9mon,\" it's likely Kids' WB would continue airing the latest seasons. By Fall 2008, this would align with \"Pok\u00e9mon: Diamond and Pearl\" series.\n   \n2. **\"Yu-Gi-Oh!\" Franchise** - Another staple of the block, a new iteration of \"Yu-Gi-Oh!\" such as \"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's,\" which premiered in Japan in 2008, could have found a spot in the lineup, continuing the legacy of the franchise on Kids' WB.\n\n### New Introductions\n\n1. **Action-Adventure Properties** - Seeing the popularity of superhero and action-adventure genres, Kids' WB could have introduced new or adapted series in this vein. Considering the era's trends, a show based on a popular comic or an original superhero series could have been likely candidates.\n\n2. **Animated Comedies** - Comedies were a significant part of Kids' WB's appeal. New original comedies or adaptations of popular children's books or graphic novels that hadn't been explored on screen yet could have been part of the lineup.\n\n3. **\"Ben 10: Alien Force\"** - While Cartoon Network was the primary network for \"Ben 10,\" given the close relationship between networks under the Warner Bros. umbrella, it's conceivable a hit series like \"Ben 10: Alien Force\" could have been shared or simulcast as part of a strategy to boost viewership across both platforms.\n\n### Possible Revivals or Reboots\n\n1. **\"Animaniacs\"** - Before its actual revival on streaming platforms, Kids' WB could have potentially looked into reviving popular shows from its past like \"Animaniacs\" to capitalize on nostalgia while introducing the zany humor to a new generation.\n\n2. **\"Batman: The Animated Series\"** - Given the timeless popularity of Batman and the acclaim of the original series, a reboot or continuation, perhaps in the vein of \"Batman: The Brave and the Bold\" which premiered in 2008, might have been a strategic addition to the lineup.\n\n### Educational or Hybrid Programs\n\nFollowing the trend towards educational content, Kids' WB might have introduced shows with educational elements woven into entertaining narratives, possibly in collaboration with producers known for creating engaging children's content that also teaches valuable skills or lessons.\n\nIt's important to note that this speculation considers the trends and the landscape of children's TV programming during that period. Kids' WB had a knack for creating and curating content that resonated with its audience, and whatever direction they would have taken for the Fall 2008 lineup, it's reasonable to assume it would have been diverse, entertaining, and designed to appeal to the wide range of interests among its young viewers."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What CW4Kids shows would have came"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The CW4Kids was launched on May 24, 2008, as a successor to Kids' WB on The CW network, and was programmed by 4Kids Entertainment. Its lineup featured a mix of original shows, continued series from the Kids' WB era, and new acquisitions that fit into 4Kids' strategy of offering engaging, action-packed, and often anime-based content. Reflecting on the types of shows that came during and after the transition, we can identify several series that defined or would have continued to shape the CW4Kids lineup, particularly in its early stages and beyond.\n\n### Shows That Aired on CW4Kids/Toonzai\n\n1. **\"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's\"** - Continuing the \"Yu-Gi-Oh!\" legacy, \"5D's\" featured a new generation of duelists and introduced motorcycle dueling in a futuristic setting. It was a cornerstone of the CW4Kids lineup due to the franchise's enduring popularity.\n\n2. **\"Sonic X\"** - This series, which follows Sonic the Hedgehog and his friends in their adventures to save the world from the evil Dr. Eggman, continued to be a part of the lineup after transitioning from Kids' WB to CW4Kids.\n\n3. **\"Dinosaur King\"** - An anime that blends dinosaurs and trading card gaming, \"Dinosaur King\" was precisely the type of show that resonated with 4Kids' target demographic, offering action, adventure, and a collectible aspect.\n\n4. **\"Huntik: Secrets & Seekers\"** - A show based on the concept of seekers using magical amulets to summon titans in their battle against evil, \"Huntik\" fit well into the adventure and fantasy genres popular with the network's audience.\n\n5. **\"Dragon Ball Z Kai\"** - A revised and remastered version of \"Dragon Ball Z,\" \"Kai\" was streamlined to more closely follow the manga's storyline. Its inclusion in the lineup brought a beloved franchise to a new generation.\n\n### Speculative Additions:\n\nHad CW4Kids continued or if we're imagining what other shows could have fit into its lineup based on trends and availability at the time:\n\n1. **\"Beyblade\" Series (Metal Saga)** - Given the popularity of \"Beyblade\" and its competitive, battle-centric storyline, newer seasons like \"Beyblade: Metal Fusion\" and its successors could have been a strong addition, aligning well with the action-adventure focus of CW4Kids.\n\n2. **\"Pok\u00e9mon\" Series** - Although mostly associated with competing networks in the U.S., should licensing have allowed, continuing new seasons of \"Pok\u00e9mon\" would have been a natural fit for maintaining a strong viewership, especially following its history on Kids' WB.\n\n3. **More Culturally Diverse Series** - Reflecting a growing trend towards inclusivity and global storytelling, CW4Kids might have explored more anime or animated series rooted in diverse cultures and stories, expanding beyond the predominantly Japanese-based anime offerings.\n\n4. **Educational/Action Hybrids** - Following regulations and the demand for educational content, CW4Kids could have looked into more shows that blend action and adventure with subtle educational themes, perhaps focusing on history, science, or cultural awareness.\n\nIt's important to note that while CW4Kids leaned heavily into anime and action-packed series, the evolving landscape of children's entertainment, including the rise of digital platforms and changing viewer habits, would likely have influenced the direction and type of shows it introduced in subsequent years."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user engaged in a detailed and ongoing conversation about a fictional alternate universe where Kids WB continued to operate, discussing schedule changes, show returns, and network transitions.

But, this is the life of a cartoon fan, right? Out with the old, in with the\u2026 older? \ud83d\ude02\n\nBacteriophage_: Robotboy\u2019s return is quite a surprise. It had that classic boy-and-his-robot vibe. Also, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks? That\u2019s quite the throwback. For those who don\u2019t remember, Chop Socky Chooks was this wild mix of kung fu and chickens\u2014only in cartoons, folks!\n\nCartoonAficionado: Don\u2019t forget about the fall bonanza!

Those shows had such depth in storytelling and character development. But Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated is not to be slept on. That iteration has some of the best arcs for our mystery-solving gang!\n\nScienceRules45: Batman: The Brave and the Bold was a gem! It didn\u2019t take itself too seriously and had just the right amount of camp.

Also, major props to Kids WB for the diversity in its programming\u2014you\u2019ve got old hits, modern takes, and now a homegrown web series making it to the big leagues.\n\nAdmin5: The summer is looking quite adventurous with all the fresh and returning programming we have on our hands! If \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d or Code Lyoko capture your hearts, be sure to come back and let everyone know. Enjoy the shows, everyone, and let\u2019s support those indie creators making waves!\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up where another mid-season show premieres, replacing Gumball, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\nThread Title: Mid-Season Update: The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Replace Gumball on Kids WB! \ud83e\udd29\ud83c\udfaa\n\nTheComicNerd21: Big news for Kids WB watchers! \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d is premiering mid-season, taking the spot \u201cThe Amazing World of Gumball\u201d left behind. I\u2019ve got high hopes that these thrill-seeking siblings will bring the same level of zany to the lineup. Can they live up to the hilarity of Gumball, though? That\u2019s the big question.\n\nGreenJelly223: Gumball\u2019s out?! Say it isn\u2019t so! That show was a staple! But I remember The Adrenalini Brothers from awhile back\u2026they were full of over-the-top stunts and accents. Hopefully, they can fill the quirky cartoon void that\u2019s gonna be left in Gumball\u2019s wake.\n\nCartoonAficionado: \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d are pure comedic gold with those daredevil antics. Gumball set a high bar for humor and heart, but if you want outrageous adventures and laughs, the Adrenalinis could be just the ticket.\n\nArtsyOwl: I admit, I\u2019ll miss the random humor and clever writing of Gumball. It was one of those shows that had something for viewers of all ages. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have a different flavor, but I\u2019m definitely willing to give them a shot.\n\nBacteriophage_: Well folks, all good things must come to an end, but at least the high-paced energy of The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers might fill the void. They\u2019re not new to the cartoon scene, but let\u2019s hope their stunts are as amazing as ever.\n\nMicrobeMania: \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d is a throwback! Those guys pull off some wild stunts. Kids WB seems to be aiming for high octane to take Gumball\u2019s place. Keeping my fingers crossed that they keep delivering fresh content, even in the form of older gems getting the spotlight again.\n\nRestInToons: Guess it\u2019s goodbye to Gumball and hello Adrenalini. I remember the brothers having quite the international flair. Their eclectic style should make for a refreshing change of pace. Plus, with Squish and the others, Kids WB\u2019s variety is still on point.\n\nAmoebaAmy: My kids loved Gumball, so they\u2019re a bit gutted. But I think The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u2019 daredevil acts might just win them over. I\u2019m always down for more shenanigans. Here\u2019s hoping they get as much character-driven hilarity as Gumball had.\n\nScienceRules45: Gumball\u2019s creativity was unmatched, but The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers? That\u2019s a nostalgia trip! Will be interesting to see how a show that\u2019s been off the radar for a while resonates with the current audience.\n\nHappyMom200: My Gumball marathon nights are coming to an end it seems. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have some big shoes to fill, but I\u2019m ready for the laughs. In Kids WB we trust, right? \ud83d\ude02\n\nAdmin5: Change is part of every TV network\u2019s lifecycle. \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d could be what kids WB needs to shake things up. Let\u2019s give these fearless brothers a chance and reconvene here to discuss the stunts, humor, and how the show fits into the new dynamic!\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up in fall when the new shows premiere, Lyoko is sticking around, Gumball and Craig are back, but won\u2019t be for long, leaving again in January, Also, a user says Skatoony will definitely be back next year, as it has been a summer replacement show since 2018\nThread Title: Fall Premieres are Here! Welcome Back Craig & Gumball + Code Lyoko Stays! \ud83c\udf42\ud83d\udcfa\n\nGreenJelly223: It\u2019s fall premiere season, everyone! And with the leaves changing comes new changes to Kids WB. Code Lyoko has secured its spot on the schedule, which I know some of you are thrilled about. The Amazing World of Gumball and Craig of the Creek are making a short-lived comeback, dipping out again in January. Can\u2019t get enough of those two, so I\u2019m here for any time they\u2019re on.\n\nCartoonAficionado: Great to have Gumball and Craig back, even if it\u2019s just for a quick hello and goodbye. It\u2019s like that favorite seasonal dish you can\u2019t stop craving. And Code Lyoko sticking around? Love that for us\u2014those virtual vibes aren\u2019t going anywhere!\n\nTheComicNerd21: Ah, the temporary returns of Gumball and Craig are bittersweet. Makes you wish they\u2019d just stick around full-time. But, I gotta say, Code Lyoko keeping its slot is A-okay with me. That\u2019s one show I\u2019ve been seriously getting back into.\n\nArtsyOwl: The quality storytelling in Craig of the Creek will be sorely missed once January rolls around. And Gumball\u2014it just has that rewatchability factor like no other. Soak it up while you can, folks!\n\nMicrobeMania: Just dropping in to say that Skatoony is going to be back next summer, and I\u2019m here for it! It\u2019s kind of become the unofficial summer tradition since 2018, hasn\u2019t it? Always great to see a show that knows how to fill its seasonal shoes.\n\nBacteriophage_: Yeah, Skatoony\u2019s like that cool summer camp you get excited about all year. But let\u2019s not overlook the fall newcomers too\u2014I\u2019m already setting reminders for Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The superhero binge is real!\n\nRestInToons: Mixed feelings about the short-term return of Gumball and Craig of the Creek. At least we know Kids WB is good at giving us something to look forward to. As for Code Lyoko, it\u2019s been interesting to see a show from yesteryear find its groove with the audience today.\n\nAmoebaAmy: The limited time with Gumball and Craig is better than no time! Let\u2019s enjoy the laughs and adventures while they last. And happy to have confirmed scoops like the one about Skatoony return\u2014it\u2019s this kind of knowledge that keeps the fandom ticking.\n\nScienceRules45: I\u2019ve gotten used to the shift and shuffle of Kids WB\u2019s schedule. You learn to appreciate what you\u2019ve got when you\u2019ve got it. That said, I\u2019m diving headfirst into the nostalgia and newness of this fall\u2019s lineup. It\u2019s going to be an entertaining season!\n\nHappyMom200: I\u2019m grateful for any sprinkles of Craig of the Creek episodes we get! It\u2019s such a gem. And does anyone else get way too competitive watching Skatoony, or is that just me? \ud83d\ude02 Super stoked about its return next year!\n\nAdmin5: Some very astute observations and a tangible excitement for the new and returning shows this fall! Let\u2019s enjoy this season\u2019s offerings, and, as always, keep the conversations engaging as we head into the new year with all its sure-to-be-surprising programming and inevitable farewells.\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up in 2023 where G&G are still rerunning, but Batman, Scooby and Spidey are off, replaced with Ozzy and Drix, World of Quest and Skatoony for summer\nThread Title: 2023 Kids WB Update: Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest & Skatoony Take Over Summer! \ud83c\udf1e\ud83d\udc7e\n\nGreenJelly223: Hey toon enthusiasts! As we hit the sunny stride of 2023, Kids WB is switching up the schedule. We\u2019re saying bye to Batman, Scooby, and Spidey. But don\u2019t despair\u2014Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest, and the ever-reliable Skatoony are here for those summer vibes. Also, \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d are still doing the rerun rounds. Keeping it fresh and funky!\n\nCartoonAficionado: Honestly, it\u2019s cool to see Ozzy & Drix making a comeback. That show was always under the radar but it delivered some solid laughs plus a bit of body-function education. Let\u2019s see how it holds up today!\n\nTheComicNerd21: No more Batman and Spidey is a bummer, but you know what? Bring on the Ozzy & Drix and World of Quest! I remember World of Quest being pretty out there with its humor, a good mix of action and oddball characters\u2014definitely fitting for the wacky tone of summer.\n\nMicrobeMania: Ozzy & Drix, that\u2019s a throwback! I had a feeling it could make a resurgence. Educational and entertaining\u2014that\u2019s a tough balance to strike, but that show had it. Also, cheers to year 5 of summer Skatoony\u2014it\u2019s tradition at this point!\n\nArtsyOwl: Hey, \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d are still in the reruns, too! Shimmering on\u2014quite literally, thanks to Glitter. It\u2019s a quirky and cute show, glad it\u2019s still around for the little ones to enjoy.\n\nBacteriophage_: Seeing World of Quest drop into the lineup makes me hopeful that Kids WB is dedicated to keeping variety alive. Adventure, humor, outright weirdness\u2014it\u2019s got it all. And combined with the educational fun from Ozzy & Drix, plus the game show laughs from Skatoony? Count me in for the summer!\n\nRestInToons: Sayonara superheroes! This season\u2019s lineup shows that kids\u2019 programming isn\u2019t just about capes and villains. It\u2019s about variety, surprise, and a touch of nostalgia. Let\u2019s get microscopic with Ozzy & Drix and go on a wild ride with Quest and Nestor!\n\nAmoebaAmy: Always a tad sad to see the Scooby gang go, but switching up genres keeps things interesting. Ozzy & Drix is kind of like \u201cThe Magic School Bus\u201d for the older crowd, and I\u2019m here for it! Plus, Skatoony is something my kids look forward to every year\u2014glad it\u2019s not going anywhere!\n\nScienceRules45: I\u2019ve got to say, I appreciate how Kids WB keeps mixing in educational content amidst all the comedy and action. Ozzy & Drix is a blast from the past that I\u2019m excited to revisit. It\u2019s just what we need in a world that could use a refresher on health and the human body!\n\nHappyMom200: World of Quest is an underrated treasure, and I\u2019m thrilled it\u2019s coming back into the spotlight. It\u2019s like that fun summer book series but animated. And Skatoony is practically synonymous with summer now; glad to know some things stay solid.\n\nAdmin5: The summer outlook is looking diverse and delightful! With shows that cater to every kind of young fan, there\u2019s no shortage of entertainment. Let\u2019s keep track of these changes and see how they fare in the warm months ahead.

The way they went about this was interesting, In December they started airing promos saying that from January 7 the network would be changing it\u2019s name, it didn\u2019t tell us that 4Kids are now in charge or that there would be new shows, the promo just showed the usual KWB shows like Squish, TAAB, TTG, XS, etc. Also today the promo for the next schedule change (dubbed a Super Duper Late Winter Lineup) has a new slogan \u201cYou\u2019re signed on to the CW4Kids\u201d Slow and painful rebrand? \ud83d\ude12, If you\u2019re not gonna change the bumpers untill Easter then why reveal your flashy new slogan now. Also the website (thecw4kids.com) STILL says this at the footer \u201c\u00a9 2024 Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Global, Nexstar Media Group\u201d Hopefully it is updated to reflect 4Kids\u2019s involvement soon. Write a follow up forum convo where they talk more about the slow transition, and that GoGoRiki is cute, and that it could be primed to take over most of the current comedy cartoons\nThread Title: CW4Kids: A Slow Transition & The Future of Cartoons on the Block? \ud83d\udd04\ud83d\udcfa\n\nToonMasterJay: So, has anyone else noticed how the CW4Kids transition is kinda like watching paint dry? The bumpers feel like Kids WB is haunting us. And they\u2019re dropping their new slogan already, but the website footer is still all about the old guard\u2026 Mixed signals much?\n\nDigitalToonFan: Yeah, the transition is definitely dragging its feet. I mean, if you\u2019re going to bring in 4Kids, then do it with a bang! Not this half-Zoom half-real-life meeting vibe. The new lineup switches could be cool though, but I\u2019ll miss Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers for sure.\n\nGoGoFan223: Honestly, I\u2019m most excited about GoGoRiki (or Smeshariki for the purists). It\u2019s cute and has that potential to be big with the comedy crowd. Less about the action and more laughs\u2014could be the perfect fit for the new direction they\u2019re aiming for.\n\nSonicXforever: Still processing the swap of Squish for Pok\u00e9mon and TAAB for Sonic X\u2026 I mean, sure, classics! But Sonic X has been rerun how many times now? I guess they\u2019re banking on that nostalgia factor to reel us in while they\u2019re redecorating.\n\nPokeNostalgia101: Not going to lie, I\u2019m excited to have Pok\u00e9mon Indigo League back\u2014it\u2019s like comfort food for my soul. But I hear you all, the change is weirdly slow. I get that it\u2019s a big shift from Kids WB to full-on 4Kids ownership, yet you\u2019d think they\u2019d want to make their mark quick.\n\nLyokoLover: Low-key glad Code Lyoko and Xiaolin Showdown are sticking around. They\u2019ve got that unique appeal that isn\u2019t easy to replace. But curious how long till that changes with this new \u201cSuper Duper Late Winter Lineup.\u201d If they\u2019re ushering out TTG and Scooby, who\u2019s next?\n\nAnimanga4Life: Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya coming to the block brings back fond Saturday morning memories! Although, I do get why some are skeptical; a lot of these shows have seen multiple reruns over the years.\n\nWebWader: I keep checking the website hoping it\u2019s been updated\u2026 No dice. The weird blend of old and new branding isn\u2019t helping anyone. At least update the footer to show 4Kids is steering the ship now. How hard can it be?\n\nComicStripKid: The lineup change feels like a balance between targeting the parents who grew up with these shows and trying to appeal to the new gen of cartoon fans. GoGoRiki\u2019s charm and simplicity could be their ticket into the latter\u2019s hearts. I see a mascot in the making.\n\nToonTalker91: Not thrilled about the slow pace here. It\u2019s like we\u2019re stuck in Kids WB limbo. I miss the days when a rebrand meant a fresh start, not this lingering goodbye. Curious how Gloopy and Glitter will fare with the rest of the changes looming\u2026 Will they be the last ones standing?\n\nAdmin_4KidsRevamp: Please bear with us during this transition. We\u2019re working hard to bring a fresh and exciting lineup while honoring the legacy of what came before. Believe us, it\u2019ll be worth the wait! Stay tuned for more updates and enjoy the shows in the meantime.\n\nThread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp\nWrite a follow up in mid Feb where the Feb lineup is here, 5 4Kids shows (Pokemon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby and GoGoRiki) and 5 Kids WB shows (Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter and Code Lyoko) Also, the website now has an account and points system, games, and has updated the footer to \u201c\u00a9 2024 4Kids Entertainment\u201d, Website otherwise remains the same, and still has show pages for removed shows, but this will slowly change in the coming weeks\nThread Title: CW4Kids Mid-Feb Lineup is Live!

It\u2019s a mix of eras in one block!\n\nToonMasterJay: Checked out the CW4Kids website, they finally ditched the old footer. It\u2019s official, this ship is sailing under the 4Kids flag now. Nice to see they\u2019re stepping up their game with accounts and points, plus some games to boot!\n\nAnimanga4Life: 4Kids moving in with accounts and points? Sounds like they\u2019re setting up a cool rewards system. And that might just get more kids invested in the website beyond streaming shows\u2014a savvy move.\n\nGoGoFan223: GoGoRiki getting prime time with the big 4Kids dogs is great news. Its cute factor is off the charts. Could be the one to round out the new vibe CW4Kids is going for if they play their cards right.\n\nSonicXforever: Glad to see Sonic racing into the lineup. It\u2019s about time he got back into the limelight. Now to see how he fares among the newer offerings. Talk about a speed battle!\n\nPokeNostalgia101: Pok\u00e9mon getting its rightful place has me all fired up! But it\u2019s kinda odd to still see show pages for the ousted shows on the website. Anyone else notice that? Hopefully, they\u2019ll clear that up soon.\n\nLyokoLover: The fact that Code Lyoko is sticking around amidst all the changes shows its resilience. Maybe 4Kids recognizes the gold they have with some of these Kids WB shows. The perfect yin to their yang.\n\nComicStripKid: Well, can\u2019t say 4Kids isn\u2019t taking a balanced approach to this transition. Keeping half the lineup from Kids WB seems like a strategic way to ensure they don\u2019t lose the existing audience while they woo new viewers with nostalgia and updated features.\n\nWebWader: The website is getting there, slowly but surely. With account functionality and games, it looks like 4Kids is channeling some vintage interactivity magic. Here\u2019s to mission: engage the digitally-savvy generation!\n\nToonTalker91: Seeing \u201c\u00a9 2024 4Kids Entertainment\u201d at the bottom of the website gives me mixed emotions\u2014it\u2019s good to see they\u2019re updating stuff, but the nostalgia for Kids WB is real. Any bets on how long Gloopy and Glitter can hold out?\n\nAdmin_4KidsRevamp: Thanks for sticking with us through the changes!

Plus, line-up\u2019s getting shaken up again\u2014big time!\n\nDigitalToonFan: Heard the scoop that Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, and Ultimate Spider Man are waving goodbye. But we\u2019re keeping the virtual adventures of Code Lyoko and the quirky \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d\u2014two survivors of the cull.\n\nAnimanga4Life: For the manga/anime fans, Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series is swooping in to replace the original Pok\u00e9mon series! Exciting to see some new journeys and battles. Gotta love the continuous evolution of the Pok\u00e9mon franchise on the CW4Kids.\n\nGoGoFan223: And what about that triple threat joining the fray?

The digital look update has me hyped\u2014it\u2019s like the block is leveling up. Hopefully, it adds a fresh vibe that resonates with the digital generation.\n\nPokeNostalgia101: Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series will def pull in the crowd looking for that cutting-edge anime action. Pok\u00e9mon always knows how to keep things fresh.\n\nLyokoLover: Sad to see some old friends go, but Code Lyoko holding strong gives me hope. It\u2019s like our own little slice of stability in this whirlwind of changes.\n\nComicStripKid: With the digital online style coming, CW4Kids is clearly gunning for a certain look and feel. Let\u2019s just cross our fingers it blends seamlessly with the cartoon essence we all tune in for.\n\nWebWader: Do you think bringing in Chaotic, TMNT, and Viva Pi\u00f1ata is going too far back into the vault? I\u2019m all for nostalgia, but I hope they still invest in newer properties or original content. Balance is key.\n\nToonTalker91: Big stuff with Pok\u00e9mon Horizons; it\u2019s been creating buzz all over! As for Chaotic and TMNT: Back to the Sewer, that\u2019s unexpected! Not so sure what to expect from Viva Pi\u00f1ata, though\u2026 a wildcard entry, I\u2019d say.\n\nAdmin_4KidsRevamp: Expect the unexpected with CW4Kids!

From classics like Yu-Gi-Oh! and Pok\u00e9mon, to newer hits like Sonic X and GoGoRiki, the network provided hours of entertainment for kids every weekend morning.\n\nHowever, in recent years, the CW4Kids has undergone a major rebranding and now goes by the name \"Vortexx\". While the new name may be catchier, many fans of the old CW4Kids are left wondering if the network could ever go back to its roots and bring back some of the beloved shows that made it so popular in the first place.\n\nWhile it's great that Sonic X and GoGoRiki have remained on the network, there are still plenty of fans who miss the old shows like Yu-Gi-Oh!, Pok\u00e9mon, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. These shows were not only entertaining, but they also introduced kids to a whole new world of animated storytelling and characters.\n\nWith the rise of streaming services like Netflix and Hulu, there is no shortage of options for kids to watch their favorite shows. However, there is something special about watching a show on TV on a Saturday morning, surrounded by your favorite snacks and toys.\n\nPerhaps it's time for the CW4Kids (or Vortexx) to consider bringing back some of the old shows that made it so popular in the first place. By combining the nostalgia of the past with the excitement of the present, the network could create a winning formula that appeals to fans old and new.\n\nSo, here's to hoping that the CW4Kids (or Vortexx) will one day go back to its old shows and name, while still keeping Sonic X and GoGoRiki in the mix.

It looks like Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and the head honcho Mark Pedowitz have decided to shut down the Kids WB block on CW. It seems they are handing over the reins to 4Kids Entertainment.\n\n**User2**: Wow, that's huge! Kids WB has been a staple for so long. I grew up watching Pok\u00e9mon and Yu-Gi-Oh! on there. Any idea on what prompted the change?\n\n**User3**: From what I gather, it's a strategic move. WBD probably sees more value in focusing on their streaming platforms and leaving the traditional broadcast avenue to 4Kids, which frankly, has a strong track record with kids' content.\n\n**User4**: Did anyone see what the new lineup's going to be? I\u2019m curious to see how they plan to fill the massive shoes of Kids WB.\n\n**User5**: Yeah, I saw a press release. They're kicking off the CW4Kids with some classics and some newer titles. Pok\u00e9mon, Viva Pinata, Chaotic, Sonic X, and even Smeshariki are on the list. It seems like Smeshariki might be their go-to comedy show, a bit of a departure from the Squish/Teen Titans Go!/The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers/Johnny Test mix we've gotten used to.\n\n**User6**: Smeshariki, huh? That's an interesting choice. I caught a few episodes a while back. It's definitely got a unique charm and humor to it. Could be a fresh direction for the lineup.\n\n**User7**: I'm a bit surprised Viva Pinata is making a comeback. It was such an underrated show based on the video game. Great to see it get another chance to shine.\n\n**User8**: Any word on what's going to happen with the current Kids WB shows? Are they moving to another platform or just ending?\n\n**User1**: As far as I know, some might find new life on streaming services. That's the direction most content is headed these days. But official details are sparse. We'll probably get more clarity closer to the transition.\n\n**User9**: This is certainly the end of an era but also the beginning of an exciting new chapter. The CW4Kids sounds promising, especially with the mix of nostalgia and new content. Let's hope they manage to carry on the legacy of Saturday morning cartoons successfully.\n\n**User10**: Agreed. The end of Kids WB is bittersweet, but I\u2019m optimistic about CW4Kids. The lineup sounds solid, and there\u2019s a lot of potentials to win over a new generation of fans. Plus, for those of us who are nostalgic, catching Pok\u00e9mon and Sonic X on Saturday mornings again will be a real treat."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a forum convo saying it is a Pedowitz/Zazlav co move"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**UserX**: Big news in the TV world! Mark Pedowitz and David Zaslav have pulled off what looks like a monumental shift in Saturday morning cartoons. They've decided to sunset the Kids WB block on The CW and transition the timeslot to 4Kids Entertainment. This feels like a Pedowitz/Zaslav co-maneuver through and through. Thoughts?\n\n**NostalgiaFan**: Honestly, it does scream of Pedowitz's knack for restructuring and Zaslav's push for innovation. Kids WB has been on life support for a while, with streaming platforms cannibalizing traditional TV viewership. This move could breathe new life into The CW's Saturday mornings.\n\n**CartoonConnoisseur**: Totally a strategic play by Pedowitz and Zaslav. It's sad to see Kids WB go, but the television landscape is changing. The CW4Kids, with shows like Pok\u00e9mon, Viva Pi\u00f1ata, Chaotic, Sonic X, and Smeshariki, is certainly an interesting blend of nostalgia and new content. The inclusion of Smeshariki as a comedic centerpiece is definitely a unique choice.\n\n**MediaWatcher**: It's fascinating to watch Pedowitz and Zaslav make such bold moves. This transition not only affects Warner Bros. Discovery's positioning but also reshapes the kind of content we can expect on Saturday mornings. Giving 4Kids the reigns is a clear signal that they're doubling down on kid-centric programming, which has been waning in broadcast TV.\n\n**UserY**: Makes you wonder about the future of other children's programming blocks and how this might set a precedent. Pedowitz and Zaslav are definitely making a statement here. Is this the first step towards a larger overhaul of The CW's programming strategy, or is it a one-off to salvage the Saturday morning slots?\n\n**IndustryInsider**: From what I've seen, it looks like a strategic pivot more than a one-off. Pedowitz's operations acumen and Zaslav's vast content aspirations seem to be aligning perfectly with this move. If CW4Kids can carve out a niche in the current entertainment landscape, it could be a blueprint for others to follow.\n\n**SaturdayMornFan**: Not going to lie, I'm going to miss the current line-up, but I'm curious and somewhat optimistic about CW4Kids. Pedowitz and Zaslav choosing 4Kids Entertainment as the successor is a bold move. It's a big bet on nostalgia while also trying to capture a new audience. Let's hope it pays off.\n\n**ToonTalker**: I agree that it's a bold strategy, but also a necessary evolution in how we approach kid and family entertainment on broadcast TV. Pedowitz and Zaslav are looking ahead, trying to adapt to the changing media consumption trends. CW4Kids could potentially lead the way in revitalizing Saturday morning cartoons for a new era. Fingers crossed they manage to strike the right balance between old favorites and new hits.\n\n**UserX**: Great insights, everyone. It's clear that there's a mix of apprehension and optimism regarding this transition. Only time will tell if the gamble by Pedowitz and Zaslav pays off. For now, we can only wait and see what CW4Kids has in store for us.

With #Smeshariki joining the CW4Kids lineup under 4Kids, there's been some buzz about which prefix they'll use: GoGo or Kiko. What are your thoughts? Personally, I feel the \"GoGoSmeshariki\" sounds more energetic and might attract a younger audience.\n\n**NostalgiaNerd**: That's an interesting point, ToonLover101. However, I'm leaning towards \"KikoSmeshariki.\" It feels a bit more unique and might stand out more in a crowded Saturday morning schedule. Plus, I think it retains a bit of the original charm.\n\n**CartoonCritic**: I think it depends on the direction 4Kids wants to take with the show. \"GoGoSmeshariki\" suggests more action and energy, which might align with other high-paced shows they're planning. \"KikoSmeshariki\" could indicate a more narrative-driven show. Either could work, but it's about the overall vibe they're aiming for.\n\n**SaturdaySkeptic**: Honestly, are the prefixes that big of a deal? I mean, it's the content that counts. Both \"GoGo\" and \"Kiko\" have their merits, but it's the stories, humor, and characters that will keep kids coming back each weekend. Let's not get too hung up on names.\n\n**BrandWatcher**: From a branding perspective, the choice between \"GoGo\" and \"Kiko\" could significantly influence marketability and merchandising. It sets the tone for the show's identity. \"GoGo\" might suggest more dynamic, fast-paced merchandise opportunities, while \"Kiko\" could be seen as more approachable and friendly. 4Kids' decision could reflect their long-term strategy for the show.\n\n**JuniorAnimator**: As someone aspiring to work in animation, I'm curious about how this naming decision will inform the show's visual and thematic direction. \"GoGo\" might suggest a need for more dynamic, action-packed animation sequences, whereas \"Kiko\" could allow for more creative, story-focused episodes. It's fascinating to consider how a simple prefix can influence creative direction.\n\n**ToonFanatic88**: I'm on team \"GoGoSmeshariki.\" It just rolls off the tongue better and sounds like it would be a blast to watch on a Saturday morning. Plus, it feels like it could fit well with the energetic lineup that CW4Kids is known for.\n\n**QuietViewer**: I\u2019d prefer \"KikoSmeshariki.\" It sounds softer and more inviting, which could be a nice contrast to the more action-oriented shows that usually fill the Saturday morning slots. It\u2019s essential to have variety in the lineup to cater to different viewer preferences.\n\n**ToonLover101**: These are all great points! It's clear there's no one-size-fits-all answer here, and it'll ultimately come down to what direction 4Kids wants to take the show and how they envision its place within the CW4Kids ecosystem. Either way, I'm excited to see how Smeshariki will be introduced to a new audience!"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a follow up saying we ain't getting the full name used, so it will be the prefix, with \"riki\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**ToonLover101**: Interesting update, everyone! Just saw some insider information and it looks like we're all in for a surprise. We won't be getting the full \"Smeshariki\" name used in the CW4Kids lineup. Instead, it\u2019s going to be just the prefix plus \"riki.\" Considering our debate on \"GoGo\" vs. \"Kiko,\" this is an intriguing development. Thoughts on this new direction?\n\n**NostalgiaNerd**: Wow, \"riki\" by itself? That\u2019s definitely unexpected. It could be a smart move, keeping it short and catchy for the kiddos. Though, I do wonder if the lack of the full name might cause some confusion for fans familiar with the original branding.\n\n**CartoonCritic**: That\u2019s a bold branding choice! Keeping it to either \"GoGoriki\" or \"Kikoriki\" makes it sound more like a character name than a show title. It\u2019s unique, I\u2019ll give them that. Could be memorable, which is key in the crowded kids' programming space.\n\n**SaturdaySkeptic**: I'm surprised they're going with just \"riki.\" Feels like we're losing a bit of the show\u2019s identity. But then again, branding has to evolve, and maybe this is their way of making it more appealing to today\u2019s audience. As long as the show maintains its quality, I guess the name is secondary.\n\n**BrandWatcher**: This is a fascinating case study in brand evolution. Dropping the \"Smesha\" and going with just \"riki\" paves the way for some intriguing marketing strategies. It's minimalist, and that could stand out. Plus, it leaves room for brand expansion beyond just one show if they want to build a wider \"riki\" universe.\n\n**JuniorAnimator**: This nickname approach really makes me curious about the visual branding they\u2019ll pair with it. \"GoGoriki\" or \"Kikoriki\" has a lot of potentials to be eye-catching. It could significantly influence the show\u2019s opening sequence, logo design, and overall aesthetic.\n\n**ToonFanatic88**: Honestly, I'm all for it! \"GoGoriki\" sounds like something that would immediately catch my attention. It's got a punch to it. Though, \"Kikoriki\" has a nice ring too. Can't wait to see which direction they go with and how it's received by the audience.\n\n**QuietViewer**: It\u2019s an interesting choice to focus on \"riki.\" It might make the show more mysterious to newcomers, which could be a clever way to draw them in. The simplicity of \"GoGoriki\" or \"Kikoriki\" might just make it more memorable in the long run. Looking forward to seeing how this plays out!\n\n**ToonLover101**: Great insights, as always! Whether we lean towards \"GoGo\" or \"Kiko,\" it\u2019s clear that just going with \"riki\" is a departure from the norm. It'll be fascinating to see how this plays into the show's marketing and identity.

I have a soft spot for Scooby Doo Mystery Inc. It manages to capture the essence of the original while keeping it fresh. I really hope it stays. It'd be a shame to see such a quality show get axed. \ud83d\udc3e\n\n**ActionFan88**: Batman: TBATB is a classic! It combines humor with action so well, appealing to both new and long-time Batman fans. It would be a huge mistake to pull that from the lineup.

If I had to guess, I\u2019d say Scooby Doo Mystery Inc. and Batman: TBATB might have the best chance of surviving. They\u2019re both based on iconic franchises that have stood the test of time. I\u2019d be surprised if they got cut. \n\n**ModernToonWatcher**: Sad to hear about the overhaul. Each of these shows has its own charm and fanbase. Honestly, it's hard to predict which ones will be saved. I feel like Scooby Doo and Batman might survive due to their legacy and versatility in attracting audiences across generations. Xiaolin Showdown, though amazing, might not have the same weight to stay in the competition. \ud83d\ude14\n\n**ComicBookJunkie**: If anything, Batman: TBATB NEEDS to stay. It masterfully balances between comic book lore and accessibility to new viewers. Plus, the animation and storytelling are top-notch. I would argue it\u2019s one of the best animated interpretations of Batman we\u2019ve got. \ud83d\udde8\ufe0f\ud83d\udca5\n\n**RetroToonLover**: It\u2019ll be interesting to see how Kikoriki (or GoGoRiki, whatever they decide) impacts the lineup. I\u2019m hoping network execs recognize the value of diversity in their programming. Ideally, they\u2019d keep a mixture of genres and styles, which means Scooby Doo, Batman, and Xiaolin Showdown all have a place. But who knows with networks these days. \ud83d\udcfa\ud83d\ude11\n\n**CartoonEnthusiast99**: Great points all around! It seems like there\u2019s a lot of love for all three shows.

I did love that show, but it\u2019s a bit of a genre leap from Apple and Onion. \ud83c\udf00\n\nRestInToons: RIP The Tom and Jerry Show. Kinda saw that ending coming. And to be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May? I need new cartoons, not just rewinds. But Steven Universe is still a gem, at least. \ud83d\udc8e\n\nMicrobeMania: No more Tom and Jerry? That\u2019s the end of an era. Though, to be fair, SU reruns are solid. It\u2019s not every day you get a show that tackles heavy themes with magical aliens. Still, can\u2019t help but hope we get some fresh blood in the lineup eventually.\n\nScienceRules45: True, new content is key, but at least we have Squish! And with TTG, Gumball, and Johnny Test holding the fort as flagships, I think Kids WB has a pretty balanced mix. Squish might just be the breath of fresh air we need right now.\n\nGreenJelly223: So, mid-March for Squish, that\u2019s great! Does anyone know if that\u2019s going to affect TTG, Gumball, or Johnny Test air times? I know they\u2019re the heavy hitters, just hoping Squish gets a good slot that doesn\u2019t clash.\n\nTheComicNerd21: Haven\u2019t seen anything about time changes for the flagships. I reckon Squish will find its place without much issue. Kids WB tends to do well with scheduling around their mainstays. And let\u2019s face it\u2014TTG is practically unmovable at this point.\n\nHappyMom200: My kids will be over the moon with the return of Xiaolin Showdown. I loved it as a kid, too. It\u2019s going to be a mix of new and old at our house with Squish and the reruns. I think Kids WB might just pull off this balance. Still, hoping those reruns are just placeholders for future original content.\n\nArtsyOwl: I\u2019m just happy Squish is making its debut! Sure, schedule changes are always a bit of a rollercoaster, but that\u2019s the nature of TV, right? Out with the old, in with the new\u2026 and sometimes back in with the old! \ud83d\ude02\n\nAdmin5: Friendly reminder to keep industry rumor discussions civil. Looking forward to seeing how Squish is received by the community here! Let\u2019s revisit this thread after the premiere to share our thoughts. And, as always, stay tuned for any further schedule updates from Kids WB.\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up during the summer, The summer lineup has TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, Xiaolin Showdown, Johnny Test, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons and Craig of the Creek, Also, new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek and Johnny Test return in September\nThread Title: Kids WB Summer Lineup + Fall New Episodes Info! \u2600\ufe0f\ud83d\udcfa\n\nGreenJelly223: Summer\u2019s heating up, folks, and so is Kids WB\u2019s lineup! We\u2019re looking at TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, and Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Plus, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Craig of the Creek are all part of the mix. How\u2019s everyone feeling about the current programming?\n\nCartoonAficionado: Honestly, it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag, but I\u2019m not complaining! New fans are getting a taste of some classic toons with Xiaolin Showdown, and Squish has been a pleasant surprise\u2014really nailing it. Plus, Craig of the Creek is always solid. It\u2019s like a buffet of different cartoon flavors this summer.\n\nBacteriophage_: And don\u2019t forget what\u2019s coming in the fall \u2013 new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek, and Johnny Test. September can\u2019t come soon enough!\n\nAmoebaAmy: Squish has been an absolute delight! My kids adore it, and it\u2019s turning into our little summer tradition to watch together. As much as I love TTG and Gumball, it\u2019s Squish that has us tuning in with the most excitement.\n\nTheComicNerd21: A heads-up for all the true toon fans out there: new episodes for some of these shows are usually a blast. I\u2019ve got high hopes for the fall, especially for Craig of the Creek\u2014they\u2019ve been consistently knocking it out of the park.\n\nScienceRules45: I\u2019m just glad we have such variety. Keeps the channel interesting. Summer is always tricky with kids home all day, but this lineup has something for everybody.\n\nArtsyOwl: Agreed on the variety. The blend of classic and contemporary shows has me responding like I\u2019m five and thirteen all at once. \ud83d\ude06 By the way, the art in the latest season of Looney Tunes Cartoons has been stellar. Can\u2019t wait to see what they do next.\n\nMicrobeMania: I am surprised how well Skatoony holds up. It\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but the quizzing with cartoons is unique. And with Scooby Doo and Guess Who featured, it feels like we\u2019ve got a bit of a detective theme going on. Or is it just me?\n\nRestInToons: September seems pretty far, but I got a feeling that new Teen Titans Go and Johnny Test episodes will make some serious waves. Ben 10, too, has been gearing up for something big, at least that\u2019s the vibe.\n\nHappyMom200: It\u2019s a stable lineup for sure. Steven Universe reruns are still a hit in my house. Plus, I appreciate the educational value in shows like Squish. Keeps the kids learning even out of school\u2014parents\u2019 summer dream!\n\nAdmin5: Great to see such positivity about the lineup! As always, discuss your favorite shows, but please remember no spoilers for unaired episodes. Let\u2019s reconvene in this thread when the new episodes drop in September to share our thoughts and reviews!\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up where Robotboy is added to the schedule the next year in May 2022 when Summer begins, B10, LTC and SU are leaving, Robotboy, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks are taking their place, Also in the fall, we have a few new shows, Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the bold and Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated, Also a new acquired comedy cartoon about 2 blobs\nThread Title: Kids WB Schedule Shakeup - Hello Robotboy, So Long Ben 10 & Others! \ud83e\udd16\ud83d\udcfa\n\nGreenJelly223: Hold onto your remotes, toon fans! Coming up next in May 2022, just as summer kicks off, Kids WB is adding Robotboy to the lineup. It\u2019s a nostalgia hit for sure but sad to see some good ones like Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Steven Universe leave us. Thoughts?\n\nTheComicNerd21: Man, Robotboy brings me back. Haven\u2019t seen that little guy in AGES. Sad to see Ben 10 go; it was always a solid watch. But, this is the life of a cartoon fan, right? Out with the old, in with the\u2026 older? \ud83d\ude02\n\nBacteriophage_: Robotboy\u2019s return is quite a surprise. It had that classic boy-and-his-robot vibe. Also, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks? That\u2019s quite the throwback. For those who don\u2019t remember, Chop Socky Chooks was this wild mix of kung fu and chickens\u2014only in cartoons, folks!\n\nCartoonAficionado: Don\u2019t forget about the fall bonanza! Kids WB is loading up with some heavy hitters\u2014Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated. Plus, that new comedy about two blobs? Can\u2019t find much on it, but new content is always exciting!\n\nAmoebaAmy: Wait, so we\u2019re swapping out some superhero action with\u2026 different superhero action, and we\u2019re keeping the mystery with Scooby-Doo. And do I smell a strong comedy theme building up with the two blob cartoon?\n\nRestInToons: Totally digging the superhero update with Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. They bring that comic book essence to the screen. And another comedy about blobs? Guess this one\u2019s the era of the blob, huh?\n\nArtsyOwl: As much as I\u2019ll miss Steven Universe for its depth and progressivism, I guess I\u2019m ready for something light-hearted. Robotboy and the blob comedy might just be the palate cleanser we need. Here\u2019s hoping they deliver some good laughs!\n\nMicrobeMania: Definitely a bummer about Ben 10 and SU. Those shows had such depth in storytelling and character development. But Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated is not to be slept on. That iteration has some of the best arcs for our mystery-solving gang!\n\nScienceRules45: Batman: The Brave and the Bold was a gem! It didn\u2019t take itself too seriously and had just the right amount of camp. And with Ultimate Spider-Man, looks like we\u2019ll still be getting our fix of animated superhero action.\n\nHappyMom200: Love the move to Batman and Spider-Man. My kid has been on a real superhero kick, and Scooby-Doo never gets old. At least, not in my household. The blob comedy sounds intriguing\u2014Kids WB isn\u2019t afraid to experiment, that\u2019s for sure!\n\nAdmin5: With these cartoon cycles, it\u2019s always sad to see some shows go but equally exciting to welcome new titles and welcome back some classics like Robotboy. Remember, fall is just around the corner, so let\u2019s keep the conversation going when those new shows hit the screen.\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up where the blob cartoon is revealed to (be one I made up, hopefully I make it as a YouTube series) be named \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d Gloopy is a normal slime blob wheras Glitter lives up to her name as a sparkling one, Also, a mid season show Code Lyoko is premiering just as COTC knocks off for Summer, Also promos for CSC are already airing\nThread Title: Revealed: \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d Joins Kids WB + Code Lyoko Mid-Season Premiere!\u2728\ud83e\udd16\n\nCartoonAficionado: Alright, the mystery\u2019s solved! The new blob comedy coming to Kids WB is \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d. Gloopy is your average slime blob, and Glitter is, well, super sparkly! Could be a hit if it\u2019s done well. Fingers crossed it\u2019s as fun as the name suggests.\n\nGreenJelly223: \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,\u201d huh? That\u2019s quite the name! I\u2019m all for original content\u2014bringing in some fresh \u2018slime\u2019 to the game. Kudos to the creator, especially if they started on YouTube. That\u2019s one giant leap for slime-kind. \ud83d\ude04\n\nTheComicNerd21: Between Gloopy and Glitter, I\u2019m expecting some madcap hijinks and, hopefully, some good chemistry. Pun totally intended! It\u2019s neat seeing creators move from YouTube to big networks. What a time to be alive!\n\nBacteriophage_: Just saw the promo for Chop Socky Chooks! Honestly, I\u2019d forgotten about that show, but the nostalgia hit me hard. Kids WB really knows how to draw in the old school fans alongside the new ones.\n\nAmoebaAmy: Excited to see what \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d brings to the table! It\u2019s always refreshing to see new characters and stories. Also, did anyone catch that Code Lyoko is coming back as a mid-season show? That\u2019s unexpected! I remember watching that show as a kid\u2014the blend of 2D and 3D animation was so cool.\n\nRestInToons: Code Lyoko? No way! That show was my virtual escape. With Craig of the Creek taking a summer break, Code Lyoko has some big shoes to fill. I\u2019m cautiously optimistic. Also, kudos to the person behind \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d. This is indie creators\u2019 dream!\n\nArtsyOwl: Craig of the Creek is my comfort show, so knowing it\u2019s taking a break has me in my feels. But Code Lyoko might just be the perfect summer binge to replace it. That show was ahead of its time with its virtual world storyline.\n\nMicrobeMania: With Chop Socky Chooks, Code Lyoko, and now \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,\u201d I\u2019m sensing a theme of whimsy and adventure. Perfect for a carefree summer! It\u2019s gonna be a wild ride on Kids WB.\n\nScienceRules45: Indeed, summer is shaping up to be full of adventure and laughs! I\u2019m curious to see the comedic dynamics between Gloopy and Glitter and how they\u2019ll fit into the current lineup. Code Lyoko is an excellent addition for anyone who\u2019s into that sci-fi, virtual reality vibe.\n\nHappyMom200: Just peeped the promo for Gloopy and Glitter with the kids. They\u2019re already quoting lines and chuckling. Also, major props to Kids WB for the diversity in its programming\u2014you\u2019ve got old hits, modern takes, and now a homegrown web series making it to the big leagues.\n\nAdmin5: The summer is looking quite adventurous with all the fresh and returning programming we have on our hands! If \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d or Code Lyoko capture your hearts, be sure to come back and let everyone know. Enjoy the shows, everyone, and let\u2019s support those indie creators making waves!\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up where another mid-season show premieres, replacing Gumball, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\nThread Title: Mid-Season Update: The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Replace Gumball on Kids WB! \ud83e\udd29\ud83c\udfaa\n\nTheComicNerd21: Big news for Kids WB watchers! \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d is premiering mid-season, taking the spot \u201cThe Amazing World of Gumball\u201d left behind. I\u2019ve got high hopes that these thrill-seeking siblings will bring the same level of zany to the lineup. Can they live up to the hilarity of Gumball, though? That\u2019s the big question.\n\nGreenJelly223: Gumball\u2019s out?! Say it isn\u2019t so! That show was a staple! But I remember The Adrenalini Brothers from awhile back\u2026they were full of over-the-top stunts and accents. Hopefully, they can fill the quirky cartoon void that\u2019s gonna be left in Gumball\u2019s wake.\n\nCartoonAficionado: \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d are pure comedic gold with those daredevil antics. Gumball set a high bar for humor and heart, but if you want outrageous adventures and laughs, the Adrenalinis could be just the ticket.\n\nArtsyOwl: I admit, I\u2019ll miss the random humor and clever writing of Gumball. It was one of those shows that had something for viewers of all ages. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have a different flavor, but I\u2019m definitely willing to give them a shot.\n\nBacteriophage_: Well folks, all good things must come to an end, but at least the high-paced energy of The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers might fill the void. They\u2019re not new to the cartoon scene, but let\u2019s hope their stunts are as amazing as ever.\n\nMicrobeMania: \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d is a throwback! Those guys pull off some wild stunts. Kids WB seems to be aiming for high octane to take Gumball\u2019s place. Keeping my fingers crossed that they keep delivering fresh content, even in the form of older gems getting the spotlight again.\n\nRestInToons: Guess it\u2019s goodbye to Gumball and hello Adrenalini. I remember the brothers having quite the international flair. Their eclectic style should make for a refreshing change of pace. Plus, with Squish and the others, Kids WB\u2019s variety is still on point.\n\nAmoebaAmy: My kids loved Gumball, so they\u2019re a bit gutted. But I think The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u2019 daredevil acts might just win them over. I\u2019m always down for more shenanigans. Here\u2019s hoping they get as much character-driven hilarity as Gumball had.\n\nScienceRules45: Gumball\u2019s creativity was unmatched, but The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers? That\u2019s a nostalgia trip! Will be interesting to see how a show that\u2019s been off the radar for a while resonates with the current audience.\n\nHappyMom200: My Gumball marathon nights are coming to an end it seems. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have some big shoes to fill, but I\u2019m ready for the laughs. In Kids WB we trust, right? \ud83d\ude02\n\nAdmin5: Change is part of every TV network\u2019s lifecycle. \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d could be what kids WB needs to shake things up.

Code Lyoko has secured its spot on the schedule, which I know some of you are thrilled about. The Amazing World of Gumball and Craig of the Creek are making a short-lived comeback, dipping out again in January. Can\u2019t get enough of those two, so I\u2019m here for any time they\u2019re on.\n\nCartoonAficionado: Great to have Gumball and Craig back, even if it\u2019s just for a quick hello and goodbye. It\u2019s like that favorite seasonal dish you can\u2019t stop craving. And Code Lyoko sticking around? Love that for us\u2014those virtual vibes aren\u2019t going anywhere!\n\nTheComicNerd21: Ah, the temporary returns of Gumball and Craig are bittersweet. Makes you wish they\u2019d just stick around full-time. But, I gotta say, Code Lyoko keeping its slot is A-okay with me. That\u2019s one show I\u2019ve been seriously getting back into.\n\nArtsyOwl: The quality storytelling in Craig of the Creek will be sorely missed once January rolls around. And Gumball\u2014it just has that rewatchability factor like no other. Soak it up while you can, folks!\n\nMicrobeMania: Just dropping in to say that Skatoony is going to be back next summer, and I\u2019m here for it! It\u2019s kind of become the unofficial summer tradition since 2018, hasn\u2019t it? Always great to see a show that knows how to fill its seasonal shoes.\n\nBacteriophage_: Yeah, Skatoony\u2019s like that cool summer camp you get excited about all year. But let\u2019s not overlook the fall newcomers too\u2014I\u2019m already setting reminders for Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The superhero binge is real!\n\nRestInToons: Mixed feelings about the short-term return of Gumball and Craig of the Creek. At least we know Kids WB is good at giving us something to look forward to. As for Code Lyoko, it\u2019s been interesting to see a show from yesteryear find its groove with the audience today.\n\nAmoebaAmy: The limited time with Gumball and Craig is better than no time! Let\u2019s enjoy the laughs and adventures while they last. And happy to have confirmed scoops like the one about Skatoony return\u2014it\u2019s this kind of knowledge that keeps the fandom ticking.\n\nScienceRules45: I\u2019ve gotten used to the shift and shuffle of Kids WB\u2019s schedule. You learn to appreciate what you\u2019ve got when you\u2019ve got it. That said, I\u2019m diving headfirst into the nostalgia and newness of this fall\u2019s lineup. It\u2019s going to be an entertaining season!\n\nHappyMom200: I\u2019m grateful for any sprinkles of Craig of the Creek episodes we get! It\u2019s such a gem. And does anyone else get way too competitive watching Skatoony, or is that just me? \ud83d\ude02 Super stoked about its return next year!\n\nAdmin5: Some very astute observations and a tangible excitement for the new and returning shows this fall!

As we hit the sunny stride of 2023, Kids WB is switching up the schedule. We\u2019re saying bye to Batman, Scooby, and Spidey. But don\u2019t despair\u2014Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest, and the ever-reliable Skatoony are here for those summer vibes. Also, \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d are still doing the rerun rounds. Keeping it fresh and funky!\n\nCartoonAficionado: Honestly, it\u2019s cool to see Ozzy & Drix making a comeback. That show was always under the radar but it delivered some solid laughs plus a bit of body-function education. Let\u2019s see how it holds up today!\n\nTheComicNerd21: No more Batman and Spidey is a bummer, but you know what? Bring on the Ozzy & Drix and World of Quest! I remember World of Quest being pretty out there with its humor, a good mix of action and oddball characters\u2014definitely fitting for the wacky tone of summer.\n\nMicrobeMania: Ozzy & Drix, that\u2019s a throwback! I had a feeling it could make a resurgence. Educational and entertaining\u2014that\u2019s a tough balance to strike, but that show had it. Also, cheers to year 5 of summer Skatoony\u2014it\u2019s tradition at this point!\n\nArtsyOwl: Hey, \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d are still in the reruns, too! Shimmering on\u2014quite literally, thanks to Glitter. It\u2019s a quirky and cute show, glad it\u2019s still around for the little ones to enjoy.\n\nBacteriophage_: Seeing World of Quest drop into the lineup makes me hopeful that Kids WB is dedicated to keeping variety alive. Adventure, humor, outright weirdness\u2014it\u2019s got it all. And combined with the educational fun from Ozzy & Drix, plus the game show laughs from Skatoony? Count me in for the summer!\n\nRestInToons: Sayonara superheroes! This season\u2019s lineup shows that kids\u2019 programming isn\u2019t just about capes and villains. It\u2019s about variety, surprise, and a touch of nostalgia. Let\u2019s get microscopic with Ozzy & Drix and go on a wild ride with Quest and Nestor!\n\nAmoebaAmy: Always a tad sad to see the Scooby gang go, but switching up genres keeps things interesting. Ozzy & Drix is kind of like \u201cThe Magic School Bus\u201d for the older crowd, and I\u2019m here for it! Plus, Skatoony is something my kids look forward to every year\u2014glad it\u2019s not going anywhere!\n\nScienceRules45: I\u2019ve got to say, I appreciate how Kids WB keeps mixing in educational content amidst all the comedy and action. Ozzy & Drix is a blast from the past that I\u2019m excited to revisit. It\u2019s just what we need in a world that could use a refresher on health and the human body!\n\nHappyMom200: World of Quest is an underrated treasure, and I\u2019m thrilled it\u2019s coming back into the spotlight. It\u2019s like that fun summer book series but animated. And Skatoony is practically synonymous with summer now; glad to know some things stay solid.\n\nAdmin5: The summer outlook is looking diverse and delightful! With shows that cater to every kind of young fan, there\u2019s no shortage of entertainment. Let\u2019s keep track of these changes and see how they fare in the warm months ahead.

The way they went about this was interesting, In December they started airing promos saying that from January 7 the network would be changing it\u2019s name, it didn\u2019t tell us that 4Kids are now in charge or that there would be new shows, the promo just showed the usual KWB shows like Squish, TAAB, TTG, XS, etc. Also today the promo for the next schedule change (dubbed a Super Duper Late Winter Lineup) has a new slogan \u201cYou\u2019re signed on to the CW4Kids\u201d Slow and painful rebrand? \ud83d\ude12, If you\u2019re not gonna change the bumpers untill Easter then why reveal your flashy new slogan now. Also the website (thecw4kids.com) STILL says this at the footer \u201c\u00a9 2024 Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Global, Nexstar Media Group\u201d Hopefully it is updated to reflect 4Kids\u2019s involvement soon.

The bumpers feel like Kids WB is haunting us. And they\u2019re dropping their new slogan already, but the website footer is still all about the old guard\u2026 Mixed signals much?\n\nDigitalToonFan: Yeah, the transition is definitely dragging its feet. I mean, if you\u2019re going to bring in 4Kids, then do it with a bang! Not this half-Zoom half-real-life meeting vibe. The new lineup switches could be cool though, but I\u2019ll miss Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers for sure.\n\nGoGoFan223: Honestly, I\u2019m most excited about GoGoRiki (or Smeshariki for the purists). It\u2019s cute and has that potential to be big with the comedy crowd. Less about the action and more laughs\u2014could be the perfect fit for the new direction they\u2019re aiming for.\n\nSonicXforever: Still processing the swap of Squish for Pok\u00e9mon and TAAB for Sonic X\u2026 I mean, sure, classics! But Sonic X has been rerun how many times now? I guess they\u2019re banking on that nostalgia factor to reel us in while they\u2019re redecorating.\n\nPokeNostalgia101: Not going to lie, I\u2019m excited to have Pok\u00e9mon Indigo League back\u2014it\u2019s like comfort food for my soul. But I hear you all, the change is weirdly slow. I get that it\u2019s a big shift from Kids WB to full-on 4Kids ownership, yet you\u2019d think they\u2019d want to make their mark quick.\n\nLyokoLover: Low-key glad Code Lyoko and Xiaolin Showdown are sticking around. They\u2019ve got that unique appeal that isn\u2019t easy to replace. But curious how long till that changes with this new \u201cSuper Duper Late Winter Lineup.\u201d If they\u2019re ushering out TTG and Scooby, who\u2019s next?\n\nAnimanga4Life: Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya coming to the block brings back fond Saturday morning memories! Although, I do get why some are skeptical; a lot of these shows have seen multiple reruns over the years.\n\nWebWader: I keep checking the website hoping it\u2019s been updated\u2026 No dice. The weird blend of old and new branding isn\u2019t helping anyone. At least update the footer to show 4Kids is steering the ship now. How hard can it be?\n\nComicStripKid: The lineup change feels like a balance between targeting the parents who grew up with these shows and trying to appeal to the new gen of cartoon fans. GoGoRiki\u2019s charm and simplicity could be their ticket into the latter\u2019s hearts. I see a mascot in the making.\n\nToonTalker91: Not thrilled about the slow pace here. It\u2019s like we\u2019re stuck in Kids WB limbo. I miss the days when a rebrand meant a fresh start, not this lingering goodbye. Curious how Gloopy and Glitter will fare with the rest of the changes looming\u2026 Will they be the last ones standing?\n\nAdmin_4KidsRevamp: Please bear with us during this transition. We\u2019re working hard to bring a fresh and exciting lineup while honoring the legacy of what came before. Believe us, it\u2019ll be worth the wait! Stay tuned for more updates and enjoy the shows in the meantime.\n\nThread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp\nWrite a follow up in mid Feb where the Feb lineup is here, 5 4Kids shows (Pokemon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby and GoGoRiki) and 5 Kids WB shows (Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter and Code Lyoko) Also, the website now has an account and points system, games, and has updated the footer to \u201c\u00a9 2024 4Kids Entertainment\u201d, Website otherwise remains the same, and still has show pages for removed shows, but this will slowly change in the coming weeks\nThread Title: CW4Kids Mid-Feb Lineup is Live!

Five 4Kids classics\u2014Pok\u00e9mon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby, and GoGoRiki\u2014and five Kids WB staples\u2014Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter, and Code Lyoko. It\u2019s a mix of eras in one block!\n\nToonMasterJay: Checked out the CW4Kids website, they finally ditched the old footer. It\u2019s official, this ship is sailing under the 4Kids flag now. Nice to see they\u2019re stepping up their game with accounts and points, plus some games to boot!\n\nAnimanga4Life: 4Kids moving in with accounts and points? Sounds like they\u2019re setting up a cool rewards system. And that might just get more kids invested in the website beyond streaming shows\u2014a savvy move.\n\nGoGoFan223: GoGoRiki getting prime time with the big 4Kids dogs is great news. Its cute factor is off the charts. Could be the one to round out the new vibe CW4Kids is going for if they play their cards right.\n\nSonicXforever: Glad to see Sonic racing into the lineup. It\u2019s about time he got back into the limelight. Now to see how he fares among the newer offerings. Talk about a speed battle!\n\nPokeNostalgia101: Pok\u00e9mon getting its rightful place has me all fired up! But it\u2019s kinda odd to still see show pages for the ousted shows on the website. Anyone else notice that? Hopefully, they\u2019ll clear that up soon.\n\nLyokoLover: The fact that Code Lyoko is sticking around amidst all the changes shows its resilience. Maybe 4Kids recognizes the gold they have with some of these Kids WB shows. The perfect yin to their yang.\n\nComicStripKid: Well, can\u2019t say 4Kids isn\u2019t taking a balanced approach to this transition. Keeping half the lineup from Kids WB seems like a strategic way to ensure they don\u2019t lose the existing audience while they woo new viewers with nostalgia and updated features.\n\nWebWader: The website is getting there, slowly but surely. With account functionality and games, it looks like 4Kids is channeling some vintage interactivity magic. Here\u2019s to mission: engage the digitally-savvy generation!\n\nToonTalker91: Seeing \u201c\u00a9 2024 4Kids Entertainment\u201d at the bottom of the website gives me mixed emotions\u2014it\u2019s good to see they\u2019re updating stuff, but the nostalgia for Kids WB is real. Any bets on how long Gloopy and Glitter can hold out?\n\nAdmin_4KidsRevamp: Thanks for sticking with us through the changes!

But we\u2019re keeping the virtual adventures of Code Lyoko and the quirky \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d\u2014two survivors of the cull.\n\nAnimanga4Life: For the manga/anime fans, Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series is swooping in to replace the original Pok\u00e9mon series! Exciting to see some new journeys and battles. Gotta love the continuous evolution of the Pok\u00e9mon franchise on the CW4Kids.\n\nGoGoFan223: And what about that triple threat joining the fray? Chaotic, TMNT: Back to the Sewer, and Viva Pi\u00f1ata are about to spice things up! Feels like 4Kids is tossing in as many flavors as they can to see what sticks.\n\nSonicXforever: Greatest thing about CW4Kids right now? They\u2019re not afraid to mix it up. The digital look update has me hyped\u2014it\u2019s like the block is leveling up. Hopefully, it adds a fresh vibe that resonates with the digital generation.\n\nPokeNostalgia101: Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series will def pull in the crowd looking for that cutting-edge anime action. Pok\u00e9mon always knows how to keep things fresh.\n\nLyokoLover: Sad to see some old friends go, but Code Lyoko holding strong gives me hope. It\u2019s like our own little slice of stability in this whirlwind of changes.\n\nComicStripKid: With the digital online style coming, CW4Kids is clearly gunning for a certain look and feel. Let\u2019s just cross our fingers it blends seamlessly with the cartoon essence we all tune in for.\n\nWebWader: Do you think bringing in Chaotic, TMNT, and Viva Pi\u00f1ata is going too far back into the vault? I\u2019m all for nostalgia, but I hope they still invest in newer properties or original content. Balance is key.\n\nToonTalker91: Big stuff with Pok\u00e9mon Horizons; it\u2019s been creating buzz all over! As for Chaotic and TMNT: Back to the Sewer, that\u2019s unexpected! Not so sure what to expect from Viva Pi\u00f1ata, though\u2026 a wildcard entry, I\u2019d say.\n\nAdmin_4KidsRevamp: Expect the unexpected with CW4Kids! We\u2019re committed to delivering a modern digital vibe with the shows you love, new and old.

The instrumental of \u201cChasing Cars\u201d was a touch of genius\u2014really pulled at the heartstrings. \u201cThe lab is closing after April 6,\u201d feels like the end of an era for real.\n\nDigitalToonFan: The ad was beautifully done. Gave Johnny Test the send-off it deserved, considering how long it\u2019s been a staple. It\u2019s never easy saying goodbye to beloved shows, but this ad made me feel all sorts of nostalgic.\n\nGoGoFan223: Couldn\u2019t help but shed a tear! Johnny Test has been such a constant presence. It\u2019s tough to imagine the CW4Kids without it. On a lighter note, at the end of the ad, they signposted us to two other shows: Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series and Chaotic. Looks like they\u2019re guiding us on where to shift our attention.\n\nAnimanga4Life: That signposting at the end of the ad was a smart move. Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series is generating a lot of hype already, and Chaotic has always had a dedicated fan base. Seems like CW4Kids wants to make sure that Johnny Test fans have something new to dive into.\n\nSonicXforever: Seeing that farewell ad made me reminisce about all the good times with Johnny, Dukey, and the gang. These transitions are tough, but highlighting Pok\u00e9mon Horizons and Chaotic does soften the blow. Curious how the block\u2019s vibe will change with these replacements.\n\nPokeNostalgia101: Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series as one of the signposted shows adds a refreshing adventurous spin to the lineup. It\u2019s a smart play, capturing the adventurous spirit that Johnny Test often encapsulated in its episodes.\n\nLyokoLover: The farewell ad was a class act by CW4Kids\u2014really honored the show's legacy. And pushing Horizons and Chaotic feels like we're set for some thrilling content ahead. Though I'm gonna miss Johnny's antics, it\u2019s exciting to think about what these new adventures will bring to our screens.\n\nComicStripKid: Kudos to CW4Kids for handling the transition with grace and care. The ad didn't just feel like a goodbye; it also felt like an invitation to new beginnings with Pok\u00e9mon Horizons and Chaotic. Shows strong programming foresight.\n\nWebWader: Emotional farewell aside, this move showcases CW4Kids\u2019 knack for curating engaging content that promises to fill the void Johnny Test will leave. Pok\u00e9mon Horizons and Chaotic offer different flavors, which could be exactly what we need moving forward.\n\nToonTalker91: Caught completely off-guard by that ad. It was a respectful nod to Johnny Test's impact. The focus on Pok\u00e9mon Horizons and Chaotic signals a promising and diverse direction for the block. Here's hoping they live up to the hype.\n\nAdmin_4KidsRevamp: We understand farewells are hard, especially for a show as beloved as Johnny Test.

Pretty bummed about that; was holding onto a bit of hope. They did, however, nudge us towards another show for our comedy fix. Looks like GoGoRiki is stepping up as the new comedic beacon.\n\nToonMasterJay: That\u2019s a downer about Squish. It had such a unique charm compared to anything else on the block. But I've seen a few episodes of GoGoRiki, and it's genuinely funny in its own right. If they\u2019re positioning it as the successor, it could be worth getting into.\n\nGoGoFan223: Caught that tweet too and while it's sad about Squish, I think GoGoRiki has serious potential to fill those shoes. It's different but has a lot of heart and humor. Could be the fresh start we didn't know we needed.\n\nSonicXforever: It's always tough to see favorites like Squish not making a comeback, but I've learned to trust CW4Kids' judgment over the transitions. GoGoRiki doesn't just pick up the slack; it brings something new to the table, which is always exciting.\n\nPokeNostalgia101: A bit surprised Squish isn\u2019t returning, but GoGoRiki could be the silver lining. It\u2019s got a quirky vibe that\u2019s pretty engaging. Plus, variety is the spice of life, right? Interested to see how it develops its niche within the lineup.\n\nLyokoLover: Reading \u201cSquish is not returning\u201d was a gut punch, not gonna lie. But I\u2019ve been looking for new shows to dive into, and GoGoRiki sounds like a breath of fresh air. Maybe it\u2019s exactly what CW4Kids needs right now\u2014a new comedy hero to rally behind.\n\nComicStripKid: Squish had a good run, and it\u2019s always tough to say goodbye. GoGoRiki, though, has a somewhat similar whimsy and absurdity that could resonate with fans looking for laughs. It\u2019s all about giving new shows a chance to win us over.\n\nWebWader: The Twitter announcement was a straightforward way to let fans know about Squish, albeit disappointing. Pivoting to GoGoRiki shows CW4Kids is looking ahead, trying to maintain a strong comedic lineup. It's got potential\u2014let's see how it pans out.\n\nAnimanga4Life: Was holding out hope for Squish, but GoGoRiki stepping into the limelight isn\u2019t the worst trade-off. It excels in its own style of comedy, and I think it's got the chops to become a fan favorite with some time.\n\nToonTalker91: Mix of emotions about the Squish news, but I'm curious about GoGoRiki\u2019s role in the future of CW4Kids. If they\u2019re confident enough to spotlight it as the next big comedy, I'm here for it. Excited to see where they take us next.\n\nAdmin_4KidsRevamp: Appreciate the feedback and understanding, everyone. We\u2019re sad to see Squish go but excited about the journey ahead with GoGoRiki.

CW4Kids just dropped some news regarding where fans can look forward to similar action-packed adventures. They\u2019re steering us towards \u201cWorld of Quest\u201d for our fix of martial arts, mystical items, and epic quests!\n\nDigitalToonFan: Definitely saw that coming but wasn\u2019t sure where they\u2019d redirect us. \u201cWorld of Quest\u201d has that mix of comedy and action that made Xiaolin Showdown so unique. Great to see CW4Kids is thinking about where to channel our fandom\u2019s energy.\n\nGoGoFan223: \u201cWorld of Quest\u201d has big shoes to fill, but from what I\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s more than capable. It combines humor, teamwork, and adventure in a way that should resonate well with Xiaolin Showdown fans. Looking forward to seeing how it captures our imaginations next.\n\nSonicXforever: I\u2019m all in for giving \u201cWorld of Quest\u201d a shot, especially after that recommendation. Xiaolin Showdown had a special place in my heart, not just for the action but the camaraderie and character development. Hoping \u201cWorld of Quest\u201d delivers on those fronts.\n\nPokeNostalgia101: It\u2019s a smart move. \u201cWorld of Quest\u201d taps into a very similar vibe\u2014heroes on a quest, mystical elements, and challenges that test both brains and brawn. CW4Kids is doing a good job of curating shows that keep the spirit alive.\n\nLyokoLover: Was a tad skeptical about where we\u2019d land after Xiaolin Showdown\u2019s end, but \u201cWorld of Quest\u201d looks promising. The art style and storyline appear engaging, and if it captures even half the magic of Xiaolin, we\u2019re in for a treat.\n\nComicStripKid: Transitioning from Xiaolin Showdown to \u201cWorld of Quest\u201d might just be the refresh we needed. It's always exciting to dive into new worlds, especially with shows that have a strong narrative drive and charismatic characters.\n\nWebWader: Checked out the teaser for \u201cWorld of Quest\u201d and I\u2019m intrigued. It seems like CW4Kids took their time to find a fitting successor. Xiaolin Showdown\u2019s legacy is important to many, and directing fans to a show with potential is reassuring.\n\nAnimanga4Life: While I\u2019ll miss the Shen Gong Wu hunt, \u201cWorld of Quest\u201d could spark a new interest with its adventurous quests and mystical themes. Sometimes change brings fresh classics, and I\u2019m here to see if \u201cWorld of Quest\u201d becomes one.\n\nToonTalker91: CW4Kids really seems to be putting thought into the continuity of our viewing experience. \u201cWorld of Quest\u201d as the next chapter for Xiaolin Showdown fans speaks volumes.

I just hope they keep the charm of the comics. The sense of humor in Squish is just right for a cartoon!\n\nScienceRules45: @MicrobeMania I read that the team behind some of the recent popular cartoons is on board for this. As for voice actors, nothing\u2019s announced yet. I\u2019m crossing my fingers they get some quality talent. Hoping for some great chemistry between Squish, Pod, and Peggy. \ud83e\udd1e\n\nTheComicNerd21: True, voice acting can make or break a cartoon adaptation. I\u2019m a bit skeptical, tbh. Sometimes these transitions lose the spirit of the original material. But I\u2019ll reserve judgment until we get a trailer or something.\n\nArtsyOwl: Has anyone heard about the art style yet? The simplistic yet expressive style of the books is super charming. Kids WB tends to go for flashier animation, though I hope they keep it close to the spirit of the Squish comics.\n\nHappyMom200: I just hope they tackle the educational aspects well. My kids learned so much about microorganisms from these books while laughing their heads off. It\u2019ll be great for them to watch Squish\u2019s adventures!\n\nBioGeek: Yes! Education through entertainment is the best. I mean, who knew an amoeba could make science this fun? \ud83d\ude05 And considering we\u2019ve all become amateur virologists lately (thanks, 2020), the timing couldn\u2019t be better.\n\nGreenJelly223: For sure, @BioGeek. They have a chance here to really create something that\u2019s as informational as it is entertaining. I also love how the books touch on themes of friendship and acceptance.

I\u2019m totally having a viewing party with my kids. But wow, Apple and Onion out for Xiaolin Showdown\u2026nostalgia trip, anyone? I did love that show, but it\u2019s a bit of a genre leap from Apple and Onion. \ud83c\udf00\n\nRestInToons: RIP The Tom and Jerry Show. Kinda saw that ending coming. And to be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May? I need new cartoons, not just rewinds. But Steven Universe is still a gem, at least. \ud83d\udc8e\n\nMicrobeMania: No more Tom and Jerry? That\u2019s the end of an era. Though, to be fair, SU reruns are solid. It\u2019s not every day you get a show that tackles heavy themes with magical aliens. Still, can\u2019t help but hope we get some fresh blood in the lineup eventually.\n\nScienceRules45: True, new content is key, but at least we have Squish! And with TTG, Gumball, and Johnny Test holding the fort as flagships, I think Kids WB has a pretty balanced mix. Squish might just be the breath of fresh air we need right now.\n\nGreenJelly223: So, mid-March for Squish, that\u2019s great! Does anyone know if that\u2019s going to affect TTG, Gumball, or Johnny Test air times? I know they\u2019re the heavy hitters, just hoping Squish gets a good slot that doesn\u2019t clash.\n\nTheComicNerd21: Haven\u2019t seen anything about time changes for the flagships. I reckon Squish will find its place without much issue. Kids WB tends to do well with scheduling around their mainstays. And let\u2019s face it\u2014TTG is practically unmovable at this point.\n\nHappyMom200: My kids will be over the moon with the return of Xiaolin Showdown. I loved it as a kid, too. It\u2019s going to be a mix of new and old at our house with Squish and the reruns. I think Kids WB might just pull off this balance. Still, hoping those reruns are just placeholders for future original content.\n\nArtsyOwl: I\u2019m just happy Squish is making its debut! Sure, schedule changes are always a bit of a rollercoaster, but that\u2019s the nature of TV, right? Out with the old, in with the new\u2026 and sometimes back in with the old! \ud83d\ude02\n\nAdmin5: Friendly reminder to keep industry rumor discussions civil. Looking forward to seeing how Squish is received by the community here! Let\u2019s revisit this thread after the premiere to share our thoughts. And, as always, stay tuned for any further schedule updates from Kids WB.\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up during the summer, The summer lineup has TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, Xiaolin Showdown, Johnny Test, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons and Craig of the Creek, Also, new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek and Johnny Test return in September\nThread Title: Kids WB Summer Lineup + Fall New Episodes Info! \u2600\ufe0f\ud83d\udcfa\n\nGreenJelly223: Summer\u2019s heating up, folks, and so is Kids WB\u2019s lineup! We\u2019re looking at TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, and Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Plus, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Craig of the Creek are all part of the mix. How\u2019s everyone feeling about the current programming?\n\nCartoonAficionado: Honestly, it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag, but I\u2019m not complaining! New fans are getting a taste of some classic toons with Xiaolin Showdown, and Squish has been a pleasant surprise\u2014really nailing it. Plus, Craig of the Creek is always solid. It\u2019s like a buffet of different cartoon flavors this summer.\n\nBacteriophage_: And don\u2019t forget what\u2019s coming in the fall \u2013 new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek, and Johnny Test. September can\u2019t come soon enough!\n\nAmoebaAmy: Squish has been an absolute delight! My kids adore it, and it\u2019s turning into our little summer tradition to watch together. As much as I love TTG and Gumball, it\u2019s Squish that has us tuning in with the most excitement.\n\nTheComicNerd21: A heads-up for all the true toon fans out there: new episodes for some of these shows are usually a blast. I\u2019ve got high hopes for the fall, especially for Craig of the Creek\u2014they\u2019ve been consistently knocking it out of the park.\n\nScienceRules45: I\u2019m just glad we have such variety. Keeps the channel interesting. Summer is always tricky with kids home all day, but this lineup has something for everybody.\n\nArtsyOwl: Agreed on the variety. The blend of classic and contemporary shows has me responding like I\u2019m five and thirteen all at once. \ud83d\ude06 By the way, the art in the latest season of Looney Tunes Cartoons has been stellar. Can\u2019t wait to see what they do next.\n\nMicrobeMania: I am surprised how well Skatoony holds up. It\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but the quizzing with cartoons is unique. And with Scooby Doo and Guess Who featured, it feels like we\u2019ve got a bit of a detective theme going on. Or is it just me?\n\nRestInToons: September seems pretty far, but I got a feeling that new Teen Titans Go and Johnny Test episodes will make some serious waves. Ben 10, too, has been gearing up for something big, at least that\u2019s the vibe.\n\nHappyMom200: It\u2019s a stable lineup for sure. Steven Universe reruns are still a hit in my house. Plus, I appreciate the educational value in shows like Squish. Keeps the kids learning even out of school\u2014parents\u2019 summer dream!\n\nAdmin5: Great to see such positivity about the lineup! As always, discuss your favorite shows, but please remember no spoilers for unaired episodes. Let\u2019s reconvene in this thread when the new episodes drop in September to share our thoughts and reviews!\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up where Robotboy is added to the schedule the next year in May 2022 when Summer begins, B10, LTC and SU are leaving, Robotboy, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks are taking their place, Also in the fall, we have a few new shows, Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the bold and Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated, Also a new acquired comedy cartoon about 2 blobs\nThread Title: Kids WB Schedule Shakeup - Hello Robotboy, So Long Ben 10 & Others! \ud83e\udd16\ud83d\udcfa\n\nGreenJelly223: Hold onto your remotes, toon fans! Coming up next in May 2022, just as summer kicks off, Kids WB is adding Robotboy to the lineup. It\u2019s a nostalgia hit for sure but sad to see some good ones like Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Steven Universe leave us. Thoughts?\n\nTheComicNerd21: Man, Robotboy brings me back. Haven\u2019t seen that little guy in AGES. Sad to see Ben 10 go; it was always a solid watch. But, this is the life of a cartoon fan, right? Out with the old, in with the\u2026 older? \ud83d\ude02\n\nBacteriophage_: Robotboy\u2019s return is quite a surprise. It had that classic boy-and-his-robot vibe. Also, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks? That\u2019s quite the throwback. For those who don\u2019t remember, Chop Socky Chooks was this wild mix of kung fu and chickens\u2014only in cartoons, folks!\n\nCartoonAficionado: Don\u2019t forget about the fall bonanza! Kids WB is loading up with some heavy hitters\u2014Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated. Plus, that new comedy about two blobs? Can\u2019t find much on it, but new content is always exciting!\n\nAmoebaAmy: Wait, so we\u2019re swapping out some superhero action with\u2026 different superhero action, and we\u2019re keeping the mystery with Scooby-Doo. And do I smell a strong comedy theme building up with the two blob cartoon?\n\nRestInToons: Totally digging the superhero update with Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. They bring that comic book essence to the screen. And another comedy about blobs? Guess this one\u2019s the era of the blob, huh?\n\nArtsyOwl: As much as I\u2019ll miss Steven Universe for its depth and progressivism, I guess I\u2019m ready for something light-hearted. Robotboy and the blob comedy might just be the palate cleanser we need. Here\u2019s hoping they deliver some good laughs!\n\nMicrobeMania: Definitely a bummer about Ben 10 and SU. Those shows had such depth in storytelling and character development. But Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated is not to be slept on. That iteration has some of the best arcs for our mystery-solving gang!\n\nScienceRules45: Batman: The Brave and the Bold was a gem! It didn\u2019t take itself too seriously and had just the right amount of camp. And with Ultimate Spider-Man, looks like we\u2019ll still be getting our fix of animated superhero action.\n\nHappyMom200: Love the move to Batman and Spider-Man. My kid has been on a real superhero kick, and Scooby-Doo never gets old. At least, not in my household. The blob comedy sounds intriguing\u2014Kids WB isn\u2019t afraid to experiment, that\u2019s for sure!\n\nAdmin5: With these cartoon cycles, it\u2019s always sad to see some shows go but equally exciting to welcome new titles and welcome back some classics like Robotboy. Remember, fall is just around the corner, so let\u2019s keep the conversation going when those new shows hit the screen.\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up where the blob cartoon is revealed to (be one I made up, hopefully I make it as a YouTube series) be named \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d Gloopy is a normal slime blob wheras Glitter lives up to her name as a sparkling one, Also, a mid season show Code Lyoko is premiering just as COTC knocks off for Summer, Also promos for CSC are already airing\nThread Title: Revealed: \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d Joins Kids WB + Code Lyoko Mid-Season Premiere!\u2728\ud83e\udd16\n\nCartoonAficionado: Alright, the mystery\u2019s solved! The new blob comedy coming to Kids WB is \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d. Gloopy is your average slime blob, and Glitter is, well, super sparkly! Could be a hit if it\u2019s done well. Fingers crossed it\u2019s as fun as the name suggests.\n\nGreenJelly223: \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,\u201d huh? That\u2019s quite the name! I\u2019m all for original content\u2014bringing in some fresh \u2018slime\u2019 to the game. Kudos to the creator, especially if they started on YouTube. That\u2019s one giant leap for slime-kind. \ud83d\ude04\n\nTheComicNerd21: Between Gloopy and Glitter, I\u2019m expecting some madcap hijinks and, hopefully, some good chemistry. Pun totally intended! It\u2019s neat seeing creators move from YouTube to big networks. What a time to be alive!\n\nBacteriophage_: Just saw the promo for Chop Socky Chooks! Honestly, I\u2019d forgotten about that show, but the nostalgia hit me hard. Kids WB really knows how to draw in the old school fans alongside the new ones.\n\nAmoebaAmy: Excited to see what \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d brings to the table! It\u2019s always refreshing to see new characters and stories. Also, did anyone catch that Code Lyoko is coming back as a mid-season show? That\u2019s unexpected! I remember watching that show as a kid\u2014the blend of 2D and 3D animation was so cool.\n\nRestInToons: Code Lyoko? No way! That show was my virtual escape. With Craig of the Creek taking a summer break, Code Lyoko has some big shoes to fill. I\u2019m cautiously optimistic. Also, kudos to the person behind \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d. This is indie creators\u2019 dream!\n\nArtsyOwl: Craig of the Creek is my comfort show, so knowing it\u2019s taking a break has me in my feels. But Code Lyoko might just be the perfect summer binge to replace it. That show was ahead of its time with its virtual world storyline.\n\nMicrobeMania: With Chop Socky Chooks, Code Lyoko, and now \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,\u201d I\u2019m sensing a theme of whimsy and adventure. Perfect for a carefree summer! It\u2019s gonna be a wild ride on Kids WB.\n\nScienceRules45: Indeed, summer is shaping up to be full of adventure and laughs! I\u2019m curious to see the comedic dynamics between Gloopy and Glitter and how they\u2019ll fit into the current lineup. Code Lyoko is an excellent addition for anyone who\u2019s into that sci-fi, virtual reality vibe.\n\nHappyMom200: Just peeped the promo for Gloopy and Glitter with the kids. They\u2019re already quoting lines and chuckling. Also, major props to Kids WB for the diversity in its programming\u2014you\u2019ve got old hits, modern takes, and now a homegrown web series making it to the big leagues.\n\nAdmin5: The summer is looking quite adventurous with all the fresh and returning programming we have on our hands! If \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d or Code Lyoko capture your hearts, be sure to come back and let everyone know. Enjoy the shows, everyone, and let\u2019s support those indie creators making waves!\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up where another mid-season show premieres, replacing Gumball, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\nThread Title: Mid-Season Update: The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Replace Gumball on Kids WB! \ud83e\udd29\ud83c\udfaa\n\nTheComicNerd21: Big news for Kids WB watchers! \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d is premiering mid-season, taking the spot \u201cThe Amazing World of Gumball\u201d left behind. I\u2019ve got high hopes that these thrill-seeking siblings will bring the same level of zany to the lineup. Can they live up to the hilarity of Gumball, though? That\u2019s the big question.\n\nGreenJelly223: Gumball\u2019s out?! Say it isn\u2019t so! That show was a staple! But I remember The Adrenalini Brothers from awhile back\u2026they were full of over-the-top stunts and accents. Hopefully, they can fill the quirky cartoon void that\u2019s gonna be left in Gumball\u2019s wake.\n\nCartoonAficionado: \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d are pure comedic gold with those daredevil antics. Gumball set a high bar for humor and heart, but if you want outrageous adventures and laughs, the Adrenalinis could be just the ticket.\n\nArtsyOwl: I admit, I\u2019ll miss the random humor and clever writing of Gumball. It was one of those shows that had something for viewers of all ages. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have a different flavor, but I\u2019m definitely willing to give them a shot.\n\nBacteriophage_: Well folks, all good things must come to an end, but at least the high-paced energy of The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers might fill the void. They\u2019re not new to the cartoon scene, but let\u2019s hope their stunts are as amazing as ever.\n\nMicrobeMania: \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d is a throwback! Those guys pull off some wild stunts. Kids WB seems to be aiming for high octane to take Gumball\u2019s place. Keeping my fingers crossed that they keep delivering fresh content, even in the form of older gems getting the spotlight again.\n\nRestInToons: Guess it\u2019s goodbye to Gumball and hello Adrenalini. I remember the brothers having quite the international flair. Their eclectic style should make for a refreshing change of pace. Plus, with Squish and the others, Kids WB\u2019s variety is still on point.\n\nAmoebaAmy: My kids loved Gumball, so they\u2019re a bit gutted. But I think The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u2019 daredevil acts might just win them over. I\u2019m always down for more shenanigans. Here\u2019s hoping they get as much character-driven hilarity as Gumball had.\n\nScienceRules45: Gumball\u2019s creativity was unmatched, but The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers? That\u2019s a nostalgia trip! Will be interesting to see how a show that\u2019s been off the radar for a while resonates with the current audience.\n\nHappyMom200: My Gumball marathon nights are coming to an end it seems. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have some big shoes to fill, but I\u2019m ready for the laughs. In Kids WB we trust, right? \ud83d\ude02\n\nAdmin5: Change is part of every TV network\u2019s lifecycle. \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d could be what kids WB needs to shake things up.

Code Lyoko has secured its spot on the schedule, which I know some of you are thrilled about. The Amazing World of Gumball and Craig of the Creek are making a short-lived comeback, dipping out again in January. Can\u2019t get enough of those two, so I\u2019m here for any time they\u2019re on.\n\nCartoonAficionado: Great to have Gumball and Craig back, even if it\u2019s just for a quick hello and goodbye. It\u2019s like that favorite seasonal dish you can\u2019t stop craving. And Code Lyoko sticking around? Love that for us\u2014those virtual vibes aren\u2019t going anywhere!\n\nTheComicNerd21: Ah, the temporary returns of Gumball and Craig are bittersweet. Makes you wish they\u2019d just stick around full-time. But, I gotta say, Code Lyoko keeping its slot is A-okay with me. That\u2019s one show I\u2019ve been seriously getting back into.\n\nArtsyOwl: The quality storytelling in Craig of the Creek will be sorely missed once January rolls around. And Gumball\u2014it just has that rewatchability factor like no other. Soak it up while you can, folks!\n\nMicrobeMania: Just dropping in to say that Skatoony is going to be back next summer, and I\u2019m here for it! It\u2019s kind of become the unofficial summer tradition since 2018, hasn\u2019t it? Always great to see a show that knows how to fill its seasonal shoes.\n\nBacteriophage_: Yeah, Skatoony\u2019s like that cool summer camp you get excited about all year. But let\u2019s not overlook the fall newcomers too\u2014I\u2019m already setting reminders for Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The superhero binge is real!\n\nRestInToons: Mixed feelings about the short-term return of Gumball and Craig of the Creek. At least we know Kids WB is good at giving us something to look forward to. As for Code Lyoko, it\u2019s been interesting to see a show from yesteryear find its groove with the audience today.\n\nAmoebaAmy: The limited time with Gumball and Craig is better than no time! Let\u2019s enjoy the laughs and adventures while they last. And happy to have confirmed scoops like the one about Skatoony return\u2014it\u2019s this kind of knowledge that keeps the fandom ticking.\n\nScienceRules45: I\u2019ve gotten used to the shift and shuffle of Kids WB\u2019s schedule. You learn to appreciate what you\u2019ve got when you\u2019ve got it. That said, I\u2019m diving headfirst into the nostalgia and newness of this fall\u2019s lineup. It\u2019s going to be an entertaining season!\n\nHappyMom200: I\u2019m grateful for any sprinkles of Craig of the Creek episodes we get! It\u2019s such a gem. And does anyone else get way too competitive watching Skatoony, or is that just me? \ud83d\ude02 Super stoked about its return next year!\n\nAdmin5: Some very astute observations and a tangible excitement for the new and returning shows this fall!

But don\u2019t despair\u2014Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest, and the ever-reliable Skatoony are here for those summer vibes. Also, \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d are still doing the rerun rounds. Keeping it fresh and funky!\n\nCartoonAficionado: Honestly, it\u2019s cool to see Ozzy & Drix making a comeback. That show was always under the radar but it delivered some solid laughs plus a bit of body-function education. Let\u2019s see how it holds up today!\n\nTheComicNerd21: No more Batman and Spidey is a bummer, but you know what? Bring on the Ozzy & Drix and World of Quest! I remember World of Quest being pretty out there with its humor, a good mix of action and oddball characters\u2014definitely fitting for the wacky tone of summer.\n\nMicrobeMania: Ozzy & Drix, that\u2019s a throwback! I had a feeling it could make a resurgence. Educational and entertaining\u2014that\u2019s a tough balance to strike, but that show had it. Also, cheers to year 5 of summer Skatoony\u2014it\u2019s tradition at this point!\n\nArtsyOwl: Hey, \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d are still in the reruns, too! Shimmering on\u2014quite literally, thanks to Glitter. It\u2019s a quirky and cute show, glad it\u2019s still around for the little ones to enjoy.\n\nBacteriophage_: Seeing World of Quest drop into the lineup makes me hopeful that Kids WB is dedicated to keeping variety alive. Adventure, humor, outright weirdness\u2014it\u2019s got it all. And combined with the educational fun from Ozzy & Drix, plus the game show laughs from Skatoony? Count me in for the summer!\n\nRestInToons: Sayonara superheroes! This season\u2019s lineup shows that kids\u2019 programming isn\u2019t just about capes and villains. It\u2019s about variety, surprise, and a touch of nostalgia. Let\u2019s get microscopic with Ozzy & Drix and go on a wild ride with Quest and Nestor!\n\nAmoebaAmy: Always a tad sad to see the Scooby gang go, but switching up genres keeps things interesting. Ozzy & Drix is kind of like \u201cThe Magic School Bus\u201d for the older crowd, and I\u2019m here for it! Plus, Skatoony is something my kids look forward to every year\u2014glad it\u2019s not going anywhere!\n\nScienceRules45: I\u2019ve got to say, I appreciate how Kids WB keeps mixing in educational content amidst all the comedy and action. Ozzy & Drix is a blast from the past that I\u2019m excited to revisit. It\u2019s just what we need in a world that could use a refresher on health and the human body!\n\nHappyMom200: World of Quest is an underrated treasure, and I\u2019m thrilled it\u2019s coming back into the spotlight. It\u2019s like that fun summer book series but animated. And Skatoony is practically synonymous with summer now; glad to know some things stay solid.\n\nAdmin5: The summer outlook is looking diverse and delightful!

The way they went about this was interesting, In December they started airing promos saying that from January 7 the network would be changing it\u2019s name, it didn\u2019t tell us that 4Kids are now in charge or that there would be new shows, the promo just showed the usual KWB shows like Squish, TAAB, TTG, XS, etc. Also today the promo for the next schedule change (dubbed a Super Duper Late Winter Lineup) has a new slogan \u201cYou\u2019re signed on to the CW4Kids\u201d Slow and painful rebrand? \ud83d\ude12, If you\u2019re not gonna change the bumpers untill Easter then why reveal your flashy new slogan now. Also the website (thecw4kids.com) STILL says this at the footer \u201c\u00a9 2024 Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Global, Nexstar Media Group\u201d Hopefully it is updated to reflect 4Kids\u2019s involvement soon.

The bumpers feel like Kids WB is haunting us. And they\u2019re dropping their new slogan already, but the website footer is still all about the old guard\u2026 Mixed signals much?\n\nDigitalToonFan: Yeah, the transition is definitely dragging its feet. I mean, if you\u2019re going to bring in 4Kids, then do it with a bang! Not this half-Zoom half-real-life meeting vibe. The new lineup switches could be cool though, but I\u2019ll miss Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers for sure.\n\nGoGoFan223: Honestly, I\u2019m most excited about GoGoRiki (or Smeshariki for the purists). It\u2019s cute and has that potential to be big with the comedy crowd. Less about the action and more laughs\u2014could be the perfect fit for the new direction they\u2019re aiming for.\n\nSonicXforever: Still processing the swap of Squish for Pok\u00e9mon and TAAB for Sonic X\u2026 I mean, sure, classics! But Sonic X has been rerun how many times now? I guess they\u2019re banking on that nostalgia factor to reel us in while they\u2019re redecorating.\n\nPokeNostalgia101: Not going to lie, I\u2019m excited to have Pok\u00e9mon Indigo League back\u2014it\u2019s like comfort food for my soul. But I hear you all, the change is weirdly slow. I get that it\u2019s a big shift from Kids WB to full-on 4Kids ownership, yet you\u2019d think they\u2019d want to make their mark quick.\n\nLyokoLover: Low-key glad Code Lyoko and Xiaolin Showdown are sticking around. They\u2019ve got that unique appeal that isn\u2019t easy to replace. But curious how long till that changes with this new \u201cSuper Duper Late Winter Lineup.\u201d If they\u2019re ushering out TTG and Scooby, who\u2019s next?\n\nAnimanga4Life: Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya coming to the block brings back fond Saturday morning memories! Although, I do get why some are skeptical; a lot of these shows have seen multiple reruns over the years.\n\nWebWader: I keep checking the website hoping it\u2019s been updated\u2026 No dice. The weird blend of old and new branding isn\u2019t helping anyone. At least update the footer to show 4Kids is steering the ship now. How hard can it be?\n\nComicStripKid: The lineup change feels like a balance between targeting the parents who grew up with these shows and trying to appeal to the new gen of cartoon fans. GoGoRiki\u2019s charm and simplicity could be their ticket into the latter\u2019s hearts. I see a mascot in the making.\n\nToonTalker91: Not thrilled about the slow pace here. It\u2019s like we\u2019re stuck in Kids WB limbo. I miss the days when a rebrand meant a fresh start, not this lingering goodbye. Curious how Gloopy and Glitter will fare with the rest of the changes looming\u2026 Will they be the last ones standing?\n\nAdmin_4KidsRevamp: Please bear with us during this transition. We\u2019re working hard to bring a fresh and exciting lineup while honoring the legacy of what came before. Believe us, it\u2019ll be worth the wait!

Five 4Kids classics\u2014Pok\u00e9mon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby, and GoGoRiki\u2014and five Kids WB staples\u2014Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter, and Code Lyoko. It\u2019s a mix of eras in one block!\n\nToonMasterJay: Checked out the CW4Kids website, they finally ditched the old footer. It\u2019s official, this ship is sailing under the 4Kids flag now. Nice to see they\u2019re stepping up their game with accounts and points, plus some games to boot!\n\nAnimanga4Life: 4Kids moving in with accounts and points? Sounds like they\u2019re setting up a cool rewards system. And that might just get more kids invested in the website beyond streaming shows\u2014a savvy move.\n\nGoGoFan223: GoGoRiki getting prime time with the big 4Kids dogs is great news. Its cute factor is off the charts. Could be the one to round out the new vibe CW4Kids is going for if they play their cards right.\n\nSonicXforever: Glad to see Sonic racing into the lineup. It\u2019s about time he got back into the limelight. Now to see how he fares among the newer offerings. Talk about a speed battle!\n\nPokeNostalgia101: Pok\u00e9mon getting its rightful place has me all fired up! But it\u2019s kinda odd to still see show pages for the ousted shows on the website. Anyone else notice that? Hopefully, they\u2019ll clear that up soon.\n\nLyokoLover: The fact that Code Lyoko is sticking around amidst all the changes shows its resilience. Maybe 4Kids recognizes the gold they have with some of these Kids WB shows. The perfect yin to their yang.\n\nComicStripKid: Well, can\u2019t say 4Kids isn\u2019t taking a balanced approach to this transition. Keeping half the lineup from Kids WB seems like a strategic way to ensure they don\u2019t lose the existing audience while they woo new viewers with nostalgia and updated features.\n\nWebWader: The website is getting there, slowly but surely. With account functionality and games, it looks like 4Kids is channeling some vintage interactivity magic. Here\u2019s to mission: engage the digitally-savvy generation!\n\nToonTalker91: Seeing \u201c\u00a9 2024 4Kids Entertainment\u201d at the bottom of the website gives me mixed emotions\u2014it\u2019s good to see they\u2019re updating stuff, but the nostalgia for Kids WB is real. Any bets on how long Gloopy and Glitter can hold out?\n\nAdmin_4KidsRevamp: Thanks for sticking with us through the changes!

But we\u2019re keeping the virtual adventures of Code Lyoko and the quirky \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d\u2014two survivors of the cull.\n\nAnimanga4Life: For the manga/anime fans, Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series is swooping in to replace the original Pok\u00e9mon series! Exciting to see some new journeys and battles. Gotta love the continuous evolution of the Pok\u00e9mon franchise on the CW4Kids.\n\nGoGoFan223: And what about that triple threat joining the fray? Chaotic, TMNT: Back to the Sewer, and Viva Pi\u00f1ata are about to spice things up!

The digital look update has me hyped\u2014it\u2019s like the block is leveling up. Hopefully, it adds a fresh vibe that resonates with the digital generation.\n\nPokeNostalgia101: Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series will def pull in the crowd looking for that cutting-edge anime action. Pok\u00e9mon always knows how to keep things fresh.\n\nLyokoLover: Sad to see some old friends go, but Code Lyoko holding strong gives me hope. It\u2019s like our own little slice of stability in this whirlwind of changes.\n\nComicStripKid: With the digital online style coming, CW4Kids is clearly gunning for a certain look and feel. Let\u2019s just cross our fingers it blends seamlessly with the cartoon essence we all tune in for.\n\nWebWader: Do you think bringing in Chaotic, TMNT, and Viva Pi\u00f1ata is going too far back into the vault? I\u2019m all for nostalgia, but I hope they still invest in newer properties or original content. Balance is key.\n\nToonTalker91: Big stuff with Pok\u00e9mon Horizons; it\u2019s been creating buzz all over! As for Chaotic and TMNT: Back to the Sewer, that\u2019s unexpected! Not so sure what to expect from Viva Pi\u00f1ata, though\u2026 a wildcard entry, I\u2019d say.\n\nAdmin_4KidsRevamp: Expect the unexpected with CW4Kids!

It was a well-done farewell, giving us all a heads up to start exploring the rest of the CW4Kids landscape. End of an era, but change is part of the toon world, right?\n\nDigitalToonFan: Yeah, that ad hit me harder than I thought it would. Johnny Test was always such a staple. It\u2019s like saying goodbye to an old friend. But hey, the future\u2019s bright with so many new options to dive into!\n\nGoGoFan223: CW4Kids did Johnny Test justice with that farewell.

While it\u2019s sad to see Johnny Test go, I\u2019m kinda thrilled about TMNT: Back to the Sewer. There\u2019s something about heroes and action that fills the void nicely.\n\nPokeNostalgia101: That promo was a classy move. Now, Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series is shaping up to be my next obsession. Pok\u00e9mon always manages to keep the spirit of adventure high, so it\u2019s a smooth transition.\n\nLyokoLover: The end of Johnny Test marks a moment of true change for CW4Kids. As much as I\u2019ll miss it, I\u2019m grateful we still have the gripping tales of Code Lyoko. It's shows like these that remind us why we love animation\u2014constant evolution and creativity.\n\nComicStripKid: It was a touching send-off for Johnny Test. As viewers start to embrace shows like Viva Pi\u00f1ata, I\u2019m curious to see if it can capture the hearts of longtime fans with its unique charm and colorful world.\n\nWebWader: \u201cThe lab is closing soon\u201d ad was a respectful nod to departing icons and a gentle nudge for us to keep exploring. Kudos to CW4Kids for handling it with care. The lineup\u2019s refresh has me leaning into Chaotic\u2014something about the strategic gameplay and fantasy world catches my eye.\n\nToonTalker91: Farewell, Johnny Test.

For Xiaolin Showdown fans, they're suggesting a jump to \"Legend Quest\" and \"Magi-Nation.\" Both seem to carry that adventurous spirit and mix of humor and action we loved. Has anyone checked these out yet?\n\nComicFan101: As an Ultimate Spider-Man fan, the transition seems pointed towards \"Young Justice\" and \"The Spectacular Spider-Man\" reruns on another network. Not the same, but still superhero themed with tight storylines and character development. \n\nAnimeArcher: For a bit of that culture blend and fighting spirit from Xiaolin Showdown, \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" is also a fantastic migration option. It's not a new suggestion, but it's timeless in how it handles teamwork and mystical elements.\n\nPixelPete: Anybody here think \"Dragon Ball\" series might be a good fit too? The mix of martial arts, adventure, and that never-give-up attitude really vibes with what Xiaolin Showdown offered. Lots of episodes to binge!\n\nWebSlingerFan: Yeah, \"The Spectacular Spider-Man\" has been fantastic in capturing the essence of Spidey. It\u2019s got that balance of personal life and superhero drama. Meanwhile, \"Young Justice\" gives us that team dynamic fix similar to what we had with Ultimate Spider-Man, but with a slightly more serious tone.\n\nMysticWind: Just to add a wild card here, but \"Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir\" has been my go-to for quirky heroes and humorous adventures post-Xiaolin. It's surprisingly captivating with a magical charm similar to what drew me to Xiaolin in the first place.\n\nHeroicEcho: Don\u2019t forget about \"Teen Titans\" for the Ultimate Spider-Man fans! It\u2019s a bit older, but the character dynamics, humor, and battles are top-notch. Plus, the camaraderie within the team gives off similar vibes to Peter Parker and his interactions with his superhero counterparts.\n\nShaolinMaster88: Great suggestions all around! It's reassuring to see there are plenty of options out there to fill the void. Each recommendation captures a bit of what made Xiaolin Showdown and Ultimate Spider-Man special to us.

There\u2019s a Squish cartoon in the works and it\u2019s hitting Kids WB\u2019s mid-season lineup! Can\u2019t wait to see our favorite amoeba make the jump from page to screen! \ud83d\ude04\n\nMicrobeMania: No way, this is awesome! Squish has been one of my favorite graphic novel series for my kids. They\u2019re going to freak out! Have they announced who\u2019s behind the animation or any voice actors yet?\n\nAmoebaAmy: OMG, this made my day! I stumbled onto the news on Twitter but wasn\u2019t sure if it was real. I just hope they keep the charm of the comics. The sense of humor in Squish is just right for a cartoon!\n\nScienceRules45: @MicrobeMania I read that the team behind some of the recent popular cartoons is on board for this. As for voice actors, nothing\u2019s announced yet. I\u2019m crossing my fingers they get some quality talent. Hoping for some great chemistry between Squish, Pod, and Peggy. \ud83e\udd1e\n\nTheComicNerd21: True, voice acting can make or break a cartoon adaptation. I\u2019m a bit skeptical, tbh. Sometimes these transitions lose the spirit of the original material. But I\u2019ll reserve judgment until we get a trailer or something.\n\nArtsyOwl: Has anyone heard about the art style yet? The simplistic yet expressive style of the books is super charming. Kids WB tends to go for flashier animation, though I hope they keep it close to the spirit of the Squish comics.\n\nHappyMom200: I just hope they tackle the educational aspects well. My kids learned so much about microorganisms from these books while laughing their heads off. It\u2019ll be great for them to watch Squish\u2019s adventures!\n\nBioGeek: Yes! Education through entertainment is the best. I mean, who knew an amoeba could make science this fun? \ud83d\ude05 And considering we\u2019ve all become amateur virologists lately (thanks, 2020), the timing couldn\u2019t be better.\n\nGreenJelly223: For sure, @BioGeek. They have a chance here to really create something that\u2019s as informational as it is entertaining. I also love how the books touch on themes of friendship and acceptance. If they keep that intact, it\u2019s going to be a hit.\n\nMicrobeMania: Anybody have any insider scoop on when we might be getting a peek at the animation or the voice cast? I\u2019m super eager to see anything at this point!\n\nBacteriophage_: Rumors say a teaser might drop sometime in the spring. \ud83c\udf3c Keep your eyes peeled and your streaming devices ready!\n\nAmoebaAmy: Well, here\u2019s hoping Kids WB keeps the slime rolling!

I\u2019ve been keeping an eye out since our last thread went quiet. Mid-March is sooner than I expected. Also heard about some schedule shake-ups. Looks like Apple and Onion is getting shelved for the Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Not sure how I feel about that one.\n\nAmoebaAmy: Squish is starting soon?! That\u2019s awesome! I\u2019m totally having a viewing party with my kids. But wow, Apple and Onion out for Xiaolin Showdown\u2026nostalgia trip, anyone? I did love that show, but it\u2019s a bit of a genre leap from Apple and Onion. \ud83c\udf00\n\nRestInToons: RIP The Tom and Jerry Show. Kinda saw that ending coming. And to be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May? I need new cartoons, not just rewinds. But Steven Universe is still a gem, at least. \ud83d\udc8e\n\nMicrobeMania: No more Tom and Jerry? That\u2019s the end of an era. Though, to be fair, SU reruns are solid. It\u2019s not every day you get a show that tackles heavy themes with magical aliens. Still, can\u2019t help but hope we get some fresh blood in the lineup eventually.\n\nScienceRules45: True, new content is key, but at least we have Squish! And with TTG, Gumball, and Johnny Test holding the fort as flagships, I think Kids WB has a pretty balanced mix. Squish might just be the breath of fresh air we need right now.\n\nGreenJelly223: So, mid-March for Squish, that\u2019s great! Does anyone know if that\u2019s going to affect TTG, Gumball, or Johnny Test air times? I know they\u2019re the heavy hitters, just hoping Squish gets a good slot that doesn\u2019t clash.\n\nTheComicNerd21: Haven\u2019t seen anything about time changes for the flagships. I reckon Squish will find its place without much issue. Kids WB tends to do well with scheduling around their mainstays. And let\u2019s face it\u2014TTG is practically unmovable at this point.\n\nHappyMom200: My kids will be over the moon with the return of Xiaolin Showdown. I loved it as a kid, too. It\u2019s going to be a mix of new and old at our house with Squish and the reruns. I think Kids WB might just pull off this balance. Still, hoping those reruns are just placeholders for future original content.\n\nArtsyOwl: I\u2019m just happy Squish is making its debut! Sure, schedule changes are always a bit of a rollercoaster, but that\u2019s the nature of TV, right? Out with the old, in with the new\u2026 and sometimes back in with the old! \ud83d\ude02\n\nAdmin5: Friendly reminder to keep industry rumor discussions civil.

New fans are getting a taste of some classic toons with Xiaolin Showdown, and Squish has been a pleasant surprise\u2014really nailing it. Plus, Craig of the Creek is always solid. It\u2019s like a buffet of different cartoon flavors this summer.\n\nBacteriophage_: And don\u2019t forget what\u2019s coming in the fall \u2013 new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek, and Johnny Test. September can\u2019t come soon enough!\n\nAmoebaAmy: Squish has been an absolute delight! My kids adore it, and it\u2019s turning into our little summer tradition to watch together. As much as I love TTG and Gumball, it\u2019s Squish that has us tuning in with the most excitement.\n\nTheComicNerd21: A heads-up for all the true toon fans out there: new episodes for some of these shows are usually a blast. I\u2019ve got high hopes for the fall, especially for Craig of the Creek\u2014they\u2019ve been consistently knocking it out of the park.\n\nScienceRules45: I\u2019m just glad we have such variety. Keeps the channel interesting. Summer is always tricky with kids home all day, but this lineup has something for everybody.\n\nArtsyOwl: Agreed on the variety. The blend of classic and contemporary shows has me responding like I\u2019m five and thirteen all at once. \ud83d\ude06 By the way, the art in the latest season of Looney Tunes Cartoons has been stellar. Can\u2019t wait to see what they do next.\n\nMicrobeMania: I am surprised how well Skatoony holds up. It\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but the quizzing with cartoons is unique. And with Scooby Doo and Guess Who featured, it feels like we\u2019ve got a bit of a detective theme going on. Or is it just me?\n\nRestInToons: September seems pretty far, but I got a feeling that new Teen Titans Go and Johnny Test episodes will make some serious waves. Ben 10, too, has been gearing up for something big, at least that\u2019s the vibe.\n\nHappyMom200: It\u2019s a stable lineup for sure. Steven Universe reruns are still a hit in my house. Plus, I appreciate the educational value in shows like Squish. Keeps the kids learning even out of school\u2014parents\u2019 summer dream!\n\nAdmin5: Great to see such positivity about the lineup! As always, discuss your favorite shows, but please remember no spoilers for unaired episodes. Let\u2019s reconvene in this thread when the new episodes drop in September to share our thoughts and reviews!\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up where Robotboy is added to the schedule the next year in May 2022 when Summer begins, B10, LTC and SU are leaving, Robotboy, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks are taking their place, Also in the fall, we have a few new shows, Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the bold and Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated, Also a new acquired comedy cartoon about 2 blobs\nThread Title: Kids WB Schedule Shakeup - Hello Robotboy, So Long Ben 10 & Others! \ud83e\udd16\ud83d\udcfa\n\nGreenJelly223: Hold onto your remotes, toon fans! Coming up next in May 2022, just as summer kicks off, Kids WB is adding Robotboy to the lineup. It\u2019s a nostalgia hit for sure but sad to see some good ones like Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Steven Universe leave us. Thoughts?\n\nTheComicNerd21: Man, Robotboy brings me back. Haven\u2019t seen that little guy in AGES. Sad to see Ben 10 go; it was always a solid watch. But, this is the life of a cartoon fan, right? Out with the old, in with the\u2026 older? \ud83d\ude02\n\nBacteriophage_: Robotboy\u2019s return is quite a surprise. It had that classic boy-and-his-robot vibe. Also, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks? That\u2019s quite the throwback. For those who don\u2019t remember, Chop Socky Chooks was this wild mix of kung fu and chickens\u2014only in cartoons, folks!\n\nCartoonAficionado: Don\u2019t forget about the fall bonanza! Kids WB is loading up with some heavy hitters\u2014Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated. Plus, that new comedy about two blobs? Can\u2019t find much on it, but new content is always exciting!\n\nAmoebaAmy: Wait, so we\u2019re swapping out some superhero action with\u2026 different superhero action, and we\u2019re keeping the mystery with Scooby-Doo. And do I smell a strong comedy theme building up with the two blob cartoon?\n\nRestInToons: Totally digging the superhero update with Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. They bring that comic book essence to the screen. And another comedy about blobs? Guess this one\u2019s the era of the blob, huh?\n\nArtsyOwl: As much as I\u2019ll miss Steven Universe for its depth and progressivism, I guess I\u2019m ready for something light-hearted. Robotboy and the blob comedy might just be the palate cleanser we need. Here\u2019s hoping they deliver some good laughs!\n\nMicrobeMania: Definitely a bummer about Ben 10 and SU. Those shows had such depth in storytelling and character development. But Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated is not to be slept on. That iteration has some of the best arcs for our mystery-solving gang!\n\nScienceRules45: Batman: The Brave and the Bold was a gem! It didn\u2019t take itself too seriously and had just the right amount of camp. And with Ultimate Spider-Man, looks like we\u2019ll still be getting our fix of animated superhero action.\n\nHappyMom200: Love the move to Batman and Spider-Man. My kid has been on a real superhero kick, and Scooby-Doo never gets old. At least, not in my household. The blob comedy sounds intriguing\u2014Kids WB isn\u2019t afraid to experiment, that\u2019s for sure!\n\nAdmin5: With these cartoon cycles, it\u2019s always sad to see some shows go but equally exciting to welcome new titles and welcome back some classics like Robotboy. Remember, fall is just around the corner, so let\u2019s keep the conversation going when those new shows hit the screen.\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up where the blob cartoon is revealed to (be one I made up, hopefully I make it as a YouTube series) be named \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d Gloopy is a normal slime blob wheras Glitter lives up to her name as a sparkling one, Also, a mid season show Code Lyoko is premiering just as COTC knocks off for Summer, Also promos for CSC are already airing\nThread Title: Revealed: \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d Joins Kids WB + Code Lyoko Mid-Season Premiere!\u2728\ud83e\udd16\n\nCartoonAficionado: Alright, the mystery\u2019s solved! The new blob comedy coming to Kids WB is \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d. Gloopy is your average slime blob, and Glitter is, well, super sparkly! Could be a hit if it\u2019s done well. Fingers crossed it\u2019s as fun as the name suggests.\n\nGreenJelly223: \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,\u201d huh? That\u2019s quite the name! I\u2019m all for original content\u2014bringing in some fresh \u2018slime\u2019 to the game. Kudos to the creator, especially if they started on YouTube. That\u2019s one giant leap for slime-kind. \ud83d\ude04\n\nTheComicNerd21: Between Gloopy and Glitter, I\u2019m expecting some madcap hijinks and, hopefully, some good chemistry. Pun totally intended! It\u2019s neat seeing creators move from YouTube to big networks. What a time to be alive!\n\nBacteriophage_: Just saw the promo for Chop Socky Chooks! Honestly, I\u2019d forgotten about that show, but the nostalgia hit me hard. Kids WB really knows how to draw in the old school fans alongside the new ones.\n\nAmoebaAmy: Excited to see what \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d brings to the table! It\u2019s always refreshing to see new characters and stories. Also, did anyone catch that Code Lyoko is coming back as a mid-season show? That\u2019s unexpected! I remember watching that show as a kid\u2014the blend of 2D and 3D animation was so cool.\n\nRestInToons: Code Lyoko? No way! That show was my virtual escape. With Craig of the Creek taking a summer break, Code Lyoko has some big shoes to fill. I\u2019m cautiously optimistic. Also, kudos to the person behind \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d. This is indie creators\u2019 dream!\n\nArtsyOwl: Craig of the Creek is my comfort show, so knowing it\u2019s taking a break has me in my feels. But Code Lyoko might just be the perfect summer binge to replace it. That show was ahead of its time with its virtual world storyline.\n\nMicrobeMania: With Chop Socky Chooks, Code Lyoko, and now \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,\u201d I\u2019m sensing a theme of whimsy and adventure. Perfect for a carefree summer! It\u2019s gonna be a wild ride on Kids WB.\n\nScienceRules45: Indeed, summer is shaping up to be full of adventure and laughs! I\u2019m curious to see the comedic dynamics between Gloopy and Glitter and how they\u2019ll fit into the current lineup. Code Lyoko is an excellent addition for anyone who\u2019s into that sci-fi, virtual reality vibe.\n\nHappyMom200: Just peeped the promo for Gloopy and Glitter with the kids. They\u2019re already quoting lines and chuckling. Also, major props to Kids WB for the diversity in its programming\u2014you\u2019ve got old hits, modern takes, and now a homegrown web series making it to the big leagues.\n\nAdmin5: The summer is looking quite adventurous with all the fresh and returning programming we have on our hands! If \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d or Code Lyoko capture your hearts, be sure to come back and let everyone know. Enjoy the shows, everyone, and let\u2019s support those indie creators making waves!\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up where another mid-season show premieres, replacing Gumball, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\nThread Title: Mid-Season Update: The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Replace Gumball on Kids WB! \ud83e\udd29\ud83c\udfaa\n\nTheComicNerd21: Big news for Kids WB watchers! \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d is premiering mid-season, taking the spot \u201cThe Amazing World of Gumball\u201d left behind. I\u2019ve got high hopes that these thrill-seeking siblings will bring the same level of zany to the lineup. Can they live up to the hilarity of Gumball, though? That\u2019s the big question.\n\nGreenJelly223: Gumball\u2019s out?! Say it isn\u2019t so! That show was a staple! But I remember The Adrenalini Brothers from awhile back\u2026they were full of over-the-top stunts and accents. Hopefully, they can fill the quirky cartoon void that\u2019s gonna be left in Gumball\u2019s wake.\n\nCartoonAficionado: \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d are pure comedic gold with those daredevil antics. Gumball set a high bar for humor and heart, but if you want outrageous adventures and laughs, the Adrenalinis could be just the ticket.\n\nArtsyOwl: I admit, I\u2019ll miss the random humor and clever writing of Gumball. It was one of those shows that had something for viewers of all ages. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have a different flavor, but I\u2019m definitely willing to give them a shot.\n\nBacteriophage_: Well folks, all good things must come to an end, but at least the high-paced energy of The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers might fill the void. They\u2019re not new to the cartoon scene, but let\u2019s hope their stunts are as amazing as ever.\n\nMicrobeMania: \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d is a throwback! Those guys pull off some wild stunts. Kids WB seems to be aiming for high octane to take Gumball\u2019s place. Keeping my fingers crossed that they keep delivering fresh content, even in the form of older gems getting the spotlight again.\n\nRestInToons: Guess it\u2019s goodbye to Gumball and hello Adrenalini. I remember the brothers having quite the international flair. Their eclectic style should make for a refreshing change of pace. Plus, with Squish and the others, Kids WB\u2019s variety is still on point.\n\nAmoebaAmy: My kids loved Gumball, so they\u2019re a bit gutted. But I think The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u2019 daredevil acts might just win them over. I\u2019m always down for more shenanigans. Here\u2019s hoping they get as much character-driven hilarity as Gumball had.\n\nScienceRules45: Gumball\u2019s creativity was unmatched, but The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers? That\u2019s a nostalgia trip! Will be interesting to see how a show that\u2019s been off the radar for a while resonates with the current audience.\n\nHappyMom200: My Gumball marathon nights are coming to an end it seems. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have some big shoes to fill, but I\u2019m ready for the laughs. In Kids WB we trust, right? \ud83d\ude02\n\nAdmin5: Change is part of every TV network\u2019s lifecycle. \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d could be what kids WB needs to shake things up.

Welcome Back Craig & Gumball + Code Lyoko Stays! \ud83c\udf42\ud83d\udcfa\n\nGreenJelly223: It\u2019s fall premiere season, everyone! And with the leaves changing comes new changes to Kids WB. Code Lyoko has secured its spot on the schedule, which I know some of you are thrilled about. The Amazing World of Gumball and Craig of the Creek are making a short-lived comeback, dipping out again in January. Can\u2019t get enough of those two, so I\u2019m here for any time they\u2019re on.\n\nCartoonAficionado: Great to have Gumball and Craig back, even if it\u2019s just for a quick hello and goodbye. It\u2019s like that favorite seasonal dish you can\u2019t stop craving. And Code Lyoko sticking around? Love that for us\u2014those virtual vibes aren\u2019t going anywhere!\n\nTheComicNerd21: Ah, the temporary returns of Gumball and Craig are bittersweet. Makes you wish they\u2019d just stick around full-time. But, I gotta say, Code Lyoko keeping its slot is A-okay with me. That\u2019s one show I\u2019ve been seriously getting back into.\n\nArtsyOwl: The quality storytelling in Craig of the Creek will be sorely missed once January rolls around. And Gumball\u2014it just has that rewatchability factor like no other. Soak it up while you can, folks!\n\nMicrobeMania: Just dropping in to say that Skatoony is going to be back next summer, and I\u2019m here for it! It\u2019s kind of become the unofficial summer tradition since 2018, hasn\u2019t it? Always great to see a show that knows how to fill its seasonal shoes.\n\nBacteriophage_: Yeah, Skatoony\u2019s like that cool summer camp you get excited about all year. But let\u2019s not overlook the fall newcomers too\u2014I\u2019m already setting reminders for Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The superhero binge is real!\n\nRestInToons: Mixed feelings about the short-term return of Gumball and Craig of the Creek. At least we know Kids WB is good at giving us something to look forward to. As for Code Lyoko, it\u2019s been interesting to see a show from yesteryear find its groove with the audience today.\n\nAmoebaAmy: The limited time with Gumball and Craig is better than no time! Let\u2019s enjoy the laughs and adventures while they last. And happy to have confirmed scoops like the one about Skatoony return\u2014it\u2019s this kind of knowledge that keeps the fandom ticking.\n\nScienceRules45: I\u2019ve gotten used to the shift and shuffle of Kids WB\u2019s schedule. You learn to appreciate what you\u2019ve got when you\u2019ve got it. That said, I\u2019m diving headfirst into the nostalgia and newness of this fall\u2019s lineup. It\u2019s going to be an entertaining season!\n\nHappyMom200: I\u2019m grateful for any sprinkles of Craig of the Creek episodes we get! It\u2019s such a gem. And does anyone else get way too competitive watching Skatoony, or is that just me? \ud83d\ude02 Super stoked about its return next year!\n\nAdmin5: Some very astute observations and a tangible excitement for the new and returning shows this fall! Let\u2019s enjoy this season\u2019s offerings, and, as always, keep the conversations engaging as we head into the new year with all its sure-to-be-surprising programming and inevitable farewells.\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up in 2023 where G&G are still rerunning, but Batman, Scooby and Spidey are off, replaced with Ozzy and Drix, World of Quest and Skatoony for summer\nThread Title: 2023 Kids WB Update: Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest & Skatoony Take Over Summer! \ud83c\udf1e\ud83d\udc7e\n\nGreenJelly223: Hey toon enthusiasts! As we hit the sunny stride of 2023, Kids WB is switching up the schedule. We\u2019re saying bye to Batman, Scooby, and Spidey. But don\u2019t despair\u2014Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest, and the ever-reliable Skatoony are here for those summer vibes. Also, \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d are still doing the rerun rounds. Keeping it fresh and funky!\n\nCartoonAficionado: Honestly, it\u2019s cool to see Ozzy & Drix making a comeback. That show was always under the radar but it delivered some solid laughs plus a bit of body-function education. Let\u2019s see how it holds up today!\n\nTheComicNerd21: No more Batman and Spidey is a bummer, but you know what? Bring on the Ozzy & Drix and World of Quest! I remember World of Quest being pretty out there with its humor, a good mix of action and oddball characters\u2014definitely fitting for the wacky tone of summer.\n\nMicrobeMania: Ozzy & Drix, that\u2019s a throwback! I had a feeling it could make a resurgence. Educational and entertaining\u2014that\u2019s a tough balance to strike, but that show had it. Also, cheers to year 5 of summer Skatoony\u2014it\u2019s tradition at this point!\n\nArtsyOwl: Hey, \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d are still in the reruns, too! Shimmering on\u2014quite literally, thanks to Glitter. It\u2019s a quirky and cute show, glad it\u2019s still around for the little ones to enjoy.\n\nBacteriophage_: Seeing World of Quest drop into the lineup makes me hopeful that Kids WB is dedicated to keeping variety alive. Adventure, humor, outright weirdness\u2014it\u2019s got it all. And combined with the educational fun from Ozzy & Drix, plus the game show laughs from Skatoony? Count me in for the summer!\n\nRestInToons: Sayonara superheroes! This season\u2019s lineup shows that kids\u2019 programming isn\u2019t just about capes and villains. It\u2019s about variety, surprise, and a touch of nostalgia. Let\u2019s get microscopic with Ozzy & Drix and go on a wild ride with Quest and Nestor!\n\nAmoebaAmy: Always a tad sad to see the Scooby gang go, but switching up genres keeps things interesting. Ozzy & Drix is kind of like \u201cThe Magic School Bus\u201d for the older crowd, and I\u2019m here for it! Plus, Skatoony is something my kids look forward to every year\u2014glad it\u2019s not going anywhere!\n\nScienceRules45: I\u2019ve got to say, I appreciate how Kids WB keeps mixing in educational content amidst all the comedy and action. Ozzy & Drix is a blast from the past that I\u2019m excited to revisit. It\u2019s just what we need in a world that could use a refresher on health and the human body!\n\nHappyMom200: World of Quest is an underrated treasure, and I\u2019m thrilled it\u2019s coming back into the spotlight. It\u2019s like that fun summer book series but animated. And Skatoony is practically synonymous with summer now; glad to know some things stay solid.\n\nAdmin5: The summer outlook is looking diverse and delightful! With shows that cater to every kind of young fan, there\u2019s no shortage of entertainment. Let\u2019s keep track of these changes and see how they fare in the warm months ahead.

The way they went about this was interesting, In December they started airing promos saying that from January 7 the network would be changing it\u2019s name, it didn\u2019t tell us that 4Kids are now in charge or that there would be new shows, the promo just showed the usual KWB shows like Squish, TAAB, TTG, XS, etc. Also today the promo for the next schedule change (dubbed a Super Duper Late Winter Lineup) has a new slogan \u201cYou\u2019re signed on to the CW4Kids\u201d Slow and painful rebrand? \ud83d\ude12, If you\u2019re not gonna change the bumpers untill Easter then why reveal your flashy new slogan now. Also the website (thecw4kids.com) STILL says this at the footer \u201c\u00a9 2024 Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Global, Nexstar Media Group\u201d Hopefully it is updated to reflect 4Kids\u2019s involvement soon. Write a follow up forum convo where they talk more about the slow transition, and that GoGoRiki is cute, and that it could be primed to take over most of the current comedy cartoons\nThread Title: CW4Kids: A Slow Transition & The Future of Cartoons on the Block? \ud83d\udd04\ud83d\udcfa\n\nToonMasterJay: So, has anyone else noticed how the CW4Kids transition is kinda like watching paint dry? The bumpers feel like Kids WB is haunting us. And they\u2019re dropping their new slogan already, but the website footer is still all about the old guard\u2026 Mixed signals much?\n\nDigitalToonFan: Yeah, the transition is definitely dragging its feet. I mean, if you\u2019re going to bring in 4Kids, then do it with a bang! Not this half-Zoom half-real-life meeting vibe. The new lineup switches could be cool though, but I\u2019ll miss Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers for sure.\n\nGoGoFan223: Honestly, I\u2019m most excited about GoGoRiki (or Smeshariki for the purists). It\u2019s cute and has that potential to be big with the comedy crowd. Less about the action and more laughs\u2014could be the perfect fit for the new direction they\u2019re aiming for.\n\nSonicXforever: Still processing the swap of Squish for Pok\u00e9mon and TAAB for Sonic X\u2026 I mean, sure, classics! But Sonic X has been rerun how many times now? I guess they\u2019re banking on that nostalgia factor to reel us in while they\u2019re redecorating.\n\nPokeNostalgia101: Not going to lie, I\u2019m excited to have Pok\u00e9mon Indigo League back\u2014it\u2019s like comfort food for my soul. But I hear you all, the change is weirdly slow. I get that it\u2019s a big shift from Kids WB to full-on 4Kids ownership, yet you\u2019d think they\u2019d want to make their mark quick.\n\nLyokoLover: Low-key glad Code Lyoko and Xiaolin Showdown are sticking around. They\u2019ve got that unique appeal that isn\u2019t easy to replace. But curious how long till that changes with this new \u201cSuper Duper Late Winter Lineup.\u201d If they\u2019re ushering out TTG and Scooby, who\u2019s next?\n\nAnimanga4Life: Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya coming to the block brings back fond Saturday morning memories! Although, I do get why some are skeptical; a lot of these shows have seen multiple reruns over the years.\n\nWebWader: I keep checking the website hoping it\u2019s been updated\u2026 No dice. The weird blend of old and new branding isn\u2019t helping anyone. At least update the footer to show 4Kids is steering the ship now. How hard can it be?\n\nComicStripKid: The lineup change feels like a balance between targeting the parents who grew up with these shows and trying to appeal to the new gen of cartoon fans. GoGoRiki\u2019s charm and simplicity could be their ticket into the latter\u2019s hearts. I see a mascot in the making.\n\nToonTalker91: Not thrilled about the slow pace here. It\u2019s like we\u2019re stuck in Kids WB limbo. I miss the days when a rebrand meant a fresh start, not this lingering goodbye. Curious how Gloopy and Glitter will fare with the rest of the changes looming\u2026 Will they be the last ones standing?\n\nAdmin_4KidsRevamp: Please bear with us during this transition. We\u2019re working hard to bring a fresh and exciting lineup while honoring the legacy of what came before. Believe us, it\u2019ll be worth the wait!

Nice to see they\u2019re stepping up their game with accounts and points, plus some games to boot!\n\nAnimanga4Life: 4Kids moving in with accounts and points? Sounds like they\u2019re setting up a cool rewards system. And that might just get more kids invested in the website beyond streaming shows\u2014a savvy move.\n\nGoGoFan223: GoGoRiki getting prime time with the big 4Kids dogs is great news. Its cute factor is off the charts. Could be the one to round out the new vibe CW4Kids is going for if they play their cards right.\n\nSonicXforever: Glad to see Sonic racing into the lineup. It\u2019s about time he got back into the limelight. Now to see how he fares among the newer offerings. Talk about a speed battle!\n\nPokeNostalgia101: Pok\u00e9mon getting its rightful place has me all fired up! But it\u2019s kinda odd to still see show pages for the ousted shows on the website. Anyone else notice that? Hopefully, they\u2019ll clear that up soon.\n\nLyokoLover: The fact that Code Lyoko is sticking around amidst all the changes shows its resilience. Maybe 4Kids recognizes the gold they have with some of these Kids WB shows. The perfect yin to their yang.\n\nComicStripKid: Well, can\u2019t say 4Kids isn\u2019t taking a balanced approach to this transition. Keeping half the lineup from Kids WB seems like a strategic way to ensure they don\u2019t lose the existing audience while they woo new viewers with nostalgia and updated features.\n\nWebWader: The website is getting there, slowly but surely. With account functionality and games, it looks like 4Kids is channeling some vintage interactivity magic. Here\u2019s to mission: engage the digitally-savvy generation!\n\nToonTalker91: Seeing \u201c\u00a9 2024 4Kids Entertainment\u201d at the bottom of the website gives me mixed emotions\u2014it\u2019s good to see they\u2019re updating stuff, but the nostalgia for Kids WB is real.

But we\u2019re keeping the virtual adventures of Code Lyoko and the quirky \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d\u2014two survivors of the cull.\n\nAnimanga4Life: For the manga/anime fans, Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series is swooping in to replace the original Pok\u00e9mon series! Exciting to see some new journeys and battles. Gotta love the continuous evolution of the Pok\u00e9mon franchise on the CW4Kids.\n\nGoGoFan223: And what about that triple threat joining the fray? Chaotic, TMNT: Back to the Sewer, and Viva Pi\u00f1ata are about to spice things up! Feels like 4Kids is tossing in as many flavors as they can to see what sticks.\n\nSonicXforever: Greatest thing about CW4Kids right now? They\u2019re not afraid to mix it up. The digital look update has me hyped\u2014it\u2019s like the block is leveling up. Hopefully, it adds a fresh vibe that resonates with the digital generation.\n\nPokeNostalgia101: Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series will def pull in the crowd looking for that cutting-edge anime action. Pok\u00e9mon always knows how to keep things fresh.\n\nLyokoLover: Sad to see some old friends go, but Code Lyoko holding strong gives me hope. It\u2019s like our own little slice of stability in this whirlwind of changes.\n\nComicStripKid: With the digital online style coming, CW4Kids is clearly gunning for a certain look and feel. Let\u2019s just cross our fingers it blends seamlessly with the cartoon essence we all tune in for.\n\nWebWader: Do you think bringing in Chaotic, TMNT, and Viva Pi\u00f1ata is going too far back into the vault? I\u2019m all for nostalgia, but I hope they still invest in newer properties or original content. Balance is key.\n\nToonTalker91: Big stuff with Pok\u00e9mon Horizons; it\u2019s been creating buzz all over! As for Chaotic and TMNT: Back to the Sewer, that\u2019s unexpected! Not so sure what to expect from Viva Pi\u00f1ata, though\u2026 a wildcard entry, I\u2019d say.\n\nAdmin_4KidsRevamp: Expect the unexpected with CW4Kids! We\u2019re committed to delivering a modern digital vibe with the shows you love, new and old.

We\u2019re also getting \u201cSmile Precure\u201d under the guise of \u201cGlitter Force,\u201d and \u201cYo-Kai Watch\u201d is making a splash. Plus, new \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d episodes on the horizon!\n\nToonMasterJay: \u201cVampire Hunters\u201d better not be sliced and diced to oblivion; \u201cDemon Slayer\u201d thrives on its action! But knowing 4Kids, our expectations for uncensored content should be\u2014well, tempered. Hopefully, they keep enough of the original spirit intact.\n\nDigitalToonFan: \u201cGlitter Force,\u201d huh? Reminds me of their old \u201cSailor Moon\u201d days. \u201cSmile Precure\u201d is a great series, so I\u2019m curious how much will be changed. As long as the essence is there, I suppose it\u2019ll capture the audience it\u2019s meant for.\n\nGoGoFan223: More GoGoRiki, sign me up! That show has been a surprisingly funny sleeper hit. It\u2019s got its own quirky charm that\u2019s been keeping kids and some of us adults entertained.\n\nMangaMogul: Alright, \u201cYo-Kai Watch\u201d making the fall line-up is sweet. I\u2019m cautiously optimistic about how it will be adapted. It has a lot of cultural references that I hope don\u2019t get lost in translation.\n\nSonicXforever: Honestly, I\u2019m a mix of excited and nervous. The anime choices are solid, but we all remember how 4Kids framed other shows in the past. As long as they don\u2019t stray too far from the source material, it could work out.\n\nPokeNostalgia101: Whoever pitched \u201cDemon Slayer\u201d as \u201cVampire Hunters\u201d deserves a\u2026 medal? It\u2019s certainly a creative spin. Fingers crossed that \u201cYo-Kai Watch\u201d retains its charm and doesn\u2019t face the same fate.\n\nWebWader: It\u2019s a major throwback to 4Kids\u2019 old strategies\u2014rebranding anime with Western sensibilities. Sometimes it worked, sometimes not so much. Here\u2019s hoping for the former this time around without losing too much authenticity.\n\nComicStripKid: \u201cGlitter Force,\u201d eh? We\u2019ll see. It\u2019s gotta be a tricky balance of keeping the action-friendly for younger audiences while not alienating the fans. And yo, new GoGoRiki episodes\u2014those character designs just stick with you.\n\nLyokoLover: 4Kids and anime have a\u2026 complicated history. But I\u2019m here for the anime, so I\u2019ll give \u201cVampire Hunters\u201d and \u201cGlitter Force\u201d a chance. As for \u201cYo-Kai Watch,\u201d it could be a hit if handled with care.\n\nToonTalker91: The anime announcements have potential, but the true test will be the execution. \u201cDemon Slayer\u201d is huge, so even a watered-down \u201cVampire Hunters\u201d might hook viewers. Excited for new GoGoRiki eps and curious about \u201cGlitter Force\u201d as well.\n\nAdmin_4KidsRevamp: We\u2019ve heard your concerns and your excitement!

I was really starting to get into [Show Name]. Sad to see it didn't make the cut for the full schedule. \ud83d\ude22\n\nToonAdvocate: Yeah, it's a bummer. [Show Name] had a unique charm that's hard to find in other shows. It's disappointing to see it go, but at least there's a silver lining.\n\nPixelPioneer: Right, I saw on the official website that [Show Name] will still be available on 4kids.tv for those who want to catch up or rewatch episodes. Plus, they mentioned it\u2019ll air in truncated versions as filler content between shows. Not ideal, but better than disappearing completely.\n\nCartoonCritic: That's somewhat reassuring. Truncated versions won\u2019t be the same, but if it introduces the show to viewers who might've missed it, that could be a good thing. Maybe if it gets enough online and filler airtime love, they'll reconsider its slot in the future.\n\nAnimeAngel: It's an innovative way to keep [Show Name] somewhat alive on the network. And thank goodness for 4kids.tv; streaming platforms really are becoming lifelines for shows like these. It\u2019s a bit of a consolation prize, but I\u2019ll take what I can get.\n\nGraphicGeek: Interestingly, this could set a precedent for how future shows are treated. If [Show Name] does well in its truncated form and online, it might make the execs think twice about which shows to sideline. Here\u2019s hoping!\n\nRetroToonFan: Does anyone know how \u201ctruncated\u201d these versions are going to be? Are we talking just major plot points, or will they include some character development and humor too? [Show Name] really shines through its witty dialogues and character arcs.\n\nDigitalDreamer: From what I gathered, the focus will likely be on the major plot points to fit the shorter airtime. But 4kids.tv should have the full episodes, so ideally, viewers could jump over to binge the full experience if the truncated versions pique their interest.\n\nToonMasterJay: A strategic move by #CW4Kids, showing there\u2019s still some love for [Show Name]. Sure, it\u2019s not front and center, but in this age, digital platforms offer a whole new avenue for shows to survive and thrive. Let\u2019s keep supporting [Show Name] online, who knows what might happen?\n\nAnimationAficionado: Absolutely, Jay. Everyone, let\u2019s rally behind [Show Name] on 4kids.tv!

Been thinking about the recent shifts in the CW4Kids lineup and how \"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\" is being treated with its transition out. It made me wonder, why didn\u2019t Johnny Test get similar treatment when it was taken off the air? \ud83e\udd14\n\nRetroToonRanger: That's a good point, ToonFan88. Johnny Test was a staple for so long, you'd think they would\u2019ve at least kept it alive on 4kids.tv or done truncated airings. It was hugely popular, so it's strange they didn't attempt to keep it going in some form.\n\nPixelPatriot: If memory serves, wasn't Johnny Test still pretty accessible elsewhere online and maybe tied up in other streaming or distribution deals at the time? That could\u2019ve limited what CW4Kids or 4kids.tv could do in terms of keeping it in rotation or offering it on their platform.\n\nAnimatedInsight: True, @PixelPatriot. Licensing and distribution rights can be a nightmare. With Johnny Test, those factors likely played a role. G&G, being a unique situation and possibly with less complex rights issues, gives CW4Kids more flexibility to keep it around in some format.\n\nToonMasterJay: Plus, you've got to consider timing and strategy changes within the network. Maybe the decision-makers now are more inclined to find ways to retain shows through digital platforms and fillers, learning from past experiences like Johnny Test\u2019s departure.\n\nNostalgiaNerd: @ToonMasterJay makes a great point. The landscape of digital content and how networks handle shows is always changing. Johnny Test leaving could have been a learning curve for them; it\u2019s just unfortunate for Johnny Test fans that the show was a bit ahead of its time in that regard.\n\nCartoonConnoisseur: I miss Johnny Test, and seeing G&G get this treatment does sting a bit. However, it\u2019s comforting to know networks are finding new ways to keep our beloved toons alive, even if they're not front and center anymore. Hopefully, this sets a precedent for future shows.\n\nDigitalDreamer: It\u2019d be awesome if, down the line, they do something special for Johnny Test, given its impact. Never say never in the world of animation and digital platforms. Maybe fan demand can bring about some form of revival or special airing.\n\nAdmin_4KidsRevamp: Appreciate all the feedback, folks!

However, has anyone considered that audience loyalty might play a big role here? We've grown with these shows, after all.\n\n**NostalgiaNerd**: Speaking of what 4Kids is up to, I've heard they've already got something big earmarked for May 24. Looks like our speculation might be a tad late. And rumor has it, they've secured an English dub of \"Smeshariki\" for the fall. Seems like they're not just banking on their existing roster.\n\n**AnimeFan_09**: @NostalgiaNerd, seriously? That's news to me. \"Smeshariki\" is huge internationally; if they manage to pull off a good English dub, it could be a game-changer for them. May 24 is just around the corner, which doesn't leave much window for speculation. \n\n**CartoonLoverX**: Wow, @NostalgiaNerd, that's quite the scoop! \"Smeshariki\" might just be the fresh content 4Kids needs. Guess it's not just about how good our shows are, but also what 4Kids brings to the table this fall.\n\n**ToonTalker**: Guess the battle for Saturday mornings is about to get even more interesting. With \"Smeshariki\" on their side, 4Kids is playing to win. Here\u2019s hoping our current lineup can hold its own and maybe we\u2019ll see some new additions that can keep the competition fierce!\n\n**SuperHeroFanatic**: End of the day, competition is good, right? Pushes everyone to up their game. I just hope we continue to see quality content that keeps us all glued to our screens, no matter who's dishing it out.\n\n**AnimeFan_09**: Couldn't agree more, @SuperHeroFanatic. It\u2019s an exciting time for Saturday morning cartoons, and I'm here for the ride. Let's keep supporting our favorites and hope the networks keep the hits coming!\n\n**Thread Locked by Moderator**\n\n**Moderator**: Thanks for participating in the vibrant discussion, everyone!

MonAll Restart & Random Ep Madness!\n\n**CartoonConnoisseur**: Did anyone else catch the lineup this morning? Monster Allergy (MonAll) just reset to the first episode! And Johnny Test threw us a curveball with a random S1 episode. What's going on? And with CW4Kids kicking off next week, things are getting weirder.\n\n**StaticFan88**: Noticed that too! And don't get me started on Static Shock showing the \u201cJimmy\u201d episode. Of all episodes to air before the CW4Kids transition, why choose the one that's controversial for its heavy themes? Feels like a strange choice given the timing.\n\n**RetroToonLover**: This whole day felt like a throwback to me. But the return to MonAll\u2019s first episode could just be them trying to reintroduce the series to grab new viewers right before CW4Kids starts. A bit odd, but kinda makes sense marketing-wise?\n\n**JohnnyQuestFan**: For Johnny Test, picking a random episode from S1 feels like they\u2019re scrambling or something broke down in their scheduling. Can't see how this would be intentional, especially this close to the new launch.\n\n**ToonTheory**: Here's a theory - What if they're clearing the decks or doing a soft-reset before CW4Kids starts? Like trying to wrap up or provide a nostalgia trip before they bring in the new content. The \"Jimmy\" episode airing might be them pushing boundaries while they still can.\n\n**NostalgiaNerd**: Nostalgia trip or not, today's lineup was a mixed bag. Feels like they're experimenting with us. Really curious how CW4Kids will kick things off next week. Hopefully, with less randomness and more coherence.\n\n**EpisodesArchivist**: It's definitely a puzzling choice to air these particular episodes today. \"Jimmy\" is a powerful episode, no doubt, but re-airing episode one of MonAll and a random Johnny Test from S1? Seems like someone hit the random button on the schedule.\n\n**CartoonConnoisseur**: Perhaps they are testing waters, seeing how we react to surprise changes. CW4Kids might bring a fresh approach next week, fingers crossed. Today was just bizarre enough to make us talk. Might be the point?\n\n**StaticFan88**: True, today's schedule got us all chatting. Still, hoping for more stability with CW4Kids. Surprises are fun, but I'm here for the new adventures and consistent storytelling.\n\n**RetroToonLover**: Agreed! Here's hoping CW4Kids brings back some order to our beloved Saturday mornings. And more importantly, introduces some epic new shows to get hooked on!\n\n**Moderator**: Great discussion, everyone! Today's lineup sure gave us plenty to talk about. With CW4Kids on the horizon, it's an exciting time for cartoon fans. Let's reconvene next week and see what the new era brings.

With June already heating up, it looks like the lineup for our Saturday mornings is getting a major update come June 21. Excited to see TMNT: Fast Forward, Chaotic, and Yu-Gi-Oh GX joining the fray! But with new arrivals, we're also seeing some shows leave and others stay till Fall. Thoughts?\n\n**NinjaTurtleFan**: TMNT: Fast Forward? Yes! Been waiting for this. The futuristic setting is such a cool twist. Kinda bittersweet to see some other shows go, though. Do we know which ones are saying goodbye for now?\n\n**CardDuelist**: Chaotic and Yu-Gi-Oh GX coming in is such a power move! Finally, more card-dueling action on our screens. It's a good time to be a trading card game fan. But yeah, curious about which shows we're losing to make room.\n\n**StaticFan88**: Managed to catch a glimpse of the departing list.

Those have been solid, so glad they're sticking around.

Seems like they're aiming for a more action-packed lineup going into the second half of the year.\n\n**JohnnyQuestFan**: A bit bummed about \"Johnny Test\" taking a break. It's been such a staple. But, change is part of the cartoon ecosystem. Excited to see how \"Chaotic\" and the others fit into our weekend mornings. Plus, \"Johnny Test\" will probably come back with something new to offer after the pause.\n\n**EpisodesArchivist**: Does anyone know the rationale behind these changes? Is it purely for freshening up the lineup, or are there bigger strategy shifts at play? Either way, the focus on action and adventure seems clear. \"TMNT: Fast Forward\" could really rejuvenate things.\n\n**NostalgiaNerd**: It feels like they're gearing up for a more dynamic and possibly older demographic with these additions. \"TMNT: Fast Forward\" and the card game shows bring a different kind of energy. Sad to see any show go, but the newcomers have potential.\n\n**Moderator**: Great insights, everyone! Change is always a mix of excitement and nostalgia for what we\u2019re leaving behind. But as fans, it\u2019s thrilling to see how our lineup evolves. Let\u2019s give the newcomers a warm welcome and stay tuned for what promises to be an action-packed summer and fall.

Hoping it finds a new home or way to continue for the fans.\n\n**EpisodesArchivist**: It's the ebb and flow of TV programming, I guess. \"Viva Pi\u00f1ata\" appealed to a younger demographic with its colorful and educational content.

Considering its controversial nature, why do you think CW4Kids keeps choosing this episode for pivotal moments?\n\n**ToonTheory**: It's a good point, @StaticFan88. The episode deals with some heavy themes that are quite impactful. Perhaps CW4Kids is aiming to spark conversations, showing they're not shying away from difficult topics, even in a cartoon format. Could be a statement on their part? \n\n**RetroToonLover**: I've noticed that as well. It's a brave choice, given its content. Animation has the power to address complex issues in an accessible way. Maybe they're trying to elevate the conversation and engage their audience more deeply?\n\n**CartoonConnoisseur**: That's an interesting theory, but it's a double-edged sword, isn't it? Using a cartoon to tackle hard-hitting issues can be enlightening, but it also risks alienating some of the audience who might not expect or want such topics in their Saturday morning lineup.\n\n**NostalgiaNerd**: Also, considering this episode aired around major changes previously, it almost feels like they\u2019re using it as a marker of transition.

Repeatedly airing controversial episodes at significant junctures\u2014CW4Kids might be aiming for a branding of sorts. Portraying themselves as a network unafraid to tackle tough conversations through their programming.\n\n**DinoWatcher**: True, but there\u2019s a fine line. They have to balance educational intent with entertainment value. Kids\u2019 programming is a powerful tool for teaching, but it shouldn\u2019t feel like a lecture. Getting it right requires sensitivity and timing.\n\n**ToonTheory**: @DinoWatcher, absolutely. Timing and context are everything. Maybe CW4Kids sees these transitional periods as moments when their audience is more open to messaging? Like, during times of change, people might be more receptive to deeper messages.\n\n**JohnnyQuestFan**: It would be insightful to see the viewer feedback and how it\u2019s shifted over the times this episode has aired.

Circling back to our previous discussion about \"Static Shock\" airing the \"Jimmy\" episode on May 17, June 21, and now the upcoming September 13. It's a very impactful episode, tackling issues of gun violence and its consequences. Still, the choice of these specific dates for airing it raises questions. Any new thoughts on why these dates were chosen?\n\n**ToonTheory**: I've been pondering over this, and I think it's no coincidence that \"Jimmy\" airs during periods of transition or when the schedule undergoes significant changes. This episode not only garners attention due to its subject matter but also seems to signal shifts within the network's programming or ethos.\n\n**RetroToonLover**: Agreed, @ToonTheory. May 17 was right before the switch to summer programming, June 21 marked the summer solstice and often aligns with schedule changes, and now Sep 13 heralds the fall season. Each of these dates represents a key point where audience engagement might be uniquely high or receptive to impactful content.\n\n**CartoonConnoisseur**: That\u2019s an interesting perspective. It seems like CW4Kids might be using this episode as a marker or beacon during periods of change, perhaps to underline their commitment to discussing real-world issues. Still, it\u2019s a bold move, given the nature of Saturday morning programming. \n\n**NostalgiaNerd**: Could also be a strategic way to repeat an episode that maybe didn't reach as wide of an audience initially but is considered important by the network. These dates grab attention\u2014perfect for airing something meant to make a statement or provoke discussion.\n\n**EpisodesArchivist**: From a programming standpoint, airing \"Jimmy\" during these periods could create a routine or expectation amongst viewers. This could be a method to highlight their socially responsible content amidst more traditional animated fare, ensuring it reaches viewers during peak transition times when they might be paying more attention to the lineup changes.\n\n**ToonAmbassador**: Have we considered the educational impact? School's in session around September 13, approaching summer break by May 17, and well into vacation by June 21. Each airing aligns with times when discussions about violence and its repercussions could be happening among kids and teens - either in school or at home.\n\n**DinoWatcher**: There\u2019s merit to airing it at times when kids are more likely to be with peers or family who can help them process the episode's message. It\u2019s not just about the airing but fostering a broader conversation around the themes \"Jimmy\" presents.\n\n**JohnnyQuestFan**: It's strategic, for sure. I wonder if the network has received feedback on this approach. Are they tracking how these airings align with social media chatter or viewer responses? It\u2019d be insightful to see if and how the impact varies each time.\n\n**Moderator**: Another thoughtful discussion! It's evident that an episode like \"Jimmy\" can have a profound impact, regardless of when it airs. Yet, choosing specific dates seems to amplify its message, aligning with moments of change, discussion, and attention. Whether for strategic or educational purposes, CW4Kids\u2019 approach to airing this episode sparks important conversations.

Based on the setup you've described, we'll reimagine the final Kids WB lineup by integrating \"Spider Riders\" and one other show from the 2006-2007 lineup that didn't make it into the final airing. Let's choose \"Monster Allergy\" as the other show to reintroduce. This lineup would be adjusted to fit these two series just after \"Magi-Nation\". Let's consider the adjustments as if they were made to accommodate these changes in a seamless and engaging way for the audience. Here\u2019s how the slightly altered final Kids WB lineup could have looked:\n\n1. **The Batman**\n2. **Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!**\n3. **Tom and Jerry Tales**\n4. **Legion of Super Heroes**\n5. **The Spectacular Spider-Man**\n6. **Magi-Nation**\n7. **Spider Riders**\n8. **Monster Allergy**\n9. **Skunk Fu!**\n10. **Will & Dewitt**\n11. **Eon Kid**\n\nBy adding \"Spider Riders\" right after \"Magi-Nation,\" fans of action and adventure cartoons would have had a back-to-back dose of excitement. \"Spider Riders\" is an animated series where heroes fight to save the Inner World, a fantastic realm located within the Earth. It's filled with adventure, heroes, and fantastical creatures, so it would follow \"Magi-Nation\" quite naturally in terms of tone and content.\n\nFollowing \"Spider Riders\" with \"Monster Allergy\" offers a slightly lighter, comedic touch while still keeping with the adventurous spirit. \"Monster Allergy\" is another animated series that deals with a young boy who has the ability to see and interact with monsters, adding an interesting blend of humor, supernatural elements, and storylines about friendship and bravery.\n\nThis lineup would have offered a good mix of humor, action, and adventure, keeping viewers engaged with a variety of themes and characters. By carefully integrating \"Spider Riders\" and \"Monster Allergy\" into the sequence, Kids WB could have provided a balanced and entertaining experience that appealed to a broad audience of kids."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a forum convo with the lineup saying JT is gone, saying Johnny stayed behind so Will and Dewitt could walk so Zick could run\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**AnimeKid1990**: Hey everyone, just saw the final Kids WB lineup.

Honestly, I think it was so \"Will and Dewitt\" could walk so Zick from \"Monster Allergy\" could run. \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udca8\n\n**SpiderRiderFan42**: Haha, love that analogy, RetroToonLover! \"Will and Dewitt\" was cute and all, but \"Monster Allergy\" has that unique mix of adventure and humor. Plus, Zick is such a cool character with his ability to see and interact with monsters. \ud83d\udc09\n\n**AnimeKid1990**: True, \"Monster Allergy\" does bring a fresh vibe. But I'm gonna miss \"Johnny Test.\" That show had its charm despite the mixed opinions.\n\n**ToonTalker**: I think Johnny Test sticking around for as long as it did helped keep that adventurous spirit alive on Kids WB. It paved the way for more adventurous, fantasy-filled shows. \"Will and Dewitt\" and \"Monster Allergy\" just take it in different directions.\n\n**CartoonFanatic88**: Agreed, ToonTalker. Each show brought something different. \"Will and Dewitt\" had its life lessons with a slice of adventure, while \"Monster Allergy\" goes deeper into the fantasy realm. It's like passing the baton in a relay race of awesome content.\n\n**RetroToonLover**: Definitely. And it's kinda poetic when you think about it. These shows are interconnected in the grand tapestry of Kids WB's history. \"Spider Riders\" following right after \"Magi-Nation\" in the new lineup also shows that. A continuous thread of themes revolving around friendship, adventure, and battling against the odds.\n\n**SpiderRiderFan42**: Well put, RetroToonLover. It\u2019s like each show handed off something valuable to the next, contributing to a richer legacy. Hopefully, \"Monster Allergy\" will keep that legacy going strong. Can't wait to see where Zick's adventures take us!\n\n**AnimeKid1990**: For sure. Here's to hoping Kids WB's final lineup leaves us with some memorable moments. And who knows?

If that's the direction they're heading, I'm all in. More action-based cartoons would be a blast. And speaking of action, does anyone know WHAT HAPPENED to \"World of Quest\"? It vanished faster than it appeared, only on for like 3 weeks!\n\n**SpiderWebWatcher**: Totally bummed about \"World of Quest\" getting the axe so quick. Last I checked, \"Spider Riders\" has taken its slot. Don't get me wrong, \"Spider Riders\" is cool, but \"Quest\" had potential. As for the summer lineup rumor, I'm crossing my fingers for it to be a \"Spider-Man\" hour block. Could the other show be something superhero-themed too?\n\n**4KidsConspiracy**: Heard through the grapevine about the Spider-Man hour. If we're speculating on the other show, my money's on something from the Marvel universe to complement Spider-Man. Maybe \"X-Men: Evolution\" or are we getting something fresh? Either way, sounds like action is the theme of the summer.\n\n**ToonTracker**: Seriously disappointed about \"World of Quest\" - felt like it barely got a chance. As for summer theories, I'm hopeful for more superhero content. Though, wouldn't mind if they threw us a curveball and introduced an action-packed anime. We know 4Kids has a knack for that. \"Yu-Gi-Oh!\" and \"Pokemon\" thrived under them, so who knows?\n\n**RetroHeroFan**: Agree with the disappointment over \"Quest.\" Seemed like a fun show. About the Spider-Man hour, adding another superhero show sounds about right. But wouldn't it be something if they introduced a totally new hero show? Maybe something we've never seen before?\n\n**ActionFan321**: @4KidsConspiracy \"X-Men: Evolution\" would be a dream come true! Though, with 4Kids' history, they might just surprise us with a reboot of something classic or an entirely new direction. Either way, it seems like they\u2019re hinting at ramping up the action before the takeover.\n\n**SpiderWebWatcher**: Would be cool if they did a mix of both - one classic superhero show and one entirely new concept. That would keep both the old-school fans happy and bring in new viewers. Either way, more action shows before the shift sound like a win-win.\n\n**ToonSpectator**: It's all speculative at this point, but exciting nonetheless. The addition of \"Monster Allergy\" already shows a willingness to blend genres. Here's hoping the lead-up to the 4Kids era keeps that momentum with even more action-packed shows.

While I'm going to miss \"The Batman\" and \"Legion,\" I have to admit, \"TMNT: Fast Forward\" has been pretty awesome. And \"Chaotic\"? Totally didn't expect to get so hooked on it. \"Yu-Gi-Oh! GX\" is a solid continuation for the card game craze.\n\n**4KidsConspiracy**: It's almost like they're prepping us for something bigger. With this shift towards more action and adventure with \"Chaotic\" and \"TMNT,\" I'm getting the vibe that they're testing waters for a certain demographic. Anyone else feel like some of these additions are being prepped-up for later use?\n\n**ToonTracker**: @4KidsConspiracy Totally get what you're saying. It feels strategic. Introduce new action shows, build a dedicated viewer base, and then introduce even more related content that targets those viewers. \"Chaotic\" is a great example \u2013 blending card gaming with action/adventure, possibly grooming fans for more content in that vein.\n\n**SpiderWebWatcher**: Speaking of prepping, noticed how \"Chaotic\" blends gaming with a narrative story - feels like they're capitalizing on the interactive entertainment trend. If this is the direction they\u2019re heading, I\u2019m curious about what\u2019s next. Could we see more shows that blend other media forms with traditional animation?\n\n**AnimeKid1990**: Absolutely love the new additions! \"TMNT: Fast Forward\" is a fresh take on the turtles that I didn't know I needed. \"Chaotic\" being added to the mix feels like they're definitely gearing up for something bigger. Could we be seeing a push towards more interactive and gaming-inspired shows?\n\n**ToonSpectator**: @SpiderWebWatcher and @AnimeKid1990 hit the nail on the head. It's not just the action; it's the interactive and modern angle they're taking. This might be the new direction they\u2019re aiming for. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if they introduced a show that directly tied into an online game or app down the line.\n\n**ActionFan321**: This shift is interesting and a bit sad for the fans of the shows that got replaced. But can't deny, \"Yu-Gi-Oh! GX\" introducing even more complex duels and strategies has been a blast. Seems like they\u2019re targeting viewers that are into a blend of action, strategy, and possibly even tech.\n\n**RetroHeroFan**: Wonder what\u2019s next on their agenda. With \"Chaotic\" being such a unique addition to the lineup, blending real world and animated gaming, it does feel like they\u2019re prepping the audience for something bigger. Here\u2019s hoping they continue to surprise us in a good way.\n\n**4KidsConspiracy**: Only time will tell what they have up their sleeves.

This is the kind of content I've been hoping for. Any bets on what the third show might be?\n\n**ActionFan321**: My guess for the third slot? I'm leaning towards \"Magi-Nation\" or possibly bringing back \"Johnny Test\" for that. They've both got that adventure vibe that pairs well with \"Spider-Man\" and the immersive world of \"Chaotic.\"\n\n**RetroHeroFan**: Totally here for this power hour and a half. \"Chaotic\" and \"Spider-Man\" are perfect choices. High-energy, immersive worlds, and action-packed \u2013 what's not to love? Curious though, why they decided to go with this format. Feels like they're really aiming to cement a solid viewership block.\n\n**4KidsConspiracy**: This lineup screams strategy! By anchoring with \"Chaotic\" and \"Spider-Man,\" they're targeting that core action-loving demographic. And including a wildcard third show? Genius. It keeps people guessing and talking, just like we are now. They're adapting and trying new formats, and I'm all for it.\n\n**AnimeKid1990**: Has anyone considered the possibility the third show could be something entirely new? Kids WB might be using the popularity of \"Chaotic\" and \"Spider-Man\" to introduce a brand-new series. Could be a smart move to launch a new hit.\n\n**ToonSpectator**: Good point, @AnimeKid1990. Launching a new show alongside established hits could give it the boost it needs. Either way, this power hour and a half is a bold move. Kids WB seems to be upping their game, and it's exciting to see what this will bring.\n\n**ActionFan321**: Exactly, and let\u2019s not overlook the timing - starting this in August, just before the fall season, could be a play to hook viewers before they roll out the full fall lineup. Smart timing, with schools just getting back in session, offering kids something to look forward to on the weekends.\n\n**SpiderWebWatcher**: I'm eager to see the dynamics of this block. \"Chaotic\" has that blend of action and strategy, \"Spider-Man\" brings the superhero action and moral dilemmas, and adding a third show could balance the block with humor, sci-fi, or even more superhero antics. This could redefine Saturday morning cartoons for us.\n\n**RetroHeroFan**: Whatever show they choose to fill that third spot, I'm just thrilled Kids WB is pushing the envelope. This power hour and a half might just be the thing to reignite the magic of weekend cartoons. Here's hoping it lives up to the hype and brings us all back to the glory days of getting up early on Saturdays.\n\n**4KidsConspiracy**: Keep your eyes peeled, folks. This is only the beginning.

Some of you suggested \"Johnny Test\" might be the third show, but considering CW4Kids is about to fully launch in just a few weeks, I'm having second thoughts.\n\n**SpiderWebWatcher**: Yeah, I'm with you, @ToonTracker. Given that CW4Kids swiped away \"World of Quest\" and \"Johnny Test\" for \"Spider Riders\" and \"Monster Allergy,\" it doesn't seem likely they'd bring back \"Johnny Test\" so soon, does it? Seems like they're aiming for a fresh start with the new block.\n\n**ActionFan321**: True, and to add to that, the decision to remove shows like \"Johnny Test\" probably signals they're moving away from that type of content, at least for the launch of CW4Kids. They might be aiming for something that aligns more with the \"action-adventure\" feel of \"Chaotic\" and \"Spider-Man.\"\n\n**RetroHeroFan**: Agreed, everyone. It does seem more and more like they\u2019re curating content that fits a specific theme or genre. Perhaps they\u2019re pushing for a more cohesive viewer experience with CW4Kids. Looking back, \"Johnny Test\" was fun, but it was more of a comedic take with action elements, not strictly action/adventure.\n\n**4KidsConspiracy**: Considering this shift, maybe the third show in the power hour and a half block is something we haven't predicted yet. If they're avoiding reintroducing recently removed shows like \"Johnny Test,\" this could be a prime opportunity to introduce either a new show or one that hasn't seen as much limelight but fits their action/adventure focus.\n\n**AnimeKid1990**: That's a great point. CW4Kids might see this as a chance to either launch a brand-new series or bring attention to an underappreciated one that complements the vigorous energy of \u201cChaotic\u201d and \u201cSpider-Man\u201d.

With the new fall lineup revealed and the shift towards more 4Kids-centric shows, I've been pondering something that's perhaps on a few of our minds: What was the point of bringing back \"Spider Riders\" (SR) and \"Monster Allergy\" (MA) over the summer if they were just going to be dropped by fall anyway?\n\n**ActionFan321**: That's a good question, @ToonTracker. It felt like they were trying to rekindle interest in these shows, possibly as a test to see how well they'd perform before fully committing to the new 4Kids direction. Maybe they were placeholders until the new lineup was ready?\n\n**RetroHeroFan**: I've been wondering the same thing. It almost feels like SR and MA were sort of a \"farewell tour\" for the old Kids WB format. A final nod before transitioning fully into what we now see as a heavily 4Kids influenced lineup. A bit of an abrupt shift, if you ask me.\n\n**4KidsConspiracy**: Here's a theory: Perhaps reintroducing SR and MA was a strategic move to maintain a certain level of viewer engagement and diversity in content during the transition period. They might've hoped these familiar titles would keep us tuned in as they finalized the new lineup deals and marketing strategies.\n\n**SpiderWebWatcher**: Plus, let's not overlook the possibility of licensing and scheduling logistics playing a role. Maybe it was easier or more cost-effective to bring back SR and MA temporarily, given they were already part of the library, rather than acquiring something new for a short span.\n\n**AnimeKid1990**: Also, could it have been a way to gauge what type of content current viewers are into? Like a live experiment to see if action-adventure shows still had the pull compared to the incoming new(er) titles. The outcome might have influenced some of the final decisions for the fall lineup.\n\n**ToonSpectator**: It's a bit disappointing, though. Just when you get reattached to shows like SR and MA, they're gone again. It underscores the ephemeral nature of TV programming, but it's a harsh reminder for fans who invest time in these series.\n\n**ActionFan321**: True, @ToonSpectator. It does sting a bit. On the upside, it was nice to revisit those worlds, even if just for a brief moment. Perhaps the silver lining is that the powers-that-be are still willing to experiment with the lineup, which could mean more surprises down the road (hopefully pleasant ones).\n\n**RetroHeroFan**: Let's also not forget the potential for streaming services or digital platforms to pick up these shows. With the changing landscape of how we consume media, a show's departure from TV doesn't necessarily mean it's gone for good. Fingers crossed for more accessible formats in the future.\n\n**SpiderWebWatcher**: For now, it looks like we'll have to adapt to the new normal and keep our nostalgia in check. Who knows? This might open the door for us to discover new favorites. Plus, the discussion and speculation have been fun, albeit a bit bittersweet.\n\n**ToonTracker**: Appreciate all the insights, team. It\u2019s a reminder of how dynamic and sometimes unpredictable the world of TV programming can be.

It feels unfair to both the show and its budding fan base to yank it away so quickly.\n\n**ActionFan321**: Absolutely, @ToonTracker. Three episodes barely give a show any time to find its footing, let alone build a dedicated audience. \"World of Quest\" had so much potential with its unique blend of humor and adventure. It deserved a fuller chance to unfold its story and characters.\n\n**RetroHeroFan**: Yeah, it felt like the show barely had a chance to breathe. I understand the industry is driven by ratings and ad revenue, but creativity and storytelling seem to have taken a back seat. It's disappointing for viewers who were just beginning to dive into the \"World of Quest\" universe.\n\n**4KidsConspiracy**: Makes you wonder about the decision-making process behind the scenes. Were they looking for instant hits without considering the long-term growth of a series? It's a tough climate for new shows trying to break through, and what happened to \"World of Quest\" is a stark example of this reality.\n\n**SpiderWebWatcher**: It's particularly frustrating when you think about how other series have had the opportunity to mature and develop over multiple seasons. There\u2019s a significant discrepancy in how shows are treated, and unfortunately, \"World of Quest\" fell on the harsher side of that divide.\n\n**AnimeKid1990**: And let's not forget the impact on the creators and animators who put their heart and soul into these projects, only to see them cut down almost immediately. It's got to be disheartening, and it sends a troubling message about the industry's commitment (or lack thereof) to creative storytelling.\n\n**ToonSpectator**: It's a loss for the animation community and for diversity in content. Every show axed prematurely is a missed opportunity for exploring new ideas and narratives in the animated medium. \u201cWorld of Quest\u201d might have opened the door for more adventurous, comical series if given the chance.\n\n**ActionFan321**: Is there a silver lining here, though? Perhaps the outcry over its rapid cancellation could influence how networks treat future series. Maybe, just maybe, it'll lead to a bit more patience and support for new concepts trying to find their audience.\n\n**RetroHeroFan**: One can hope, @ActionFan321. Meanwhile, for fans of the show and of animation in general, maybe it's time to get even more vocal about supporting the series we love, especially the new ones. Social media, fan forums, and direct feedback to networks could play a part in changing the narrative.\n\n**SpiderWebWatcher**: For now, we can only support other emerging shows and keep \"World of Quest\" alive in our discussions and fan communities. It's our way of showing that quality storytelling matters and deserves a chance to thrive.\n\n**ToonTracker**: Agreed, everyone. It\u2019s a tough pill to swallow, but this conversation highlights the importance of community support and advocacy for the shows we believe in. \"World of Quest\" may have had a short run, but it clearly left a lasting impression.

Have they announced who\u2019s behind the animation or any voice actors yet?\n\nAmoebaAmy: OMG, this made my day! I stumbled onto the news on Twitter but wasn\u2019t sure if it was real. I just hope they keep the charm of the comics. The sense of humor in Squish is just right for a cartoon!\n\nScienceRules45: @MicrobeMania I read that the team behind some of the recent popular cartoons is on board for this. As for voice actors, nothing\u2019s announced yet. I\u2019m crossing my fingers they get some quality talent. Hoping for some great chemistry between Squish, Pod, and Peggy. \ud83e\udd1e\n\nTheComicNerd21: True, voice acting can make or break a cartoon adaptation. I\u2019m a bit skeptical, tbh. Sometimes these transitions lose the spirit of the original material. But I\u2019ll reserve judgment until we get a trailer or something.\n\nArtsyOwl: Has anyone heard about the art style yet? The simplistic yet expressive style of the books is super charming. Kids WB tends to go for flashier animation, though I hope they keep it close to the spirit of the Squish comics.\n\nHappyMom200: I just hope they tackle the educational aspects well. My kids learned so much about microorganisms from these books while laughing their heads off. It\u2019ll be great for them to watch Squish\u2019s adventures!\n\nBioGeek: Yes! Education through entertainment is the best. I mean, who knew an amoeba could make science this fun? \ud83d\ude05 And considering we\u2019ve all become amateur virologists lately (thanks, 2020), the timing couldn\u2019t be better.\n\nGreenJelly223: For sure, @BioGeek. They have a chance here to really create something that\u2019s as informational as it is entertaining. I also love how the books touch on themes of friendship and acceptance. If they keep that intact, it\u2019s going to be a hit.\n\nMicrobeMania: Anybody have any insider scoop on when we might be getting a peek at the animation or the voice cast? I\u2019m super eager to see anything at this point!\n\nBacteriophage_: Rumors say a teaser might drop sometime in the spring. \ud83c\udf3c Keep your eyes peeled and your streaming devices ready!\n\nAmoebaAmy: Well, here\u2019s hoping Kids WB keeps the slime rolling! Can\u2019t wait to see our little squishy buddy in action. Let\u2019s keep this thread updated with any new info!\n\nAdmin5: This thread has been locked due to its inactivity over 30 days.

The Squish cartoon is set to premiere in mid-March! Clear your calendars and get ready for some amoeba action! Who\u2019s excited? \ud83c\udf89\n\nCartoonAficionado: Finally, some concrete dates! I\u2019ve been keeping an eye out since our last thread went quiet. Mid-March is sooner than I expected. Also heard about some schedule shake-ups. Looks like Apple and Onion is getting shelved for the Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Not sure how I feel about that one.\n\nAmoebaAmy: Squish is starting soon?! That\u2019s awesome! I\u2019m totally having a viewing party with my kids. But wow, Apple and Onion out for Xiaolin Showdown\u2026nostalgia trip, anyone? I did love that show, but it\u2019s a bit of a genre leap from Apple and Onion. \ud83c\udf00\n\nRestInToons: RIP The Tom and Jerry Show. Kinda saw that ending coming. And to be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May? I need new cartoons, not just rewinds. But Steven Universe is still a gem, at least. \ud83d\udc8e\n\nMicrobeMania: No more Tom and Jerry? That\u2019s the end of an era. Though, to be fair, SU reruns are solid. It\u2019s not every day you get a show that tackles heavy themes with magical aliens. Still, can\u2019t help but hope we get some fresh blood in the lineup eventually.\n\nScienceRules45: True, new content is key, but at least we have Squish! And with TTG, Gumball, and Johnny Test holding the fort as flagships, I think Kids WB has a pretty balanced mix. Squish might just be the breath of fresh air we need right now.\n\nGreenJelly223: So, mid-March for Squish, that\u2019s great! Does anyone know if that\u2019s going to affect TTG, Gumball, or Johnny Test air times? I know they\u2019re the heavy hitters, just hoping Squish gets a good slot that doesn\u2019t clash.\n\nTheComicNerd21: Haven\u2019t seen anything about time changes for the flagships. I reckon Squish will find its place without much issue. Kids WB tends to do well with scheduling around their mainstays. And let\u2019s face it\u2014TTG is practically unmovable at this point.\n\nHappyMom200: My kids will be over the moon with the return of Xiaolin Showdown. I loved it as a kid, too. It\u2019s going to be a mix of new and old at our house with Squish and the reruns. I think Kids WB might just pull off this balance. Still, hoping those reruns are just placeholders for future original content.\n\nArtsyOwl: I\u2019m just happy Squish is making its debut! Sure, schedule changes are always a bit of a rollercoaster, but that\u2019s the nature of TV, right? Out with the old, in with the new\u2026 and sometimes back in with the old! \ud83d\ude02\n\nAdmin5: Friendly reminder to keep industry rumor discussions civil. Looking forward to seeing how Squish is received by the community here! Let\u2019s revisit this thread after the premiere to share our thoughts. And, as always, stay tuned for any further schedule updates from Kids WB.\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up during the summer, The summer lineup has TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, Xiaolin Showdown, Johnny Test, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons and Craig of the Creek, Also, new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek and Johnny Test return in September\nThread Title: Kids WB Summer Lineup + Fall New Episodes Info! \u2600\ufe0f\ud83d\udcfa\n\nGreenJelly223: Summer\u2019s heating up, folks, and so is Kids WB\u2019s lineup! We\u2019re looking at TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, and Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Plus, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Craig of the Creek are all part of the mix. How\u2019s everyone feeling about the current programming?\n\nCartoonAficionado: Honestly, it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag, but I\u2019m not complaining! New fans are getting a taste of some classic toons with Xiaolin Showdown, and Squish has been a pleasant surprise\u2014really nailing it. Plus, Craig of the Creek is always solid. It\u2019s like a buffet of different cartoon flavors this summer.\n\nBacteriophage_: And don\u2019t forget what\u2019s coming in the fall \u2013 new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek, and Johnny Test. September can\u2019t come soon enough!\n\nAmoebaAmy: Squish has been an absolute delight! My kids adore it, and it\u2019s turning into our little summer tradition to watch together. As much as I love TTG and Gumball, it\u2019s Squish that has us tuning in with the most excitement.\n\nTheComicNerd21: A heads-up for all the true toon fans out there: new episodes for some of these shows are usually a blast. I\u2019ve got high hopes for the fall, especially for Craig of the Creek\u2014they\u2019ve been consistently knocking it out of the park.\n\nScienceRules45: I\u2019m just glad we have such variety. Keeps the channel interesting. Summer is always tricky with kids home all day, but this lineup has something for everybody.\n\nArtsyOwl: Agreed on the variety. The blend of classic and contemporary shows has me responding like I\u2019m five and thirteen all at once. \ud83d\ude06 By the way, the art in the latest season of Looney Tunes Cartoons has been stellar. Can\u2019t wait to see what they do next.\n\nMicrobeMania: I am surprised how well Skatoony holds up. It\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but the quizzing with cartoons is unique. And with Scooby Doo and Guess Who featured, it feels like we\u2019ve got a bit of a detective theme going on. Or is it just me?\n\nRestInToons: September seems pretty far, but I got a feeling that new Teen Titans Go and Johnny Test episodes will make some serious waves. Ben 10, too, has been gearing up for something big, at least that\u2019s the vibe.\n\nHappyMom200: It\u2019s a stable lineup for sure. Steven Universe reruns are still a hit in my house. Plus, I appreciate the educational value in shows like Squish. Keeps the kids learning even out of school\u2014parents\u2019 summer dream!\n\nAdmin5: Great to see such positivity about the lineup! As always, discuss your favorite shows, but please remember no spoilers for unaired episodes. Let\u2019s reconvene in this thread when the new episodes drop in September to share our thoughts and reviews!\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up where Robotboy is added to the schedule the next year in May 2022 when Summer begins, B10, LTC and SU are leaving, Robotboy, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks are taking their place, Also in the fall, we have a few new shows, Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the bold and Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated, Also a new acquired comedy cartoon about 2 blobs\nThread Title: Kids WB Schedule Shakeup - Hello Robotboy, So Long Ben 10 & Others! \ud83e\udd16\ud83d\udcfa\n\nGreenJelly223: Hold onto your remotes, toon fans! Coming up next in May 2022, just as summer kicks off, Kids WB is adding Robotboy to the lineup. It\u2019s a nostalgia hit for sure but sad to see some good ones like Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Steven Universe leave us. Thoughts?\n\nTheComicNerd21: Man, Robotboy brings me back. Haven\u2019t seen that little guy in AGES. Sad to see Ben 10 go; it was always a solid watch. But, this is the life of a cartoon fan, right? Out with the old, in with the\u2026 older? \ud83d\ude02\n\nBacteriophage_: Robotboy\u2019s return is quite a surprise. It had that classic boy-and-his-robot vibe. Also, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks? That\u2019s quite the throwback. For those who don\u2019t remember, Chop Socky Chooks was this wild mix of kung fu and chickens\u2014only in cartoons, folks!\n\nCartoonAficionado: Don\u2019t forget about the fall bonanza! Kids WB is loading up with some heavy hitters\u2014Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated. Plus, that new comedy about two blobs? Can\u2019t find much on it, but new content is always exciting!\n\nAmoebaAmy: Wait, so we\u2019re swapping out some superhero action with\u2026 different superhero action, and we\u2019re keeping the mystery with Scooby-Doo. And do I smell a strong comedy theme building up with the two blob cartoon?\n\nRestInToons: Totally digging the superhero update with Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. They bring that comic book essence to the screen. And another comedy about blobs? Guess this one\u2019s the era of the blob, huh?\n\nArtsyOwl: As much as I\u2019ll miss Steven Universe for its depth and progressivism, I guess I\u2019m ready for something light-hearted. Robotboy and the blob comedy might just be the palate cleanser we need. Here\u2019s hoping they deliver some good laughs!\n\nMicrobeMania: Definitely a bummer about Ben 10 and SU. Those shows had such depth in storytelling and character development. But Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated is not to be slept on. That iteration has some of the best arcs for our mystery-solving gang!\n\nScienceRules45: Batman: The Brave and the Bold was a gem! It didn\u2019t take itself too seriously and had just the right amount of camp. And with Ultimate Spider-Man, looks like we\u2019ll still be getting our fix of animated superhero action.\n\nHappyMom200: Love the move to Batman and Spider-Man. My kid has been on a real superhero kick, and Scooby-Doo never gets old. At least, not in my household. The blob comedy sounds intriguing\u2014Kids WB isn\u2019t afraid to experiment, that\u2019s for sure!\n\nAdmin5: With these cartoon cycles, it\u2019s always sad to see some shows go but equally exciting to welcome new titles and welcome back some classics like Robotboy. Remember, fall is just around the corner, so let\u2019s keep the conversation going when those new shows hit the screen.\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up where the blob cartoon is revealed to (be one I made up, hopefully I make it as a YouTube series) be named \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d Gloopy is a normal slime blob wheras Glitter lives up to her name as a sparkling one, Also, a mid season show Code Lyoko is premiering just as COTC knocks off for Summer, Also promos for CSC are already airing\nThread Title: Revealed: \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d Joins Kids WB + Code Lyoko Mid-Season Premiere!\u2728\ud83e\udd16\n\nCartoonAficionado: Alright, the mystery\u2019s solved! The new blob comedy coming to Kids WB is \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d. Gloopy is your average slime blob, and Glitter is, well, super sparkly! Could be a hit if it\u2019s done well. Fingers crossed it\u2019s as fun as the name suggests.\n\nGreenJelly223: \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,\u201d huh? That\u2019s quite the name! I\u2019m all for original content\u2014bringing in some fresh \u2018slime\u2019 to the game. Kudos to the creator, especially if they started on YouTube. That\u2019s one giant leap for slime-kind. \ud83d\ude04\n\nTheComicNerd21: Between Gloopy and Glitter, I\u2019m expecting some madcap hijinks and, hopefully, some good chemistry. Pun totally intended! It\u2019s neat seeing creators move from YouTube to big networks. What a time to be alive!\n\nBacteriophage_: Just saw the promo for Chop Socky Chooks! Honestly, I\u2019d forgotten about that show, but the nostalgia hit me hard. Kids WB really knows how to draw in the old school fans alongside the new ones.\n\nAmoebaAmy: Excited to see what \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d brings to the table! It\u2019s always refreshing to see new characters and stories. Also, did anyone catch that Code Lyoko is coming back as a mid-season show? That\u2019s unexpected! I remember watching that show as a kid\u2014the blend of 2D and 3D animation was so cool.\n\nRestInToons: Code Lyoko? No way! That show was my virtual escape. With Craig of the Creek taking a summer break, Code Lyoko has some big shoes to fill. I\u2019m cautiously optimistic. Also, kudos to the person behind \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d. This is indie creators\u2019 dream!\n\nArtsyOwl: Craig of the Creek is my comfort show, so knowing it\u2019s taking a break has me in my feels. But Code Lyoko might just be the perfect summer binge to replace it. That show was ahead of its time with its virtual world storyline.\n\nMicrobeMania: With Chop Socky Chooks, Code Lyoko, and now \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,\u201d I\u2019m sensing a theme of whimsy and adventure. Perfect for a carefree summer! It\u2019s gonna be a wild ride on Kids WB.\n\nScienceRules45: Indeed, summer is shaping up to be full of adventure and laughs! I\u2019m curious to see the comedic dynamics between Gloopy and Glitter and how they\u2019ll fit into the current lineup. Code Lyoko is an excellent addition for anyone who\u2019s into that sci-fi, virtual reality vibe.\n\nHappyMom200: Just peeped the promo for Gloopy and Glitter with the kids. They\u2019re already quoting lines and chuckling. Also, major props to Kids WB for the diversity in its programming\u2014you\u2019ve got old hits, modern takes, and now a homegrown web series making it to the big leagues.\n\nAdmin5: The summer is looking quite adventurous with all the fresh and returning programming we have on our hands! If \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d or Code Lyoko capture your hearts, be sure to come back and let everyone know. Enjoy the shows, everyone, and let\u2019s support those indie creators making waves!\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up where another mid-season show premieres, replacing Gumball, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\nThread Title: Mid-Season Update: The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Replace Gumball on Kids WB! \ud83e\udd29\ud83c\udfaa\n\nTheComicNerd21: Big news for Kids WB watchers! \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d is premiering mid-season, taking the spot \u201cThe Amazing World of Gumball\u201d left behind. I\u2019ve got high hopes that these thrill-seeking siblings will bring the same level of zany to the lineup. Can they live up to the hilarity of Gumball, though? That\u2019s the big question.\n\nGreenJelly223: Gumball\u2019s out?! Say it isn\u2019t so! That show was a staple! But I remember The Adrenalini Brothers from awhile back\u2026they were full of over-the-top stunts and accents. Hopefully, they can fill the quirky cartoon void that\u2019s gonna be left in Gumball\u2019s wake.\n\nCartoonAficionado: \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d are pure comedic gold with those daredevil antics. Gumball set a high bar for humor and heart, but if you want outrageous adventures and laughs, the Adrenalinis could be just the ticket.\n\nArtsyOwl: I admit, I\u2019ll miss the random humor and clever writing of Gumball. It was one of those shows that had something for viewers of all ages. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have a different flavor, but I\u2019m definitely willing to give them a shot.\n\nBacteriophage_: Well folks, all good things must come to an end, but at least the high-paced energy of The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers might fill the void. They\u2019re not new to the cartoon scene, but let\u2019s hope their stunts are as amazing as ever.\n\nMicrobeMania: \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d is a throwback! Those guys pull off some wild stunts. Kids WB seems to be aiming for high octane to take Gumball\u2019s place. Keeping my fingers crossed that they keep delivering fresh content, even in the form of older gems getting the spotlight again.\n\nRestInToons: Guess it\u2019s goodbye to Gumball and hello Adrenalini. I remember the brothers having quite the international flair. Their eclectic style should make for a refreshing change of pace. Plus, with Squish and the others, Kids WB\u2019s variety is still on point.\n\nAmoebaAmy: My kids loved Gumball, so they\u2019re a bit gutted. But I think The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u2019 daredevil acts might just win them over. I\u2019m always down for more shenanigans. Here\u2019s hoping they get as much character-driven hilarity as Gumball had.\n\nScienceRules45: Gumball\u2019s creativity was unmatched, but The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers? That\u2019s a nostalgia trip! Will be interesting to see how a show that\u2019s been off the radar for a while resonates with the current audience.\n\nHappyMom200: My Gumball marathon nights are coming to an end it seems. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have some big shoes to fill, but I\u2019m ready for the laughs. In Kids WB we trust, right? \ud83d\ude02\n\nAdmin5: Change is part of every TV network\u2019s lifecycle. \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d could be what kids WB needs to shake things up.

Code Lyoko has secured its spot on the schedule, which I know some of you are thrilled about. The Amazing World of Gumball and Craig of the Creek are making a short-lived comeback, dipping out again in January. Can\u2019t get enough of those two, so I\u2019m here for any time they\u2019re on.\n\nCartoonAficionado: Great to have Gumball and Craig back, even if it\u2019s just for a quick hello and goodbye. It\u2019s like that favorite seasonal dish you can\u2019t stop craving. And Code Lyoko sticking around? Love that for us\u2014those virtual vibes aren\u2019t going anywhere!\n\nTheComicNerd21: Ah, the temporary returns of Gumball and Craig are bittersweet. Makes you wish they\u2019d just stick around full-time. But, I gotta say, Code Lyoko keeping its slot is A-okay with me. That\u2019s one show I\u2019ve been seriously getting back into.\n\nArtsyOwl: The quality storytelling in Craig of the Creek will be sorely missed once January rolls around. And Gumball\u2014it just has that rewatchability factor like no other. Soak it up while you can, folks!\n\nMicrobeMania: Just dropping in to say that Skatoony is going to be back next summer, and I\u2019m here for it! It\u2019s kind of become the unofficial summer tradition since 2018, hasn\u2019t it? Always great to see a show that knows how to fill its seasonal shoes.\n\nBacteriophage_: Yeah, Skatoony\u2019s like that cool summer camp you get excited about all year. But let\u2019s not overlook the fall newcomers too\u2014I\u2019m already setting reminders for Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The superhero binge is real!\n\nRestInToons: Mixed feelings about the short-term return of Gumball and Craig of the Creek. At least we know Kids WB is good at giving us something to look forward to. As for Code Lyoko, it\u2019s been interesting to see a show from yesteryear find its groove with the audience today.\n\nAmoebaAmy: The limited time with Gumball and Craig is better than no time! Let\u2019s enjoy the laughs and adventures while they last. And happy to have confirmed scoops like the one about Skatoony return\u2014it\u2019s this kind of knowledge that keeps the fandom ticking.\n\nScienceRules45: I\u2019ve gotten used to the shift and shuffle of Kids WB\u2019s schedule. You learn to appreciate what you\u2019ve got when you\u2019ve got it. That said, I\u2019m diving headfirst into the nostalgia and newness of this fall\u2019s lineup. It\u2019s going to be an entertaining season!\n\nHappyMom200: I\u2019m grateful for any sprinkles of Craig of the Creek episodes we get! It\u2019s such a gem. And does anyone else get way too competitive watching Skatoony, or is that just me? \ud83d\ude02 Super stoked about its return next year!\n\nAdmin5: Some very astute observations and a tangible excitement for the new and returning shows this fall!

As we hit the sunny stride of 2023, Kids WB is switching up the schedule. We\u2019re saying bye to Batman, Scooby, and Spidey. But don\u2019t despair\u2014Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest, and the ever-reliable Skatoony are here for those summer vibes. Also, \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d are still doing the rerun rounds. Keeping it fresh and funky!\n\nCartoonAficionado: Honestly, it\u2019s cool to see Ozzy & Drix making a comeback. That show was always under the radar but it delivered some solid laughs plus a bit of body-function education. Let\u2019s see how it holds up today!\n\nTheComicNerd21: No more Batman and Spidey is a bummer, but you know what? Bring on the Ozzy & Drix and World of Quest! I remember World of Quest being pretty out there with its humor, a good mix of action and oddball characters\u2014definitely fitting for the wacky tone of summer.\n\nMicrobeMania: Ozzy & Drix, that\u2019s a throwback! I had a feeling it could make a resurgence. Educational and entertaining\u2014that\u2019s a tough balance to strike, but that show had it. Also, cheers to year 5 of summer Skatoony\u2014it\u2019s tradition at this point!\n\nArtsyOwl: Hey, \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d are still in the reruns, too! Shimmering on\u2014quite literally, thanks to Glitter. It\u2019s a quirky and cute show, glad it\u2019s still around for the little ones to enjoy.\n\nBacteriophage_: Seeing World of Quest drop into the lineup makes me hopeful that Kids WB is dedicated to keeping variety alive. Adventure, humor, outright weirdness\u2014it\u2019s got it all. And combined with the educational fun from Ozzy & Drix, plus the game show laughs from Skatoony? Count me in for the summer!\n\nRestInToons: Sayonara superheroes! This season\u2019s lineup shows that kids\u2019 programming isn\u2019t just about capes and villains. It\u2019s about variety, surprise, and a touch of nostalgia. Let\u2019s get microscopic with Ozzy & Drix and go on a wild ride with Quest and Nestor!\n\nAmoebaAmy: Always a tad sad to see the Scooby gang go, but switching up genres keeps things interesting. Ozzy & Drix is kind of like \u201cThe Magic School Bus\u201d for the older crowd, and I\u2019m here for it! Plus, Skatoony is something my kids look forward to every year\u2014glad it\u2019s not going anywhere!\n\nScienceRules45: I\u2019ve got to say, I appreciate how Kids WB keeps mixing in educational content amidst all the comedy and action. Ozzy & Drix is a blast from the past that I\u2019m excited to revisit. It\u2019s just what we need in a world that could use a refresher on health and the human body!\n\nHappyMom200: World of Quest is an underrated treasure, and I\u2019m thrilled it\u2019s coming back into the spotlight. It\u2019s like that fun summer book series but animated. And Skatoony is practically synonymous with summer now; glad to know some things stay solid.\n\nAdmin5: The summer outlook is looking diverse and delightful! With shows that cater to every kind of young fan, there\u2019s no shortage of entertainment. Let\u2019s keep track of these changes and see how they fare in the warm months ahead. Enjoy your summer watching, and stay tuned for updates on what\u2019s next!\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a tweet where a character does the Summer promo\n\ud83c\udfac\ud83c\udf1f Roll out the red carpet for summer on Kids WB! \ud83c\udf1e\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Tune in with #OzzyAndDrix as Ozzy himself gives you the inside scoop on the sizzling summer lineup! \ud83e\udd29\ud83d\udd2c From microscopic missions to epic quests and game show antics with #Skatoony, your summer is about to get a mega dose of FUN! \ud83c\udfd6\ufe0f\ud83d\udc7e #SummerToonsWB.\n\nJanuary 27 2024\n\nShould have seen this coming the day TAWOG and COTC left for good, but Kids WB died on December 30, We now have the CW4Kids, owned by 4Kids Entertainment, and the first schedule change has happened, Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have been replaced with Pokemon: Indigo League and Sonic X respectively, The block still has the Kids WB aesthetic, but I expect that to be gone by Easter, Also, another schedule change is coming in a few months, Teen Titans Go, Scooby Doo Mystery Inc and Batman the Brave and the Bold are being replaced with GoGoRiki (Smeshariki), Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya in 2 weeks, The remaining KWB shows as of now are Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider Man (and in 2 weeks, Gloopy and Glitter). The way they went about this was interesting, In December they started airing promos saying that from January 7 the network would be changing it\u2019s name, it didn\u2019t tell us that 4Kids are now in charge or that there would be new shows, the promo just showed the usual KWB shows like Squish, TAAB, TTG, XS, etc. Also today the promo for the next schedule change (dubbed a Super Duper Late Winter Lineup) has a new slogan \u201cYou\u2019re signed on to the CW4Kids\u201d Slow and painful rebrand? \ud83d\ude12, If you\u2019re not gonna change the bumpers untill Easter then why reveal your flashy new slogan now. Also the website (thecw4kids.com) STILL says this at the footer \u201c\u00a9 2024 Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Global, Nexstar Media Group\u201d Hopefully it is updated to reflect 4Kids\u2019s involvement soon. Write a follow up forum convo where they talk more about the slow transition, and that GoGoRiki is cute, and that it could be primed to take over most of the current comedy cartoons\nThread Title: CW4Kids: A Slow Transition & The Future of Cartoons on the Block? \ud83d\udd04\ud83d\udcfa\n\nToonMasterJay: So, has anyone else noticed how the CW4Kids transition is kinda like watching paint dry? The bumpers feel like Kids WB is haunting us. And they\u2019re dropping their new slogan already, but the website footer is still all about the old guard\u2026 Mixed signals much?\n\nDigitalToonFan: Yeah, the transition is definitely dragging its feet. I mean, if you\u2019re going to bring in 4Kids, then do it with a bang! Not this half-Zoom half-real-life meeting vibe. The new lineup switches could be cool though, but I\u2019ll miss Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers for sure.\n\nGoGoFan223: Honestly, I\u2019m most excited about GoGoRiki (or Smeshariki for the purists). It\u2019s cute and has that potential to be big with the comedy crowd. Less about the action and more laughs\u2014could be the perfect fit for the new direction they\u2019re aiming for.\n\nSonicXforever: Still processing the swap of Squish for Pok\u00e9mon and TAAB for Sonic X\u2026 I mean, sure, classics! But Sonic X has been rerun how many times now? I guess they\u2019re banking on that nostalgia factor to reel us in while they\u2019re redecorating.\n\nPokeNostalgia101: Not going to lie, I\u2019m excited to have Pok\u00e9mon Indigo League back\u2014it\u2019s like comfort food for my soul. But I hear you all, the change is weirdly slow. I get that it\u2019s a big shift from Kids WB to full-on 4Kids ownership, yet you\u2019d think they\u2019d want to make their mark quick.\n\nLyokoLover: Low-key glad Code Lyoko and Xiaolin Showdown are sticking around. They\u2019ve got that unique appeal that isn\u2019t easy to replace. But curious how long till that changes with this new \u201cSuper Duper Late Winter Lineup.\u201d If they\u2019re ushering out TTG and Scooby, who\u2019s next?\n\nAnimanga4Life: Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya coming to the block brings back fond Saturday morning memories! Although, I do get why some are skeptical; a lot of these shows have seen multiple reruns over the years.\n\nWebWader: I keep checking the website hoping it\u2019s been updated\u2026 No dice. The weird blend of old and new branding isn\u2019t helping anyone. At least update the footer to show 4Kids is steering the ship now. How hard can it be?\n\nComicStripKid: The lineup change feels like a balance between targeting the parents who grew up with these shows and trying to appeal to the new gen of cartoon fans. GoGoRiki\u2019s charm and simplicity could be their ticket into the latter\u2019s hearts. I see a mascot in the making.\n\nToonTalker91: Not thrilled about the slow pace here. It\u2019s like we\u2019re stuck in Kids WB limbo. I miss the days when a rebrand meant a fresh start, not this lingering goodbye. Curious how Gloopy and Glitter will fare with the rest of the changes looming\u2026 Will they be the last ones standing?\n\nAdmin_4KidsRevamp: Please bear with us during this transition. We\u2019re working hard to bring a fresh and exciting lineup while honoring the legacy of what came before. Believe us, it\u2019ll be worth the wait! Stay tuned for more updates and enjoy the shows in the meantime.\n\nThread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp\nWrite a follow up in mid Feb where the Feb lineup is here, 5 4Kids shows (Pokemon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby and GoGoRiki) and 5 Kids WB shows (Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter and Code Lyoko) Also, the website now has an account and points system, games, and has updated the footer to \u201c\u00a9 2024 4Kids Entertainment\u201d, Website otherwise remains the same, and still has show pages for removed shows, but this will slowly change in the coming weeks\nThread Title: CW4Kids Mid-Feb Lineup is Live!

It\u2019s a mix of eras in one block!\n\nToonMasterJay: Checked out the CW4Kids website, they finally ditched the old footer. It\u2019s official, this ship is sailing under the 4Kids flag now. Nice to see they\u2019re stepping up their game with accounts and points, plus some games to boot!\n\nAnimanga4Life: 4Kids moving in with accounts and points? Sounds like they\u2019re setting up a cool rewards system. And that might just get more kids invested in the website beyond streaming shows\u2014a savvy move.\n\nGoGoFan223: GoGoRiki getting prime time with the big 4Kids dogs is great news. Its cute factor is off the charts. Could be the one to round out the new vibe CW4Kids is going for if they play their cards right.\n\nSonicXforever: Glad to see Sonic racing into the lineup. It\u2019s about time he got back into the limelight. Now to see how he fares among the newer offerings. Talk about a speed battle!\n\nPokeNostalgia101: Pok\u00e9mon getting its rightful place has me all fired up! But it\u2019s kinda odd to still see show pages for the ousted shows on the website. Anyone else notice that? Hopefully, they\u2019ll clear that up soon.\n\nLyokoLover: The fact that Code Lyoko is sticking around amidst all the changes shows its resilience. Maybe 4Kids recognizes the gold they have with some of these Kids WB shows. The perfect yin to their yang.\n\nComicStripKid: Well, can\u2019t say 4Kids isn\u2019t taking a balanced approach to this transition. Keeping half the lineup from Kids WB seems like a strategic way to ensure they don\u2019t lose the existing audience while they woo new viewers with nostalgia and updated features.\n\nWebWader: The website is getting there, slowly but surely. With account functionality and games, it looks like 4Kids is channeling some vintage interactivity magic. Here\u2019s to mission: engage the digitally-savvy generation!\n\nToonTalker91: Seeing \u201c\u00a9 2024 4Kids Entertainment\u201d at the bottom of the website gives me mixed emotions\u2014it\u2019s good to see they\u2019re updating stuff, but the nostalgia for Kids WB is real. Any bets on how long Gloopy and Glitter can hold out?\n\nAdmin_4KidsRevamp: Thanks for sticking with us through the changes!

Plus, line-up\u2019s getting shaken up again\u2014big time!\n\nDigitalToonFan: Heard the scoop that Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, and Ultimate Spider Man are waving goodbye. But we\u2019re keeping the virtual adventures of Code Lyoko and the quirky \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d\u2014two survivors of the cull.\n\nAnimanga4Life: For the manga/anime fans, Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series is swooping in to replace the original Pok\u00e9mon series! Exciting to see some new journeys and battles. Gotta love the continuous evolution of the Pok\u00e9mon franchise on the CW4Kids.\n\nGoGoFan223: And what about that triple threat joining the fray? Chaotic, TMNT: Back to the Sewer, and Viva Pi\u00f1ata are about to spice things up! Feels like 4Kids is tossing in as many flavors as they can to see what sticks.\n\nSonicXforever: Greatest thing about CW4Kids right now? They\u2019re not afraid to mix it up. The digital look update has me hyped\u2014it\u2019s like the block is leveling up. Hopefully, it adds a fresh vibe that resonates with the digital generation.\n\nPokeNostalgia101: Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series will def pull in the crowd looking for that cutting-edge anime action. Pok\u00e9mon always knows how to keep things fresh.\n\nLyokoLover: Sad to see some old friends go, but Code Lyoko holding strong gives me hope. It\u2019s like our own little slice of stability in this whirlwind of changes.\n\nComicStripKid: With the digital online style coming, CW4Kids is clearly gunning for a certain look and feel. Let\u2019s just cross our fingers it blends seamlessly with the cartoon essence we all tune in for.\n\nWebWader: Do you think bringing in Chaotic, TMNT, and Viva Pi\u00f1ata is going too far back into the vault? I\u2019m all for nostalgia, but I hope they still invest in newer properties or original content. Balance is key.\n\nToonTalker91: Big stuff with Pok\u00e9mon Horizons; it\u2019s been creating buzz all over! As for Chaotic and TMNT: Back to the Sewer, that\u2019s unexpected! Not so sure what to expect from Viva Pi\u00f1ata, though\u2026 a wildcard entry, I\u2019d say.\n\nAdmin_4KidsRevamp: Expect the unexpected with CW4Kids! We\u2019re committed to delivering a modern digital vibe with the shows you love, new and old.

Looks like One Piece (yup, the infamous 4Kids dub) is joining CW4Kids in July. Are we saying goodbye to Viva Pi\u00f1ata, then? Seems like it\u2019s walking the plank for our pirate crew to come aboard.\n\nToonMasterJay: One Piece making a comeback? That\u2019s a blast from the past! 4Kids really diving deep into the nostalgia ocean here. Viva Pi\u00f1ata was sweet, but I guess it\u2019s time for some high-seas adventures. Just to be clear, though, this is NOT hitting Code Lyoko or Gloopy and Glitter, right? Those two seem to be our CW4Kids mainstays now.\n\nGoGoFan223: I\u2019m all in for One Piece (4Kids dub quirks and all), but let\u2019s spare a moment for Viva Pi\u00f1ata. That show was way more than just candy and gardens\u2014had its own charm. But hey, pirates vs. pi\u00f1atas? Pirates always win, I guess.\n\nSonicXforever: Ahoy, mateys! One Piece\u2019s arrival is definitely going to shake things up. Can\u2019t wait to see how it fits with the CW4Kids digital look. Curious though, how the dub will hold up in today\u2019s time\u2014infamous or not, it\u2019s part of the grand anime voyage.\n\nPokeNostalgia101: Bold move bringing back One Piece, especially the 4Kids version. Will it replace Viva Pi\u00f1ata? Seems likely. At the very least, it'll inject some high-energy action into the lineup. Just no touching Code Lyoko or Gloopy and Glitter\u2014those are in a league of their own on this block.\n\nLyokoLover: Glad to see there\u2019s some untouchable status for Code Lyoko and Gloopy and Glitter amidst all these changes. And the return of One Piece? Time to set sail with nostalgia. Just hope the kids can appreciate its... unique charm.\n\nComicStripKid: The idea of the One Piece (4Kids dub) hitting the CW4Kids waves is something else. I\u2019m here for it, but wave goodbye to Viva Pi\u00f1ata gently. That show had its fans too. Still, there\u2019s something about pirates that just screams adventure. Let\u2019s see where this ship sails!\n\nWebWader: With One Piece's arrival, CW4Kids is showing it's not afraid to mix and match its lineup for a broad appeal. As for Viva Pi\u00f1ata... it was a good run. But let\u2019s face it, pirates are timeless. Here\u2019s hoping the mix keeps bringing diverse viewers to the channel.\n\nToonTalker91: The 4Kids One Piece dub is legendary\u2014for better or worse. Its return could either be a hit or miss with today\u2019s audience.

First off, we're getting a reboot of \"Inspector Gadget.\" Can you believe it? I have such fond memories of the original. Wonder how the reboot will compare.\n\n**User2**: \"Inspector Gadget\" reboot? That's news to me, and fantastic news at that! The original was my childhood. I hope they keep the charm of the original while giving it a fresh spin. But hey, did you read about \"The Owl & Co\"? Sounds like a quirky show\u2014about a bad luck owl and his annoying neighbors. Could be a fun, light-hearted series.\n\n**User3**: \"The Owl & Co\" seems like a fresh concept, at least. I'm curious about how they'll handle the humor considering it\u2019s centered around bad luck. Has potential to be either a hit or a miss.

I wonder if they\u2019ll stick to the original's slapstick comedy style. It\u2019s a blast from the past I'm eager to see. But, does anyone have thoughts on \"Doraemon\" joining the lineup? That's quite a leap from their usual fare, considering it\u2019s a beloved Japanese series. I'm all for diversifying the lineup with different styles of animation.\n\n**User5**: \"Doraemon\" is honestly the most intriguing addition for me. It's a huge hit worldwide, and seeing it join Boomerang UK could introduce the series to a whole new audience here. The mixture of comedy and sci-fi elements is unique on the channel.

But I've noticed other countries have started adopting a new branding style\u2014this very minimalist B&W box logo that looks a lot like Cartoon Network's, and their environment is all about CYMV colors, again borrowing from CN. Does anyone else feel a bit uneasy that we might lose our beloved branding by the end of the year? Also, any word on when the new shows are hitting our screen?\n\n**ClassicToonLover**: Totally get what you're saying, @BlueLineFanatic. I've seen those new designs, and while change can be good, our current branding just has so much character! It sets Boomerang apart. It's funky, it's fun\u2014it's Boomerang! The rebrand to something so minimalist feels like we might lose a bit of our identity. Haven't heard about the new shows, though. Hopefully, someone has some info.\n\n**DigitalDuck**: I'm actually a bit excited about the CYMV color scheme, but you do have a point about the uniqueness of our current branding. There's something special about it that's hard to replicate with minimalistic designs. I think the swirling blue line and the lively mix of animals and aliens give Boomerang a welcoming vibe that's hard to beat. No news on my end about the new shows, but fingers crossed they announce something soon!\n\n**RetroRaven**: I'll be honest, I'm all for keeping things the way they are. The current branding feels like a breath of fresh air amid all the minimalism taking over every other channel. It's like Boomerang is this colourful oasis that refuses to give in. Maybe it's just nostalgia talking, but isn't that what Boomerang's all about? Capturing that essence of fun and laughter from our favorite cartoons. Regarding new shows, I'm stumped too. Hopefully, they keep the spirit alive with whatever they bring to the table.\n\n**FlamingoFiesta**: As much as I love our current branding, I think a refresh could bring in new viewers. Maybe there's a way to merge the minimalist approach with the playful essence we all love. That said, I do worry about losing those distinct elements that make Boomerang, well, Boomerang. About the new shows, I wish there was more transparency on when they're planning to release them. The suspense is killing me!\n\n**MoleHillWatcher**: It'd be a shame to see the swirling blue line go. There's something almost magical about it, like it's drawing you into another world\u2014a world where the fun never stops, and all your favorite characters await. I get the need for branding updates, but I hope they find a way to retain that magic. On the new shows, I'm scratching tunnels in anticipation here. Boomerang, give us something to look forward to, please!\n\n**AdminCartoonBuff**: Hey, everyone! Truly fascinating discussion going on. While we don't have any official word yet on the branding or new shows, your passion for keeping Boomerang unique and lively is clear. These forums are a great way to share your love and hopes for the channel's future, and who knows, maybe the big wigs are listening! Let's keep our fingers crossed for an announcement soon, and in the meantime, let\u2019s cherish the branding we've grown to love. Branding evolves, but our love for these characters and stories remains constant.

The first of the new shows has officially been announced, and it's coming sooner than we thought. I caught the end of the promo, and there's a LOT to unpack, especially regarding our branding discussion. Before I dive into that, the new show is called \"Galactic Adventures of Zoom & Zany\" and it looks absolutely OUT OF THIS WORLD! \ud83c\udf0c They've got aliens, space races, and all kinds of cosmic mayhem. \n\nBut here's the kicker: at the end of the promo, they used BOTH branding styles. It starts with that minimalist B&W box logo we talked about, kinda sleek and modern, but then\u2014boom! It transitions into our beloved, swirling blue line morphing into the colorful, classic Boomerang logo, complete with a cheerful flamingo and a mischievous mole popping up! They even added a futuristic touch fitting the theme of the show.\n\n**ClassicToonLover**: Wow, @BlueLineFanatic! \ud83d\ude0d I was on the fence about the branding changes, but combining the new and the classic? That sounds like a visual treat! I'm so relieved they're keeping the essence of our lively Boomerang while embracing the new direction. And \"Galactic Adventures of Zoom & Zany\"? Count me in! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**DigitalDuck**: That\u2019s a relief! I was worried the new minimalist style might overshadow what makes Boomerang special. But incorporating elements from both brandings? Genius move! Shows they're paying attention to what fans love while still evolving. Can't wait to see how \"Galactic Adventures of Zoom & Zany\" introduces this clever blend. \ud83c\udf20\n\n**RetroRaven**: Honestly, that's the best outcome we could've hoped for. It respects the nostalgia factor while appealing to newer audiences with the clean, modern look. Plus, a space-themed show sounds like a fresh direction for Boomerang. This might just be the perfect launch (pun intended) for the \"new\" Boomerang. \ud83e\ude90\n\n**FlamingoFiesta**: Perfect solution! The ending branding style of the promo sounds like a love letter to long-time fans and a warm welcome to new ones. It's innovative without losing its heart. And a show about galactic adventures? Sign me up! Boomerang's looking bright, just like the stars of \"Galactic Adventures of Zoom & Zany.\" \u2728\n\n**MoleHillWatcher**: This is the news I've been digging for! Mixing the branding styles is a smart move, and it sounds visually striking. If they apply this thoughtful approach to their show lineup as well, we're in for a treat. \"Galactic Adventures of Zoom & Zany\" is just the beginning, and I'm here for the ride. \ud83c\udf1f\n\n**AdminCartoonBuff**: Thrilled to hear all the excitement, everyone! \"Galactic Adventures of Zoom & Zany\" is just the start of a new era for Boomerang, blending the best of both worlds. Your enthusiasm and love for the channel have been loud and clear. Let's continue to support the shows and celebrate the evolved yet familiar Boomerang we cherish.

After the amazing kickoff with \"Galactic Adventures of Zoom & Zany,\" I can't help but wonder about the other new shows we've been buzzing about - \"Inspector Gadget\" (IG), \"The Owl & Co\" (TO&C), \"George of the Jungle\" (GOTJ), \"Doraemon\" (D), and \"World of Quest\" (WOQ). Any updates from anyone? Also, any more clarity on the whole branding situation? \n\nJust as I was typing this out, Boomerang dropped another promo featuring snippets from the upcoming shows, but still no specific release dates. \n\n**AdminCartoonBuff**: Hi @BlueLineFanatic and everyone! Great news on both fronts. Let's start with the shows - \"Inspector Gadget,\" \"The Owl & Co,\" \"George of the Jungle,\" \"Doraemon,\" and \"World of Quest\" are all slated for a roll-out across the next several months. We\u2019re finalizing the schedule and will announce dates soon. Each show brings its unique flavor to Boomerang, staying true to our blend of nostalgia and fresh, engaging content.\n\nOn the branding front, there's been a bit of a development. We've listened to our fans and have decided the full rebrand to the minimalist B&W box will not happen for TV. However, we do see the value in refreshing our look for the digital age, so this new design will be used specifically for our Web app interface. On TV, we'll continue with the existing, colorful line writing that everyone loves. We believe this approach respects our heritage while making strides into the digital future.\n\n**ClassicToonLover**: That's incredible news, @AdminCartoonBuff! Keeping the classic branding on TV while updating the Web app makes a lot of sense. It's a great compromise. And I'm thrilled to hear the new shows are coming soon. Can't wait to see how they've updated \"Inspector Gadget\" and \"George of the Jungle\" in particular!\n\n**DigitalDuck**: Thanks for the clarity, @AdminCartoonBuff. The decision on the branding is reassuring. There\u2019s something special about turning on the TV and seeing that iconic Boomerang style. Plus, modernizing the app is a smart move. Looking forward to checking out \"Doraemon\" and the rest!\n\n**RetroRaven**: Absolutely the best news, @AdminCartoonBuff. Keeping what works and innovating where it makes sense - Boomerang really knows its audience. The lineup sounds fantastic, and I'm especially curious about \"The Owl & Co.\" Bring on the laughs and adventures!\n\n**FlamingoFiesta**: A big thank you for listening to the fans, @AdminCartoonBuff! The Web app update seems like a fresh way to appeal to newer audiences without alienating the core fans. Also, super excited for \"World of Quest\" \u2013 it sounds like an epic addition to Boomerang's lineup!\n\n**MoleHillWatcher**: Cheers for the update, @AdminCartoonBuff!

Mid-Season Madness \ud83d\udc1b\ud83d\udcda\n\nGreenJelly223: Hey Squish fans! Did you guys hear the news? There\u2019s a Squish cartoon in the works and it\u2019s hitting Kids WB\u2019s mid-season lineup! Can\u2019t wait to see our favorite amoeba make the jump from page to screen! \ud83d\ude04\n\nMicrobeMania: No way, this is awesome! Squish has been one of my favorite graphic novel series for my kids. They\u2019re going to freak out! Have they announced who\u2019s behind the animation or any voice actors yet?\n\nAmoebaAmy: OMG, this made my day! I stumbled onto the news on Twitter but wasn\u2019t sure if it was real. I just hope they keep the charm of the comics. The sense of humor in Squish is just right for a cartoon!\n\nScienceRules45: @MicrobeMania I read that the team behind some of the recent popular cartoons is on board for this. As for voice actors, nothing\u2019s announced yet. I\u2019m crossing my fingers they get some quality talent. Hoping for some great chemistry between Squish, Pod, and Peggy. \ud83e\udd1e\n\nTheComicNerd21: True, voice acting can make or break a cartoon adaptation. I\u2019m a bit skeptical, tbh. Sometimes these transitions lose the spirit of the original material. But I\u2019ll reserve judgment until we get a trailer or something.\n\nArtsyOwl: Has anyone heard about the art style yet? The simplistic yet expressive style of the books is super charming. Kids WB tends to go for flashier animation, though I hope they keep it close to the spirit of the Squish comics.\n\nHappyMom200: I just hope they tackle the educational aspects well. My kids learned so much about microorganisms from these books while laughing their heads off. It\u2019ll be great for them to watch Squish\u2019s adventures!\n\nBioGeek: Yes! Education through entertainment is the best. I mean, who knew an amoeba could make science this fun? \ud83d\ude05 And considering we\u2019ve all become amateur virologists lately (thanks, 2020), the timing couldn\u2019t be better.\n\nGreenJelly223: For sure, @BioGeek. They have a chance here to really create something that\u2019s as informational as it is entertaining. I also love how the books touch on themes of friendship and acceptance. If they keep that intact, it\u2019s going to be a hit.\n\nMicrobeMania: Anybody have any insider scoop on when we might be getting a peek at the animation or the voice cast? I\u2019m super eager to see anything at this point!\n\nBacteriophage_: Rumors say a teaser might drop sometime in the spring. \ud83c\udf3c Keep your eyes peeled and your streaming devices ready!\n\nAmoebaAmy: Well, here\u2019s hoping Kids WB keeps the slime rolling!

I\u2019ve been keeping an eye out since our last thread went quiet. Mid-March is sooner than I expected. Also heard about some schedule shake-ups. Looks like Apple and Onion is getting shelved for the Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Not sure how I feel about that one.\n\nAmoebaAmy: Squish is starting soon?! That\u2019s awesome! I\u2019m totally having a viewing party with my kids. But wow, Apple and Onion out for Xiaolin Showdown\u2026nostalgia trip, anyone? I did love that show, but it\u2019s a bit of a genre leap from Apple and Onion. \ud83c\udf00\n\nRestInToons: RIP The Tom and Jerry Show. Kinda saw that ending coming. And to be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May? I need new cartoons, not just rewinds. But Steven Universe is still a gem, at least. \ud83d\udc8e\n\nMicrobeMania: No more Tom and Jerry? That\u2019s the end of an era. Though, to be fair, SU reruns are solid. It\u2019s not every day you get a show that tackles heavy themes with magical aliens. Still, can\u2019t help but hope we get some fresh blood in the lineup eventually.\n\nScienceRules45: True, new content is key, but at least we have Squish! And with TTG, Gumball, and Johnny Test holding the fort as flagships, I think Kids WB has a pretty balanced mix. Squish might just be the breath of fresh air we need right now.\n\nGreenJelly223: So, mid-March for Squish, that\u2019s great! Does anyone know if that\u2019s going to affect TTG, Gumball, or Johnny Test air times? I know they\u2019re the heavy hitters, just hoping Squish gets a good slot that doesn\u2019t clash.\n\nTheComicNerd21: Haven\u2019t seen anything about time changes for the flagships. I reckon Squish will find its place without much issue. Kids WB tends to do well with scheduling around their mainstays. And let\u2019s face it\u2014TTG is practically unmovable at this point.\n\nHappyMom200: My kids will be over the moon with the return of Xiaolin Showdown. I loved it as a kid, too. It\u2019s going to be a mix of new and old at our house with Squish and the reruns. I think Kids WB might just pull off this balance. Still, hoping those reruns are just placeholders for future original content.\n\nArtsyOwl: I\u2019m just happy Squish is making its debut! Sure, schedule changes are always a bit of a rollercoaster, but that\u2019s the nature of TV, right? Out with the old, in with the new\u2026 and sometimes back in with the old! \ud83d\ude02\n\nAdmin5: Friendly reminder to keep industry rumor discussions civil.

New fans are getting a taste of some classic toons with Xiaolin Showdown, and Squish has been a pleasant surprise\u2014really nailing it. Plus, Craig of the Creek is always solid. It\u2019s like a buffet of different cartoon flavors this summer.\n\nBacteriophage_: And don\u2019t forget what\u2019s coming in the fall \u2013 new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek, and Johnny Test. September can\u2019t come soon enough!\n\nAmoebaAmy: Squish has been an absolute delight! My kids adore it, and it\u2019s turning into our little summer tradition to watch together. As much as I love TTG and Gumball, it\u2019s Squish that has us tuning in with the most excitement.\n\nTheComicNerd21: A heads-up for all the true toon fans out there: new episodes for some of these shows are usually a blast. I\u2019ve got high hopes for the fall, especially for Craig of the Creek\u2014they\u2019ve been consistently knocking it out of the park.\n\nScienceRules45: I\u2019m just glad we have such variety. Keeps the channel interesting. Summer is always tricky with kids home all day, but this lineup has something for everybody.\n\nArtsyOwl: Agreed on the variety. The blend of classic and contemporary shows has me responding like I\u2019m five and thirteen all at once. \ud83d\ude06 By the way, the art in the latest season of Looney Tunes Cartoons has been stellar. Can\u2019t wait to see what they do next.\n\nMicrobeMania: I am surprised how well Skatoony holds up. It\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but the quizzing with cartoons is unique. And with Scooby Doo and Guess Who featured, it feels like we\u2019ve got a bit of a detective theme going on. Or is it just me?\n\nRestInToons: September seems pretty far, but I got a feeling that new Teen Titans Go and Johnny Test episodes will make some serious waves. Ben 10, too, has been gearing up for something big, at least that\u2019s the vibe.\n\nHappyMom200: It\u2019s a stable lineup for sure. Steven Universe reruns are still a hit in my house. Plus, I appreciate the educational value in shows like Squish. Keeps the kids learning even out of school\u2014parents\u2019 summer dream!\n\nAdmin5: Great to see such positivity about the lineup!

Coming up next in May 2022, just as summer kicks off, Kids WB is adding Robotboy to the lineup. It\u2019s a nostalgia hit for sure but sad to see some good ones like Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Steven Universe leave us. Thoughts?\n\nTheComicNerd21: Man, Robotboy brings me back. Haven\u2019t seen that little guy in AGES. Sad to see Ben 10 go; it was always a solid watch. But, this is the life of a cartoon fan, right? Out with the old, in with the\u2026 older? \ud83d\ude02\n\nBacteriophage_: Robotboy\u2019s return is quite a surprise. It had that classic boy-and-his-robot vibe. Also, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks? That\u2019s quite the throwback. For those who don\u2019t remember, Chop Socky Chooks was this wild mix of kung fu and chickens\u2014only in cartoons, folks!\n\nCartoonAficionado: Don\u2019t forget about the fall bonanza! Kids WB is loading up with some heavy hitters\u2014Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated. Plus, that new comedy about two blobs? Can\u2019t find much on it, but new content is always exciting!\n\nAmoebaAmy: Wait, so we\u2019re swapping out some superhero action with\u2026 different superhero action, and we\u2019re keeping the mystery with Scooby-Doo. And do I smell a strong comedy theme building up with the two blob cartoon?\n\nRestInToons: Totally digging the superhero update with Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. They bring that comic book essence to the screen. And another comedy about blobs? Guess this one\u2019s the era of the blob, huh?\n\nArtsyOwl: As much as I\u2019ll miss Steven Universe for its depth and progressivism, I guess I\u2019m ready for something light-hearted. Robotboy and the blob comedy might just be the palate cleanser we need. Here\u2019s hoping they deliver some good laughs!\n\nMicrobeMania: Definitely a bummer about Ben 10 and SU. Those shows had such depth in storytelling and character development. But Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated is not to be slept on. That iteration has some of the best arcs for our mystery-solving gang!\n\nScienceRules45: Batman: The Brave and the Bold was a gem! It didn\u2019t take itself too seriously and had just the right amount of camp. And with Ultimate Spider-Man, looks like we\u2019ll still be getting our fix of animated superhero action.\n\nHappyMom200: Love the move to Batman and Spider-Man. My kid has been on a real superhero kick, and Scooby-Doo never gets old. At least, not in my household. The blob comedy sounds intriguing\u2014Kids WB isn\u2019t afraid to experiment, that\u2019s for sure!\n\nAdmin5: With these cartoon cycles, it\u2019s always sad to see some shows go but equally exciting to welcome new titles and welcome back some classics like Robotboy.

It\u2019s always refreshing to see new characters and stories. Also, did anyone catch that Code Lyoko is coming back as a mid-season show? That\u2019s unexpected! I remember watching that show as a kid\u2014the blend of 2D and 3D animation was so cool.\n\nRestInToons: Code Lyoko? No way! That show was my virtual escape. With Craig of the Creek taking a summer break, Code Lyoko has some big shoes to fill. I\u2019m cautiously optimistic. Also, kudos to the person behind \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d. This is indie creators\u2019 dream!\n\nArtsyOwl: Craig of the Creek is my comfort show, so knowing it\u2019s taking a break has me in my feels. But Code Lyoko might just be the perfect summer binge to replace it. That show was ahead of its time with its virtual world storyline.\n\nMicrobeMania: With Chop Socky Chooks, Code Lyoko, and now \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,\u201d I\u2019m sensing a theme of whimsy and adventure. Perfect for a carefree summer! It\u2019s gonna be a wild ride on Kids WB.\n\nScienceRules45: Indeed, summer is shaping up to be full of adventure and laughs! I\u2019m curious to see the comedic dynamics between Gloopy and Glitter and how they\u2019ll fit into the current lineup. Code Lyoko is an excellent addition for anyone who\u2019s into that sci-fi, virtual reality vibe.\n\nHappyMom200: Just peeped the promo for Gloopy and Glitter with the kids. They\u2019re already quoting lines and chuckling. Also, major props to Kids WB for the diversity in its programming\u2014you\u2019ve got old hits, modern takes, and now a homegrown web series making it to the big leagues.\n\nAdmin5: The summer is looking quite adventurous with all the fresh and returning programming we have on our hands! If \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d or Code Lyoko capture your hearts, be sure to come back and let everyone know. Enjoy the shows, everyone, and let\u2019s support those indie creators making waves!\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up where another mid-season show premieres, replacing Gumball, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\nThread Title: Mid-Season Update: The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Replace Gumball on Kids WB! \ud83e\udd29\ud83c\udfaa\n\nTheComicNerd21: Big news for Kids WB watchers! \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d is premiering mid-season, taking the spot \u201cThe Amazing World of Gumball\u201d left behind. I\u2019ve got high hopes that these thrill-seeking siblings will bring the same level of zany to the lineup. Can they live up to the hilarity of Gumball, though? That\u2019s the big question.\n\nGreenJelly223: Gumball\u2019s out?! Say it isn\u2019t so! That show was a staple! But I remember The Adrenalini Brothers from awhile back\u2026they were full of over-the-top stunts and accents. Hopefully, they can fill the quirky cartoon void that\u2019s gonna be left in Gumball\u2019s wake.\n\nCartoonAficionado: \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d are pure comedic gold with those daredevil antics. Gumball set a high bar for humor and heart, but if you want outrageous adventures and laughs, the Adrenalinis could be just the ticket.\n\nArtsyOwl: I admit, I\u2019ll miss the random humor and clever writing of Gumball. It was one of those shows that had something for viewers of all ages. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have a different flavor, but I\u2019m definitely willing to give them a shot.\n\nBacteriophage_: Well folks, all good things must come to an end, but at least the high-paced energy of The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers might fill the void. They\u2019re not new to the cartoon scene, but let\u2019s hope their stunts are as amazing as ever.\n\nMicrobeMania: \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d is a throwback! Those guys pull off some wild stunts. Kids WB seems to be aiming for high octane to take Gumball\u2019s place. Keeping my fingers crossed that they keep delivering fresh content, even in the form of older gems getting the spotlight again.\n\nRestInToons: Guess it\u2019s goodbye to Gumball and hello Adrenalini. I remember the brothers having quite the international flair. Their eclectic style should make for a refreshing change of pace. Plus, with Squish and the others, Kids WB\u2019s variety is still on point.\n\nAmoebaAmy: My kids loved Gumball, so they\u2019re a bit gutted. But I think The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u2019 daredevil acts might just win them over. I\u2019m always down for more shenanigans. Here\u2019s hoping they get as much character-driven hilarity as Gumball had.\n\nScienceRules45: Gumball\u2019s creativity was unmatched, but The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers? That\u2019s a nostalgia trip! Will be interesting to see how a show that\u2019s been off the radar for a while resonates with the current audience.\n\nHappyMom200: My Gumball marathon nights are coming to an end it seems. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have some big shoes to fill, but I\u2019m ready for the laughs. In Kids WB we trust, right? \ud83d\ude02\n\nAdmin5: Change is part of every TV network\u2019s lifecycle. \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d could be what kids WB needs to shake things up. Let\u2019s give these fearless brothers a chance and reconvene here to discuss the stunts, humor, and how the show fits into the new dynamic!\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up in fall when the new shows premiere, Lyoko is sticking around, Gumball and Craig are back, but won\u2019t be for long, leaving again in January, Also, a user says Skatoony will definitely be back next year, as it has been a summer replacement show since 2018\nThread Title: Fall Premieres are Here! Welcome Back Craig & Gumball + Code Lyoko Stays! \ud83c\udf42\ud83d\udcfa\n\nGreenJelly223: It\u2019s fall premiere season, everyone! And with the leaves changing comes new changes to Kids WB. Code Lyoko has secured its spot on the schedule, which I know some of you are thrilled about. The Amazing World of Gumball and Craig of the Creek are making a short-lived comeback, dipping out again in January. Can\u2019t get enough of those two, so I\u2019m here for any time they\u2019re on.\n\nCartoonAficionado: Great to have Gumball and Craig back, even if it\u2019s just for a quick hello and goodbye. It\u2019s like that favorite seasonal dish you can\u2019t stop craving. And Code Lyoko sticking around? Love that for us\u2014those virtual vibes aren\u2019t going anywhere!\n\nTheComicNerd21: Ah, the temporary returns of Gumball and Craig are bittersweet. Makes you wish they\u2019d just stick around full-time. But, I gotta say, Code Lyoko keeping its slot is A-okay with me. That\u2019s one show I\u2019ve been seriously getting back into.\n\nArtsyOwl: The quality storytelling in Craig of the Creek will be sorely missed once January rolls around. And Gumball\u2014it just has that rewatchability factor like no other. Soak it up while you can, folks!\n\nMicrobeMania: Just dropping in to say that Skatoony is going to be back next summer, and I\u2019m here for it! It\u2019s kind of become the unofficial summer tradition since 2018, hasn\u2019t it? Always great to see a show that knows how to fill its seasonal shoes.\n\nBacteriophage_: Yeah, Skatoony\u2019s like that cool summer camp you get excited about all year. But let\u2019s not overlook the fall newcomers too\u2014I\u2019m already setting reminders for Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The superhero binge is real!\n\nRestInToons: Mixed feelings about the short-term return of Gumball and Craig of the Creek. At least we know Kids WB is good at giving us something to look forward to. As for Code Lyoko, it\u2019s been interesting to see a show from yesteryear find its groove with the audience today.\n\nAmoebaAmy: The limited time with Gumball and Craig is better than no time! Let\u2019s enjoy the laughs and adventures while they last. And happy to have confirmed scoops like the one about Skatoony return\u2014it\u2019s this kind of knowledge that keeps the fandom ticking.\n\nScienceRules45: I\u2019ve gotten used to the shift and shuffle of Kids WB\u2019s schedule. You learn to appreciate what you\u2019ve got when you\u2019ve got it. That said, I\u2019m diving headfirst into the nostalgia and newness of this fall\u2019s lineup. It\u2019s going to be an entertaining season!\n\nHappyMom200: I\u2019m grateful for any sprinkles of Craig of the Creek episodes we get! It\u2019s such a gem. And does anyone else get way too competitive watching Skatoony, or is that just me? \ud83d\ude02 Super stoked about its return next year!\n\nAdmin5: Some very astute observations and a tangible excitement for the new and returning shows this fall! Let\u2019s enjoy this season\u2019s offerings, and, as always, keep the conversations engaging as we head into the new year with all its sure-to-be-surprising programming and inevitable farewells.\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up in 2023 where G&G are still rerunning, but Batman, Scooby and Spidey are off, replaced with Ozzy and Drix, World of Quest and Skatoony for summer\nThread Title: 2023 Kids WB Update: Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest & Skatoony Take Over Summer! \ud83c\udf1e\ud83d\udc7e\n\nGreenJelly223: Hey toon enthusiasts! As we hit the sunny stride of 2023, Kids WB is switching up the schedule. We\u2019re saying bye to Batman, Scooby, and Spidey. But don\u2019t despair\u2014Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest, and the ever-reliable Skatoony are here for those summer vibes. Also, \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d are still doing the rerun rounds. Keeping it fresh and funky!\n\nCartoonAficionado: Honestly, it\u2019s cool to see Ozzy & Drix making a comeback. That show was always under the radar but it delivered some solid laughs plus a bit of body-function education. Let\u2019s see how it holds up today!\n\nTheComicNerd21: No more Batman and Spidey is a bummer, but you know what? Bring on the Ozzy & Drix and World of Quest! I remember World of Quest being pretty out there with its humor, a good mix of action and oddball characters\u2014definitely fitting for the wacky tone of summer.\n\nMicrobeMania: Ozzy & Drix, that\u2019s a throwback! I had a feeling it could make a resurgence. Educational and entertaining\u2014that\u2019s a tough balance to strike, but that show had it. Also, cheers to year 5 of summer Skatoony\u2014it\u2019s tradition at this point!\n\nArtsyOwl: Hey, \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d are still in the reruns, too! Shimmering on\u2014quite literally, thanks to Glitter. It\u2019s a quirky and cute show, glad it\u2019s still around for the little ones to enjoy.\n\nBacteriophage_: Seeing World of Quest drop into the lineup makes me hopeful that Kids WB is dedicated to keeping variety alive. Adventure, humor, outright weirdness\u2014it\u2019s got it all. And combined with the educational fun from Ozzy & Drix, plus the game show laughs from Skatoony? Count me in for the summer!\n\nRestInToons: Sayonara superheroes! This season\u2019s lineup shows that kids\u2019 programming isn\u2019t just about capes and villains. It\u2019s about variety, surprise, and a touch of nostalgia. Let\u2019s get microscopic with Ozzy & Drix and go on a wild ride with Quest and Nestor!\n\nAmoebaAmy: Always a tad sad to see the Scooby gang go, but switching up genres keeps things interesting. Ozzy & Drix is kind of like \u201cThe Magic School Bus\u201d for the older crowd, and I\u2019m here for it! Plus, Skatoony is something my kids look forward to every year\u2014glad it\u2019s not going anywhere!\n\nScienceRules45: I\u2019ve got to say, I appreciate how Kids WB keeps mixing in educational content amidst all the comedy and action. Ozzy & Drix is a blast from the past that I\u2019m excited to revisit. It\u2019s just what we need in a world that could use a refresher on health and the human body!\n\nHappyMom200: World of Quest is an underrated treasure, and I\u2019m thrilled it\u2019s coming back into the spotlight. It\u2019s like that fun summer book series but animated. And Skatoony is practically synonymous with summer now; glad to know some things stay solid.\n\nAdmin5: The summer outlook is looking diverse and delightful! With shows that cater to every kind of young fan, there\u2019s no shortage of entertainment. Let\u2019s keep track of these changes and see how they fare in the warm months ahead.

The way they went about this was interesting, In December they started airing promos saying that from January 7 the network would be changing it\u2019s name, it didn\u2019t tell us that 4Kids are now in charge or that there would be new shows, the promo just showed the usual KWB shows like Squish, TAAB, TTG, XS, etc. Also today the promo for the next schedule change (dubbed a Super Duper Late Winter Lineup) has a new slogan \u201cYou\u2019re signed on to the CW4Kids\u201d Slow and painful rebrand? \ud83d\ude12, If you\u2019re not gonna change the bumpers untill Easter then why reveal your flashy new slogan now. Also the website (thecw4kids.com) STILL says this at the footer \u201c\u00a9 2024 Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Global, Nexstar Media Group\u201d Hopefully it is updated to reflect 4Kids\u2019s involvement soon. Write a follow up forum convo where they talk more about the slow transition, and that GoGoRiki is cute, and that it could be primed to take over most of the current comedy cartoons\nThread Title: CW4Kids: A Slow Transition & The Future of Cartoons on the Block? \ud83d\udd04\ud83d\udcfa\n\nToonMasterJay: So, has anyone else noticed how the CW4Kids transition is kinda like watching paint dry? The bumpers feel like Kids WB is haunting us. And they\u2019re dropping their new slogan already, but the website footer is still all about the old guard\u2026 Mixed signals much?\n\nDigitalToonFan: Yeah, the transition is definitely dragging its feet. I mean, if you\u2019re going to bring in 4Kids, then do it with a bang! Not this half-Zoom half-real-life meeting vibe. The new lineup switches could be cool though, but I\u2019ll miss Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers for sure.\n\nGoGoFan223: Honestly, I\u2019m most excited about GoGoRiki (or Smeshariki for the purists). It\u2019s cute and has that potential to be big with the comedy crowd. Less about the action and more laughs\u2014could be the perfect fit for the new direction they\u2019re aiming for.\n\nSonicXforever: Still processing the swap of Squish for Pok\u00e9mon and TAAB for Sonic X\u2026 I mean, sure, classics! But Sonic X has been rerun how many times now? I guess they\u2019re banking on that nostalgia factor to reel us in while they\u2019re redecorating.\n\nPokeNostalgia101: Not going to lie, I\u2019m excited to have Pok\u00e9mon Indigo League back\u2014it\u2019s like comfort food for my soul. But I hear you all, the change is weirdly slow. I get that it\u2019s a big shift from Kids WB to full-on 4Kids ownership, yet you\u2019d think they\u2019d want to make their mark quick.\n\nLyokoLover: Low-key glad Code Lyoko and Xiaolin Showdown are sticking around. They\u2019ve got that unique appeal that isn\u2019t easy to replace. But curious how long till that changes with this new \u201cSuper Duper Late Winter Lineup.\u201d If they\u2019re ushering out TTG and Scooby, who\u2019s next?\n\nAnimanga4Life: Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya coming to the block brings back fond Saturday morning memories! Although, I do get why some are skeptical; a lot of these shows have seen multiple reruns over the years.\n\nWebWader: I keep checking the website hoping it\u2019s been updated\u2026 No dice. The weird blend of old and new branding isn\u2019t helping anyone. At least update the footer to show 4Kids is steering the ship now. How hard can it be?\n\nComicStripKid: The lineup change feels like a balance between targeting the parents who grew up with these shows and trying to appeal to the new gen of cartoon fans. GoGoRiki\u2019s charm and simplicity could be their ticket into the latter\u2019s hearts. I see a mascot in the making.\n\nToonTalker91: Not thrilled about the slow pace here. It\u2019s like we\u2019re stuck in Kids WB limbo. I miss the days when a rebrand meant a fresh start, not this lingering goodbye. Curious how Gloopy and Glitter will fare with the rest of the changes looming\u2026 Will they be the last ones standing?\n\nAdmin_4KidsRevamp: Please bear with us during this transition. We\u2019re working hard to bring a fresh and exciting lineup while honoring the legacy of what came before. Believe us, it\u2019ll be worth the wait!

Nice to see they\u2019re stepping up their game with accounts and points, plus some games to boot!\n\nAnimanga4Life: 4Kids moving in with accounts and points? Sounds like they\u2019re setting up a cool rewards system. And that might just get more kids invested in the website beyond streaming shows\u2014a savvy move.\n\nGoGoFan223: GoGoRiki getting prime time with the big 4Kids dogs is great news. Its cute factor is off the charts. Could be the one to round out the new vibe CW4Kids is going for if they play their cards right.\n\nSonicXforever: Glad to see Sonic racing into the lineup. It\u2019s about time he got back into the limelight. Now to see how he fares among the newer offerings. Talk about a speed battle!\n\nPokeNostalgia101: Pok\u00e9mon getting its rightful place has me all fired up! But it\u2019s kinda odd to still see show pages for the ousted shows on the website. Anyone else notice that? Hopefully, they\u2019ll clear that up soon.\n\nLyokoLover: The fact that Code Lyoko is sticking around amidst all the changes shows its resilience. Maybe 4Kids recognizes the gold they have with some of these Kids WB shows. The perfect yin to their yang.\n\nComicStripKid: Well, can\u2019t say 4Kids isn\u2019t taking a balanced approach to this transition. Keeping half the lineup from Kids WB seems like a strategic way to ensure they don\u2019t lose the existing audience while they woo new viewers with nostalgia and updated features.\n\nWebWader: The website is getting there, slowly but surely. With account functionality and games, it looks like 4Kids is channeling some vintage interactivity magic. Here\u2019s to mission: engage the digitally-savvy generation!\n\nToonTalker91: Seeing \u201c\u00a9 2024 4Kids Entertainment\u201d at the bottom of the website gives me mixed emotions\u2014it\u2019s good to see they\u2019re updating stuff, but the nostalgia for Kids WB is real. Any bets on how long Gloopy and Glitter can hold out?\n\nAdmin_4KidsRevamp: Thanks for sticking with us through the changes!

Plus, line-up\u2019s getting shaken up again\u2014big time!\n\nDigitalToonFan: Heard the scoop that Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, and Ultimate Spider Man are waving goodbye. But we\u2019re keeping the virtual adventures of Code Lyoko and the quirky \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d\u2014two survivors of the cull.\n\nAnimanga4Life: For the manga/anime fans, Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series is swooping in to replace the original Pok\u00e9mon series!

The digital look update has me hyped\u2014it\u2019s like the block is leveling up. Hopefully, it adds a fresh vibe that resonates with the digital generation.\n\nPokeNostalgia101: Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series will def pull in the crowd looking for that cutting-edge anime action. Pok\u00e9mon always knows how to keep things fresh.\n\nLyokoLover: Sad to see some old friends go, but Code Lyoko holding strong gives me hope. It\u2019s like our own little slice of stability in this whirlwind of changes.\n\nComicStripKid: With the digital online style coming, CW4Kids is clearly gunning for a certain look and feel. Let\u2019s just cross our fingers it blends seamlessly with the cartoon essence we all tune in for.\n\nWebWader: Do you think bringing in Chaotic, TMNT, and Viva Pi\u00f1ata is going too far back into the vault? I\u2019m all for nostalgia, but I hope they still invest in newer properties or original content. Balance is key.\n\nToonTalker91: Big stuff with Pok\u00e9mon Horizons; it\u2019s been creating buzz all over! As for Chaotic and TMNT: Back to the Sewer, that\u2019s unexpected! Not so sure what to expect from Viva Pi\u00f1ata, though\u2026 a wildcard entry, I\u2019d say.\n\nAdmin_4KidsRevamp: Expect the unexpected with CW4Kids! We\u2019re committed to delivering a modern digital vibe with the shows you love, new and old.

The rest could be up in the air! Wondering which ones are the chosen few...\n\nToonMasterJay: That's pretty wild to think about! With CW4Kids always shaking things up, guessing the chosen 5 feels like trying to predict the weather. My bets are on at least one of the current fan favs making the cut. \n\nDigitalToonFan: My guess? \"Gloopy and Glitter\" and \"Code Lyoko\" are sticking around. They've consistently shown they can hold their own amidst all the changes. As for the other three slots, Pok\u00e9mon Horizons has got to be a shoo-in, given its global popularity.\n\nAnimanga4Life: With Pok\u00e9mon Horizons on board, CW4Kids is definitely going to want to keep that Pok\u00e9mon hype alive\u2014it's a franchise that never seems to age.

TMNT has reinvented itself more times than I can count\u2014might have an edge there.\n\nGoGoFan223: Wouldn't count out GoGoRiki just yet. It's got that universal appeal and could easily fill a comedy slot among the chosen 5. \n\nPokeNostalgia101: Pok\u00e9mon Horizons seems like a safe bet. It\u2019s one of those franchises that evolves with its audience. As for the rest, it's anybody's game. CW4Kids is pretty unpredictable, but that's part of the excitement, right?\n\nLyokoLover: Protect \"Code Lyoko\" at all costs!

Whichever shows are pulling in the views are likely to stay.

Mid-Season Madness \ud83d\udc1b\ud83d\udcda\n\nGreenJelly223: Hey Squish fans! Did you guys hear the news? There\u2019s a Squish cartoon in the works and it\u2019s hitting Kids WB\u2019s mid-season lineup! Can\u2019t wait to see our favorite amoeba make the jump from page to screen! \ud83d\ude04\n\nMicrobeMania: No way, this is awesome! Squish has been one of my favorite graphic novel series for my kids. They\u2019re going to freak out! Have they announced who\u2019s behind the animation or any voice actors yet?\n\nAmoebaAmy: OMG, this made my day! I stumbled onto the news on Twitter but wasn\u2019t sure if it was real. I just hope they keep the charm of the comics. The sense of humor in Squish is just right for a cartoon!\n\nScienceRules45: @MicrobeMania I read that the team behind some of the recent popular cartoons is on board for this. As for voice actors, nothing\u2019s announced yet. I\u2019m crossing my fingers they get some quality talent. Hoping for some great chemistry between Squish, Pod, and Peggy. \ud83e\udd1e\n\nTheComicNerd21: True, voice acting can make or break a cartoon adaptation. I\u2019m a bit skeptical, tbh. Sometimes these transitions lose the spirit of the original material. But I\u2019ll reserve judgment until we get a trailer or something.\n\nArtsyOwl: Has anyone heard about the art style yet? The simplistic yet expressive style of the books is super charming. Kids WB tends to go for flashier animation, though I hope they keep it close to the spirit of the Squish comics.\n\nHappyMom200: I just hope they tackle the educational aspects well. My kids learned so much about microorganisms from these books while laughing their heads off. It\u2019ll be great for them to watch Squish\u2019s adventures!\n\nBioGeek: Yes! Education through entertainment is the best. I mean, who knew an amoeba could make science this fun? \ud83d\ude05 And considering we\u2019ve all become amateur virologists lately (thanks, 2020), the timing couldn\u2019t be better.\n\nGreenJelly223: For sure, @BioGeek. They have a chance here to really create something that\u2019s as informational as it is entertaining. I also love how the books touch on themes of friendship and acceptance. If they keep that intact, it\u2019s going to be a hit.\n\nMicrobeMania: Anybody have any insider scoop on when we might be getting a peek at the animation or the voice cast? I\u2019m super eager to see anything at this point!\n\nBacteriophage_: Rumors say a teaser might drop sometime in the spring. \ud83c\udf3c Keep your eyes peeled and your streaming devices ready!\n\nAmoebaAmy: Well, here\u2019s hoping Kids WB keeps the slime rolling!

The Squish cartoon is set to premiere in mid-March! Clear your calendars and get ready for some amoeba action! Who\u2019s excited? \ud83c\udf89\n\nCartoonAficionado: Finally, some concrete dates! I\u2019ve been keeping an eye out since our last thread went quiet. Mid-March is sooner than I expected. Also heard about some schedule shake-ups. Looks like Apple and Onion is getting shelved for the Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Not sure how I feel about that one.\n\nAmoebaAmy: Squish is starting soon?! That\u2019s awesome! I\u2019m totally having a viewing party with my kids. But wow, Apple and Onion out for Xiaolin Showdown\u2026nostalgia trip, anyone? I did love that show, but it\u2019s a bit of a genre leap from Apple and Onion. \ud83c\udf00\n\nRestInToons: RIP The Tom and Jerry Show. Kinda saw that ending coming. And to be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May? I need new cartoons, not just rewinds. But Steven Universe is still a gem, at least. \ud83d\udc8e\n\nMicrobeMania: No more Tom and Jerry? That\u2019s the end of an era. Though, to be fair, SU reruns are solid. It\u2019s not every day you get a show that tackles heavy themes with magical aliens. Still, can\u2019t help but hope we get some fresh blood in the lineup eventually.\n\nScienceRules45: True, new content is key, but at least we have Squish! And with TTG, Gumball, and Johnny Test holding the fort as flagships, I think Kids WB has a pretty balanced mix. Squish might just be the breath of fresh air we need right now.\n\nGreenJelly223: So, mid-March for Squish, that\u2019s great! Does anyone know if that\u2019s going to affect TTG, Gumball, or Johnny Test air times? I know they\u2019re the heavy hitters, just hoping Squish gets a good slot that doesn\u2019t clash.\n\nTheComicNerd21: Haven\u2019t seen anything about time changes for the flagships. I reckon Squish will find its place without much issue. Kids WB tends to do well with scheduling around their mainstays. And let\u2019s face it\u2014TTG is practically unmovable at this point.\n\nHappyMom200: My kids will be over the moon with the return of Xiaolin Showdown. I loved it as a kid, too. It\u2019s going to be a mix of new and old at our house with Squish and the reruns. I think Kids WB might just pull off this balance. Still, hoping those reruns are just placeholders for future original content.\n\nArtsyOwl: I\u2019m just happy Squish is making its debut! Sure, schedule changes are always a bit of a rollercoaster, but that\u2019s the nature of TV, right? Out with the old, in with the new\u2026 and sometimes back in with the old! \ud83d\ude02\n\nAdmin5: Friendly reminder to keep industry rumor discussions civil. Looking forward to seeing how Squish is received by the community here! Let\u2019s revisit this thread after the premiere to share our thoughts.

We\u2019re looking at TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, and Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Plus, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Craig of the Creek are all part of the mix. How\u2019s everyone feeling about the current programming?\n\nCartoonAficionado: Honestly, it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag, but I\u2019m not complaining! New fans are getting a taste of some classic toons with Xiaolin Showdown, and Squish has been a pleasant surprise\u2014really nailing it. Plus, Craig of the Creek is always solid. It\u2019s like a buffet of different cartoon flavors this summer.\n\nBacteriophage_: And don\u2019t forget what\u2019s coming in the fall \u2013 new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek, and Johnny Test. September can\u2019t come soon enough!\n\nAmoebaAmy: Squish has been an absolute delight! My kids adore it, and it\u2019s turning into our little summer tradition to watch together. As much as I love TTG and Gumball, it\u2019s Squish that has us tuning in with the most excitement.\n\nTheComicNerd21: A heads-up for all the true toon fans out there: new episodes for some of these shows are usually a blast. I\u2019ve got high hopes for the fall, especially for Craig of the Creek\u2014they\u2019ve been consistently knocking it out of the park.\n\nScienceRules45: I\u2019m just glad we have such variety. Keeps the channel interesting. Summer is always tricky with kids home all day, but this lineup has something for everybody.\n\nArtsyOwl: Agreed on the variety. The blend of classic and contemporary shows has me responding like I\u2019m five and thirteen all at once. \ud83d\ude06 By the way, the art in the latest season of Looney Tunes Cartoons has been stellar. Can\u2019t wait to see what they do next.\n\nMicrobeMania: I am surprised how well Skatoony holds up. It\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but the quizzing with cartoons is unique. And with Scooby Doo and Guess Who featured, it feels like we\u2019ve got a bit of a detective theme going on. Or is it just me?\n\nRestInToons: September seems pretty far, but I got a feeling that new Teen Titans Go and Johnny Test episodes will make some serious waves. Ben 10, too, has been gearing up for something big, at least that\u2019s the vibe.\n\nHappyMom200: It\u2019s a stable lineup for sure. Steven Universe reruns are still a hit in my house. Plus, I appreciate the educational value in shows like Squish. Keeps the kids learning even out of school\u2014parents\u2019 summer dream!\n\nAdmin5: Great to see such positivity about the lineup! As always, discuss your favorite shows, but please remember no spoilers for unaired episodes. Let\u2019s reconvene in this thread when the new episodes drop in September to share our thoughts and reviews!\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up where Robotboy is added to the schedule the next year in May 2022 when Summer begins, B10, LTC and SU are leaving, Robotboy, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks are taking their place, Also in the fall, we have a few new shows, Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the bold and Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated, Also a new acquired comedy cartoon about 2 blobs\nThread Title: Kids WB Schedule Shakeup - Hello Robotboy, So Long Ben 10 & Others! \ud83e\udd16\ud83d\udcfa\n\nGreenJelly223: Hold onto your remotes, toon fans! Coming up next in May 2022, just as summer kicks off, Kids WB is adding Robotboy to the lineup. It\u2019s a nostalgia hit for sure but sad to see some good ones like Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Steven Universe leave us. Thoughts?\n\nTheComicNerd21: Man, Robotboy brings me back. Haven\u2019t seen that little guy in AGES. Sad to see Ben 10 go; it was always a solid watch. But, this is the life of a cartoon fan, right? Out with the old, in with the\u2026 older? \ud83d\ude02\n\nBacteriophage_: Robotboy\u2019s return is quite a surprise. It had that classic boy-and-his-robot vibe. Also, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks? That\u2019s quite the throwback. For those who don\u2019t remember, Chop Socky Chooks was this wild mix of kung fu and chickens\u2014only in cartoons, folks!\n\nCartoonAficionado: Don\u2019t forget about the fall bonanza! Kids WB is loading up with some heavy hitters\u2014Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated. Plus, that new comedy about two blobs? Can\u2019t find much on it, but new content is always exciting!\n\nAmoebaAmy: Wait, so we\u2019re swapping out some superhero action with\u2026 different superhero action, and we\u2019re keeping the mystery with Scooby-Doo. And do I smell a strong comedy theme building up with the two blob cartoon?\n\nRestInToons: Totally digging the superhero update with Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. They bring that comic book essence to the screen. And another comedy about blobs? Guess this one\u2019s the era of the blob, huh?\n\nArtsyOwl: As much as I\u2019ll miss Steven Universe for its depth and progressivism, I guess I\u2019m ready for something light-hearted. Robotboy and the blob comedy might just be the palate cleanser we need. Here\u2019s hoping they deliver some good laughs!\n\nMicrobeMania: Definitely a bummer about Ben 10 and SU. Those shows had such depth in storytelling and character development. But Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated is not to be slept on. That iteration has some of the best arcs for our mystery-solving gang!\n\nScienceRules45: Batman: The Brave and the Bold was a gem! It didn\u2019t take itself too seriously and had just the right amount of camp. And with Ultimate Spider-Man, looks like we\u2019ll still be getting our fix of animated superhero action.\n\nHappyMom200: Love the move to Batman and Spider-Man. My kid has been on a real superhero kick, and Scooby-Doo never gets old. At least, not in my household. The blob comedy sounds intriguing\u2014Kids WB isn\u2019t afraid to experiment, that\u2019s for sure!\n\nAdmin5: With these cartoon cycles, it\u2019s always sad to see some shows go but equally exciting to welcome new titles and welcome back some classics like Robotboy. Remember, fall is just around the corner, so let\u2019s keep the conversation going when those new shows hit the screen.\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up where the blob cartoon is revealed to (be one I made up, hopefully I make it as a YouTube series) be named \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d Gloopy is a normal slime blob wheras Glitter lives up to her name as a sparkling one, Also, a mid season show Code Lyoko is premiering just as COTC knocks off for Summer, Also promos for CSC are already airing\nThread Title: Revealed: \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d Joins Kids WB + Code Lyoko Mid-Season Premiere!\u2728\ud83e\udd16\n\nCartoonAficionado: Alright, the mystery\u2019s solved! The new blob comedy coming to Kids WB is \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d. Gloopy is your average slime blob, and Glitter is, well, super sparkly! Could be a hit if it\u2019s done well. Fingers crossed it\u2019s as fun as the name suggests.\n\nGreenJelly223: \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,\u201d huh? That\u2019s quite the name! I\u2019m all for original content\u2014bringing in some fresh \u2018slime\u2019 to the game. Kudos to the creator, especially if they started on YouTube. That\u2019s one giant leap for slime-kind. \ud83d\ude04\n\nTheComicNerd21: Between Gloopy and Glitter, I\u2019m expecting some madcap hijinks and, hopefully, some good chemistry. Pun totally intended! It\u2019s neat seeing creators move from YouTube to big networks. What a time to be alive!\n\nBacteriophage_: Just saw the promo for Chop Socky Chooks! Honestly, I\u2019d forgotten about that show, but the nostalgia hit me hard. Kids WB really knows how to draw in the old school fans alongside the new ones.\n\nAmoebaAmy: Excited to see what \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d brings to the table! It\u2019s always refreshing to see new characters and stories. Also, did anyone catch that Code Lyoko is coming back as a mid-season show? That\u2019s unexpected! I remember watching that show as a kid\u2014the blend of 2D and 3D animation was so cool.\n\nRestInToons: Code Lyoko? No way! That show was my virtual escape. With Craig of the Creek taking a summer break, Code Lyoko has some big shoes to fill. I\u2019m cautiously optimistic. Also, kudos to the person behind \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d. This is indie creators\u2019 dream!\n\nArtsyOwl: Craig of the Creek is my comfort show, so knowing it\u2019s taking a break has me in my feels. But Code Lyoko might just be the perfect summer binge to replace it. That show was ahead of its time with its virtual world storyline.\n\nMicrobeMania: With Chop Socky Chooks, Code Lyoko, and now \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,\u201d I\u2019m sensing a theme of whimsy and adventure. Perfect for a carefree summer! It\u2019s gonna be a wild ride on Kids WB.\n\nScienceRules45: Indeed, summer is shaping up to be full of adventure and laughs! I\u2019m curious to see the comedic dynamics between Gloopy and Glitter and how they\u2019ll fit into the current lineup. Code Lyoko is an excellent addition for anyone who\u2019s into that sci-fi, virtual reality vibe.\n\nHappyMom200: Just peeped the promo for Gloopy and Glitter with the kids. They\u2019re already quoting lines and chuckling. Also, major props to Kids WB for the diversity in its programming\u2014you\u2019ve got old hits, modern takes, and now a homegrown web series making it to the big leagues.\n\nAdmin5: The summer is looking quite adventurous with all the fresh and returning programming we have on our hands! If \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d or Code Lyoko capture your hearts, be sure to come back and let everyone know. Enjoy the shows, everyone, and let\u2019s support those indie creators making waves!\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up where another mid-season show premieres, replacing Gumball, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\nThread Title: Mid-Season Update: The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Replace Gumball on Kids WB! \ud83e\udd29\ud83c\udfaa\n\nTheComicNerd21: Big news for Kids WB watchers! \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d is premiering mid-season, taking the spot \u201cThe Amazing World of Gumball\u201d left behind. I\u2019ve got high hopes that these thrill-seeking siblings will bring the same level of zany to the lineup. Can they live up to the hilarity of Gumball, though? That\u2019s the big question.\n\nGreenJelly223: Gumball\u2019s out?! Say it isn\u2019t so! That show was a staple! But I remember The Adrenalini Brothers from awhile back\u2026they were full of over-the-top stunts and accents. Hopefully, they can fill the quirky cartoon void that\u2019s gonna be left in Gumball\u2019s wake.\n\nCartoonAficionado: \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d are pure comedic gold with those daredevil antics. Gumball set a high bar for humor and heart, but if you want outrageous adventures and laughs, the Adrenalinis could be just the ticket.\n\nArtsyOwl: I admit, I\u2019ll miss the random humor and clever writing of Gumball. It was one of those shows that had something for viewers of all ages. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have a different flavor, but I\u2019m definitely willing to give them a shot.\n\nBacteriophage_: Well folks, all good things must come to an end, but at least the high-paced energy of The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers might fill the void. They\u2019re not new to the cartoon scene, but let\u2019s hope their stunts are as amazing as ever.\n\nMicrobeMania: \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d is a throwback! Those guys pull off some wild stunts. Kids WB seems to be aiming for high octane to take Gumball\u2019s place. Keeping my fingers crossed that they keep delivering fresh content, even in the form of older gems getting the spotlight again.\n\nRestInToons: Guess it\u2019s goodbye to Gumball and hello Adrenalini. I remember the brothers having quite the international flair. Their eclectic style should make for a refreshing change of pace. Plus, with Squish and the others, Kids WB\u2019s variety is still on point.\n\nAmoebaAmy: My kids loved Gumball, so they\u2019re a bit gutted. But I think The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u2019 daredevil acts might just win them over. I\u2019m always down for more shenanigans. Here\u2019s hoping they get as much character-driven hilarity as Gumball had.\n\nScienceRules45: Gumball\u2019s creativity was unmatched, but The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers? That\u2019s a nostalgia trip! Will be interesting to see how a show that\u2019s been off the radar for a while resonates with the current audience.\n\nHappyMom200: My Gumball marathon nights are coming to an end it seems. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have some big shoes to fill, but I\u2019m ready for the laughs. In Kids WB we trust, right? \ud83d\ude02\n\nAdmin5: Change is part of every TV network\u2019s lifecycle. \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d could be what kids WB needs to shake things up.

Code Lyoko has secured its spot on the schedule, which I know some of you are thrilled about. The Amazing World of Gumball and Craig of the Creek are making a short-lived comeback, dipping out again in January. Can\u2019t get enough of those two, so I\u2019m here for any time they\u2019re on.\n\nCartoonAficionado: Great to have Gumball and Craig back, even if it\u2019s just for a quick hello and goodbye. It\u2019s like that favorite seasonal dish you can\u2019t stop craving. And Code Lyoko sticking around? Love that for us\u2014those virtual vibes aren\u2019t going anywhere!\n\nTheComicNerd21: Ah, the temporary returns of Gumball and Craig are bittersweet. Makes you wish they\u2019d just stick around full-time. But, I gotta say, Code Lyoko keeping its slot is A-okay with me. That\u2019s one show I\u2019ve been seriously getting back into.\n\nArtsyOwl: The quality storytelling in Craig of the Creek will be sorely missed once January rolls around. And Gumball\u2014it just has that rewatchability factor like no other. Soak it up while you can, folks!\n\nMicrobeMania: Just dropping in to say that Skatoony is going to be back next summer, and I\u2019m here for it! It\u2019s kind of become the unofficial summer tradition since 2018, hasn\u2019t it? Always great to see a show that knows how to fill its seasonal shoes.\n\nBacteriophage_: Yeah, Skatoony\u2019s like that cool summer camp you get excited about all year. But let\u2019s not overlook the fall newcomers too\u2014I\u2019m already setting reminders for Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The superhero binge is real!\n\nRestInToons: Mixed feelings about the short-term return of Gumball and Craig of the Creek. At least we know Kids WB is good at giving us something to look forward to. As for Code Lyoko, it\u2019s been interesting to see a show from yesteryear find its groove with the audience today.\n\nAmoebaAmy: The limited time with Gumball and Craig is better than no time! Let\u2019s enjoy the laughs and adventures while they last. And happy to have confirmed scoops like the one about Skatoony return\u2014it\u2019s this kind of knowledge that keeps the fandom ticking.\n\nScienceRules45: I\u2019ve gotten used to the shift and shuffle of Kids WB\u2019s schedule. You learn to appreciate what you\u2019ve got when you\u2019ve got it. That said, I\u2019m diving headfirst into the nostalgia and newness of this fall\u2019s lineup. It\u2019s going to be an entertaining season!\n\nHappyMom200: I\u2019m grateful for any sprinkles of Craig of the Creek episodes we get! It\u2019s such a gem. And does anyone else get way too competitive watching Skatoony, or is that just me? \ud83d\ude02 Super stoked about its return next year!\n\nAdmin5: Some very astute observations and a tangible excitement for the new and returning shows this fall! Let\u2019s enjoy this season\u2019s offerings, and, as always, keep the conversations engaging as we head into the new year with all its sure-to-be-surprising programming and inevitable farewells.\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up in 2023 where G&G are still rerunning, but Batman, Scooby and Spidey are off, replaced with Ozzy and Drix, World of Quest and Skatoony for summer\nThread Title: 2023 Kids WB Update: Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest & Skatoony Take Over Summer! \ud83c\udf1e\ud83d\udc7e\n\nGreenJelly223: Hey toon enthusiasts! As we hit the sunny stride of 2023, Kids WB is switching up the schedule. We\u2019re saying bye to Batman, Scooby, and Spidey. But don\u2019t despair\u2014Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest, and the ever-reliable Skatoony are here for those summer vibes. Also, \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d are still doing the rerun rounds. Keeping it fresh and funky!\n\nCartoonAficionado: Honestly, it\u2019s cool to see Ozzy & Drix making a comeback. That show was always under the radar but it delivered some solid laughs plus a bit of body-function education. Let\u2019s see how it holds up today!\n\nTheComicNerd21: No more Batman and Spidey is a bummer, but you know what? Bring on the Ozzy & Drix and World of Quest! I remember World of Quest being pretty out there with its humor, a good mix of action and oddball characters\u2014definitely fitting for the wacky tone of summer.\n\nMicrobeMania: Ozzy & Drix, that\u2019s a throwback! I had a feeling it could make a resurgence. Educational and entertaining\u2014that\u2019s a tough balance to strike, but that show had it. Also, cheers to year 5 of summer Skatoony\u2014it\u2019s tradition at this point!\n\nArtsyOwl: Hey, \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d are still in the reruns, too! Shimmering on\u2014quite literally, thanks to Glitter. It\u2019s a quirky and cute show, glad it\u2019s still around for the little ones to enjoy.\n\nBacteriophage_: Seeing World of Quest drop into the lineup makes me hopeful that Kids WB is dedicated to keeping variety alive. Adventure, humor, outright weirdness\u2014it\u2019s got it all. And combined with the educational fun from Ozzy & Drix, plus the game show laughs from Skatoony? Count me in for the summer!\n\nRestInToons: Sayonara superheroes! This season\u2019s lineup shows that kids\u2019 programming isn\u2019t just about capes and villains. It\u2019s about variety, surprise, and a touch of nostalgia. Let\u2019s get microscopic with Ozzy & Drix and go on a wild ride with Quest and Nestor!\n\nAmoebaAmy: Always a tad sad to see the Scooby gang go, but switching up genres keeps things interesting. Ozzy & Drix is kind of like \u201cThe Magic School Bus\u201d for the older crowd, and I\u2019m here for it! Plus, Skatoony is something my kids look forward to every year\u2014glad it\u2019s not going anywhere!\n\nScienceRules45: I\u2019ve got to say, I appreciate how Kids WB keeps mixing in educational content amidst all the comedy and action. Ozzy & Drix is a blast from the past that I\u2019m excited to revisit. It\u2019s just what we need in a world that could use a refresher on health and the human body!\n\nHappyMom200: World of Quest is an underrated treasure, and I\u2019m thrilled it\u2019s coming back into the spotlight. It\u2019s like that fun summer book series but animated. And Skatoony is practically synonymous with summer now; glad to know some things stay solid.\n\nAdmin5: The summer outlook is looking diverse and delightful! With shows that cater to every kind of young fan, there\u2019s no shortage of entertainment. Let\u2019s keep track of these changes and see how they fare in the warm months ahead.

The way they went about this was interesting, In December they started airing promos saying that from January 7 the network would be changing it\u2019s name, it didn\u2019t tell us that 4Kids are now in charge or that there would be new shows, the promo just showed the usual KWB shows like Squish, TAAB, TTG, XS, etc. Also today the promo for the next schedule change (dubbed a Super Duper Late Winter Lineup) has a new slogan \u201cYou\u2019re signed on to the CW4Kids\u201d Slow and painful rebrand? \ud83d\ude12, If you\u2019re not gonna change the bumpers untill Easter then why reveal your flashy new slogan now. Also the website (thecw4kids.com) STILL says this at the footer \u201c\u00a9 2024 Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Global, Nexstar Media Group\u201d Hopefully it is updated to reflect 4Kids\u2019s involvement soon. Write a follow up forum convo where they talk more about the slow transition, and that GoGoRiki is cute, and that it could be primed to take over most of the current comedy cartoons\nThread Title: CW4Kids: A Slow Transition & The Future of Cartoons on the Block? \ud83d\udd04\ud83d\udcfa\n\nToonMasterJay: So, has anyone else noticed how the CW4Kids transition is kinda like watching paint dry? The bumpers feel like Kids WB is haunting us. And they\u2019re dropping their new slogan already, but the website footer is still all about the old guard\u2026 Mixed signals much?\n\nDigitalToonFan: Yeah, the transition is definitely dragging its feet. I mean, if you\u2019re going to bring in 4Kids, then do it with a bang! Not this half-Zoom half-real-life meeting vibe. The new lineup switches could be cool though, but I\u2019ll miss Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers for sure.\n\nGoGoFan223: Honestly, I\u2019m most excited about GoGoRiki (or Smeshariki for the purists). It\u2019s cute and has that potential to be big with the comedy crowd. Less about the action and more laughs\u2014could be the perfect fit for the new direction they\u2019re aiming for.\n\nSonicXforever: Still processing the swap of Squish for Pok\u00e9mon and TAAB for Sonic X\u2026 I mean, sure, classics! But Sonic X has been rerun how many times now? I guess they\u2019re banking on that nostalgia factor to reel us in while they\u2019re redecorating.\n\nPokeNostalgia101: Not going to lie, I\u2019m excited to have Pok\u00e9mon Indigo League back\u2014it\u2019s like comfort food for my soul. But I hear you all, the change is weirdly slow. I get that it\u2019s a big shift from Kids WB to full-on 4Kids ownership, yet you\u2019d think they\u2019d want to make their mark quick.\n\nLyokoLover: Low-key glad Code Lyoko and Xiaolin Showdown are sticking around. They\u2019ve got that unique appeal that isn\u2019t easy to replace. But curious how long till that changes with this new \u201cSuper Duper Late Winter Lineup.\u201d If they\u2019re ushering out TTG and Scooby, who\u2019s next?\n\nAnimanga4Life: Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya coming to the block brings back fond Saturday morning memories! Although, I do get why some are skeptical; a lot of these shows have seen multiple reruns over the years.\n\nWebWader: I keep checking the website hoping it\u2019s been updated\u2026 No dice. The weird blend of old and new branding isn\u2019t helping anyone. At least update the footer to show 4Kids is steering the ship now. How hard can it be?\n\nComicStripKid: The lineup change feels like a balance between targeting the parents who grew up with these shows and trying to appeal to the new gen of cartoon fans. GoGoRiki\u2019s charm and simplicity could be their ticket into the latter\u2019s hearts. I see a mascot in the making.\n\nToonTalker91: Not thrilled about the slow pace here. It\u2019s like we\u2019re stuck in Kids WB limbo. I miss the days when a rebrand meant a fresh start, not this lingering goodbye. Curious how Gloopy and Glitter will fare with the rest of the changes looming\u2026 Will they be the last ones standing?\n\nAdmin_4KidsRevamp: Please bear with us during this transition. We\u2019re working hard to bring a fresh and exciting lineup while honoring the legacy of what came before. Believe us, it\u2019ll be worth the wait! Stay tuned for more updates and enjoy the shows in the meantime.\n\nThread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp\nWrite a follow up in mid Feb where the Feb lineup is here, 5 4Kids shows (Pokemon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby and GoGoRiki) and 5 Kids WB shows (Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter and Code Lyoko) Also, the website now has an account and points system, games, and has updated the footer to \u201c\u00a9 2024 4Kids Entertainment\u201d, Website otherwise remains the same, and still has show pages for removed shows, but this will slowly change in the coming weeks\nThread Title: CW4Kids Mid-Feb Lineup is Live!

It\u2019s a mix of eras in one block!\n\nToonMasterJay: Checked out the CW4Kids website, they finally ditched the old footer. It\u2019s official, this ship is sailing under the 4Kids flag now. Nice to see they\u2019re stepping up their game with accounts and points, plus some games to boot!\n\nAnimanga4Life: 4Kids moving in with accounts and points? Sounds like they\u2019re setting up a cool rewards system. And that might just get more kids invested in the website beyond streaming shows\u2014a savvy move.\n\nGoGoFan223: GoGoRiki getting prime time with the big 4Kids dogs is great news. Its cute factor is off the charts. Could be the one to round out the new vibe CW4Kids is going for if they play their cards right.\n\nSonicXforever: Glad to see Sonic racing into the lineup. It\u2019s about time he got back into the limelight. Now to see how he fares among the newer offerings. Talk about a speed battle!\n\nPokeNostalgia101: Pok\u00e9mon getting its rightful place has me all fired up! But it\u2019s kinda odd to still see show pages for the ousted shows on the website. Anyone else notice that? Hopefully, they\u2019ll clear that up soon.\n\nLyokoLover: The fact that Code Lyoko is sticking around amidst all the changes shows its resilience. Maybe 4Kids recognizes the gold they have with some of these Kids WB shows. The perfect yin to their yang.\n\nComicStripKid: Well, can\u2019t say 4Kids isn\u2019t taking a balanced approach to this transition. Keeping half the lineup from Kids WB seems like a strategic way to ensure they don\u2019t lose the existing audience while they woo new viewers with nostalgia and updated features.\n\nWebWader: The website is getting there, slowly but surely. With account functionality and games, it looks like 4Kids is channeling some vintage interactivity magic. Here\u2019s to mission: engage the digitally-savvy generation!\n\nToonTalker91: Seeing \u201c\u00a9 2024 4Kids Entertainment\u201d at the bottom of the website gives me mixed emotions\u2014it\u2019s good to see they\u2019re updating stuff, but the nostalgia for Kids WB is real. Any bets on how long Gloopy and Glitter can hold out?\n\nAdmin_4KidsRevamp: Thanks for sticking with us through the changes!

Plus, line-up\u2019s getting shaken up again\u2014big time!\n\nDigitalToonFan: Heard the scoop that Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, and Ultimate Spider Man are waving goodbye. But we\u2019re keeping the virtual adventures of Code Lyoko and the quirky \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d\u2014two survivors of the cull.\n\nAnimanga4Life: For the manga/anime fans, Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series is swooping in to replace the original Pok\u00e9mon series! Exciting to see some new journeys and battles. Gotta love the continuous evolution of the Pok\u00e9mon franchise on the CW4Kids.\n\nGoGoFan223: And what about that triple threat joining the fray? Chaotic, TMNT: Back to the Sewer, and Viva Pi\u00f1ata are about to spice things up!

The digital look update has me hyped\u2014it\u2019s like the block is leveling up. Hopefully, it adds a fresh vibe that resonates with the digital generation.\n\nPokeNostalgia101: Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series will def pull in the crowd looking for that cutting-edge anime action. Pok\u00e9mon always knows how to keep things fresh.\n\nLyokoLover: Sad to see some old friends go, but Code Lyoko holding strong gives me hope. It\u2019s like our own little slice of stability in this whirlwind of changes.\n\nComicStripKid: With the digital online style coming, CW4Kids is clearly gunning for a certain look and feel. Let\u2019s just cross our fingers it blends seamlessly with the cartoon essence we all tune in for.\n\nWebWader: Do you think bringing in Chaotic, TMNT, and Viva Pi\u00f1ata is going too far back into the vault? I\u2019m all for nostalgia, but I hope they still invest in newer properties or original content. Balance is key.\n\nToonTalker91: Big stuff with Pok\u00e9mon Horizons; it\u2019s been creating buzz all over! As for Chaotic and TMNT: Back to the Sewer, that\u2019s unexpected! Not so sure what to expect from Viva Pi\u00f1ata, though\u2026 a wildcard entry, I\u2019d say.\n\nAdmin_4KidsRevamp: Expect the unexpected with CW4Kids! We\u2019re committed to delivering a modern digital vibe with the shows you love, new and old.

Ready your sea legs and spirit for some grand adventures and...unique 4Kids dubbing.\n\nDigitalToonFan: One Piece entering the CW4Kids waters is huge\u2014literally and figuratively! There's so much potential for Luffy and his crew. As for JoJo's Weird Quest, I'm intrigued to see how 4Kids handles the, well, bizarre elements of JBA.\n\nAnimanga4Life: 4Kids adding One Piece?! That\u2019s a voyage I didn\u2019t see coming. Plus, JoJo's Weird Quest? That title alone has me curious. Crossing my fingers they preserve the essence of what makes these series stand out, even with their localization quirks.\n\nGoGoFan223: Gotta admit, \"JoJo\u2019s Weird Quest\" has a certain ring to it. It\u2019s definitely going to be interesting to see how they adapt such a uniquely styled series. And One Piece is a legendary addition that might just breathe new life into the weekend lineup.\n\nSonicXforever: Dubbing JoJo and One Piece is no small feat. One Piece with its endless adventure and JoJo with its signature style... 4Kids has its work cut out. Can't wait to see how these series are received.\n\nPokeNostalgia101: Adding iconic series like One Piece and what I guess we're calling JoJo's Weird Quest is a bold move. It\u2019ll attract not just the kids but also the older anime fans curious to see 4Kids\u2019 take on these classics.\n\nLyokoLover: While I'm here for Code Lyoko\u2019s digital dives, the addition of grand adventure and, well, weird quests sounds like a blast. This might just pull in more viewers who appreciate a good story with their animation.\n\nComicStripKid: One Piece and JoJo entering the fray shows 4Kids is serious about diversifying their content. I'm all for bringing more anime to the forefront. Just hoping they handle the localizations carefully\u2014both series have passionate fanbases.\n\nWebWader: This news is huge! One Piece and JoJo's Weird Quest joining CW4Kids is sure to shake things up. I'm curious about the dubbing choices and how they'll fit into the broader programming block. It's a fresh direction that might pay off big.\n\nToonTalker91: Talk about raising the anchor and setting off! One Piece promises epic journeys, and I\u2019m eager for JoJo's Weird Quest, albeit skeptical about the naming... But who knows?

TMNT and Viva Pi\u00f1ata, maybe? They're cool and all, but do they stand a chance against the anime giants? \n\nAnimanga4Life: Honestly, I\u2019d be surprised to see TMNT go. It\u2019s got that legacy factor. As for Viva Pi\u00f1ata, well, it\u2019s cute but maybe not a crowd-puller like One Piece or JoJo could be. Hard choices for the CW4Kids schedulers, for sure.\n\nGoGoFan223: I\u2019m in the guessing game too. TMNT feels like it still has some kick left, but when you\u2019re bringing in heavy hitters from the anime world, something\u2019s gotta give. Viva Pi\u00f1ata is my bet for one of the slots opening up. \n\nSonicXforever: Dropping TMNT would be a blow, but let\u2019s not forget the business side of things. One Piece and JoJo have the potential to pull in a wider and more diverse audience. And yeah, Viva Pi\u00f1ata, while unique, hasn\u2019t captured the buzz they probably hoped for.\n\nPokeNostalgia101: It\u2019s tough seeing any show leave, especially when you\u2019ve got favorites. But CW4Kids aiming for that mix of nostalgia and fresh anime is a smart move. TMNT and Viva Pi\u00f1ata parting ways seem like a fair trade for what\u2019s coming.\n\nLyokoLover: In the midst of all these changes, I'm just glad Code Lyoko and G&G are holding strong. Shows the block values a variety. Still, sad to see any shows go. TMNT and Viva Pi\u00f1ata had their charm.\n\nComicStripKid: The writing seems to be on the wall for TMNT and Viva Pi\u00f1ata. With anime's rising popularity, especially titles with the draw of One Piece and JoJo, it\u2019s clear CW4Kids is adjusting sails to catch that wind.\n\nWebWader: It\u2019s bittersweet, change always is. TMNT has been a cornerstone for so long, but One Piece and JoJo might just redefine weekend cartoons. Viva Pi\u00f1ata\u2019s a different vibe, but perhaps not the vibe CW4Kids is going for now.\n\nToonTalker91: Never easy to guess these lineup changes, but One Piece and JoJo are guaranteed to shake things up. If TMNT and Viva Pi\u00f1ata are indeed heading out, they've had a good run. Here's to new adventures and weird quests!\n\nAdmin_4KidsRevamp: We appreciate all the speculation and discussion!

Mid-Season Madness \ud83d\udc1b\ud83d\udcda\n\nGreenJelly223: Hey Squish fans! Did you guys hear the news? There\u2019s a Squish cartoon in the works and it\u2019s hitting Kids WB\u2019s mid-season lineup! Can\u2019t wait to see our favorite amoeba make the jump from page to screen! \ud83d\ude04\n\nMicrobeMania: No way, this is awesome! Squish has been one of my favorite graphic novel series for my kids. They\u2019re going to freak out! Have they announced who\u2019s behind the animation or any voice actors yet?\n\nAmoebaAmy: OMG, this made my day! I stumbled onto the news on Twitter but wasn\u2019t sure if it was real. I just hope they keep the charm of the comics. The sense of humor in Squish is just right for a cartoon!\n\nScienceRules45: @MicrobeMania I read that the team behind some of the recent popular cartoons is on board for this. As for voice actors, nothing\u2019s announced yet. I\u2019m crossing my fingers they get some quality talent. Hoping for some great chemistry between Squish, Pod, and Peggy. \ud83e\udd1e\n\nTheComicNerd21: True, voice acting can make or break a cartoon adaptation. I\u2019m a bit skeptical, tbh. Sometimes these transitions lose the spirit of the original material. But I\u2019ll reserve judgment until we get a trailer or something.\n\nArtsyOwl: Has anyone heard about the art style yet? The simplistic yet expressive style of the books is super charming. Kids WB tends to go for flashier animation, though I hope they keep it close to the spirit of the Squish comics.\n\nHappyMom200: I just hope they tackle the educational aspects well. My kids learned so much about microorganisms from these books while laughing their heads off. It\u2019ll be great for them to watch Squish\u2019s adventures!\n\nBioGeek: Yes! Education through entertainment is the best. I mean, who knew an amoeba could make science this fun? \ud83d\ude05 And considering we\u2019ve all become amateur virologists lately (thanks, 2020), the timing couldn\u2019t be better.\n\nGreenJelly223: For sure, @BioGeek. They have a chance here to really create something that\u2019s as informational as it is entertaining. I also love how the books touch on themes of friendship and acceptance. If they keep that intact, it\u2019s going to be a hit.\n\nMicrobeMania: Anybody have any insider scoop on when we might be getting a peek at the animation or the voice cast? I\u2019m super eager to see anything at this point!\n\nBacteriophage_: Rumors say a teaser might drop sometime in the spring. \ud83c\udf3c Keep your eyes peeled and your streaming devices ready!\n\nAmoebaAmy: Well, here\u2019s hoping Kids WB keeps the slime rolling!

The Squish cartoon is set to premiere in mid-March! Clear your calendars and get ready for some amoeba action! Who\u2019s excited? \ud83c\udf89\n\nCartoonAficionado: Finally, some concrete dates! I\u2019ve been keeping an eye out since our last thread went quiet. Mid-March is sooner than I expected. Also heard about some schedule shake-ups. Looks like Apple and Onion is getting shelved for the Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Not sure how I feel about that one.\n\nAmoebaAmy: Squish is starting soon?! That\u2019s awesome! I\u2019m totally having a viewing party with my kids. But wow, Apple and Onion out for Xiaolin Showdown\u2026nostalgia trip, anyone? I did love that show, but it\u2019s a bit of a genre leap from Apple and Onion. \ud83c\udf00\n\nRestInToons: RIP The Tom and Jerry Show. Kinda saw that ending coming. And to be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May? I need new cartoons, not just rewinds. But Steven Universe is still a gem, at least. \ud83d\udc8e\n\nMicrobeMania: No more Tom and Jerry? That\u2019s the end of an era. Though, to be fair, SU reruns are solid. It\u2019s not every day you get a show that tackles heavy themes with magical aliens. Still, can\u2019t help but hope we get some fresh blood in the lineup eventually.\n\nScienceRules45: True, new content is key, but at least we have Squish! And with TTG, Gumball, and Johnny Test holding the fort as flagships, I think Kids WB has a pretty balanced mix. Squish might just be the breath of fresh air we need right now.\n\nGreenJelly223: So, mid-March for Squish, that\u2019s great! Does anyone know if that\u2019s going to affect TTG, Gumball, or Johnny Test air times? I know they\u2019re the heavy hitters, just hoping Squish gets a good slot that doesn\u2019t clash.\n\nTheComicNerd21: Haven\u2019t seen anything about time changes for the flagships. I reckon Squish will find its place without much issue. Kids WB tends to do well with scheduling around their mainstays. And let\u2019s face it\u2014TTG is practically unmovable at this point.\n\nHappyMom200: My kids will be over the moon with the return of Xiaolin Showdown. I loved it as a kid, too. It\u2019s going to be a mix of new and old at our house with Squish and the reruns. I think Kids WB might just pull off this balance. Still, hoping those reruns are just placeholders for future original content.\n\nArtsyOwl: I\u2019m just happy Squish is making its debut! Sure, schedule changes are always a bit of a rollercoaster, but that\u2019s the nature of TV, right? Out with the old, in with the new\u2026 and sometimes back in with the old! \ud83d\ude02\n\nAdmin5: Friendly reminder to keep industry rumor discussions civil. Looking forward to seeing how Squish is received by the community here! Let\u2019s revisit this thread after the premiere to share our thoughts.

We\u2019re looking at TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, and Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Plus, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Craig of the Creek are all part of the mix. How\u2019s everyone feeling about the current programming?\n\nCartoonAficionado: Honestly, it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag, but I\u2019m not complaining! New fans are getting a taste of some classic toons with Xiaolin Showdown, and Squish has been a pleasant surprise\u2014really nailing it. Plus, Craig of the Creek is always solid. It\u2019s like a buffet of different cartoon flavors this summer.\n\nBacteriophage_: And don\u2019t forget what\u2019s coming in the fall \u2013 new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek, and Johnny Test. September can\u2019t come soon enough!\n\nAmoebaAmy: Squish has been an absolute delight! My kids adore it, and it\u2019s turning into our little summer tradition to watch together. As much as I love TTG and Gumball, it\u2019s Squish that has us tuning in with the most excitement.\n\nTheComicNerd21: A heads-up for all the true toon fans out there: new episodes for some of these shows are usually a blast. I\u2019ve got high hopes for the fall, especially for Craig of the Creek\u2014they\u2019ve been consistently knocking it out of the park.\n\nScienceRules45: I\u2019m just glad we have such variety. Keeps the channel interesting. Summer is always tricky with kids home all day, but this lineup has something for everybody.\n\nArtsyOwl: Agreed on the variety. The blend of classic and contemporary shows has me responding like I\u2019m five and thirteen all at once. \ud83d\ude06 By the way, the art in the latest season of Looney Tunes Cartoons has been stellar. Can\u2019t wait to see what they do next.\n\nMicrobeMania: I am surprised how well Skatoony holds up. It\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but the quizzing with cartoons is unique. And with Scooby Doo and Guess Who featured, it feels like we\u2019ve got a bit of a detective theme going on. Or is it just me?\n\nRestInToons: September seems pretty far, but I got a feeling that new Teen Titans Go and Johnny Test episodes will make some serious waves. Ben 10, too, has been gearing up for something big, at least that\u2019s the vibe.\n\nHappyMom200: It\u2019s a stable lineup for sure. Steven Universe reruns are still a hit in my house. Plus, I appreciate the educational value in shows like Squish. Keeps the kids learning even out of school\u2014parents\u2019 summer dream!\n\nAdmin5: Great to see such positivity about the lineup! As always, discuss your favorite shows, but please remember no spoilers for unaired episodes.

Coming up next in May 2022, just as summer kicks off, Kids WB is adding Robotboy to the lineup. It\u2019s a nostalgia hit for sure but sad to see some good ones like Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Steven Universe leave us. Thoughts?\n\nTheComicNerd21: Man, Robotboy brings me back. Haven\u2019t seen that little guy in AGES. Sad to see Ben 10 go; it was always a solid watch. But, this is the life of a cartoon fan, right? Out with the old, in with the\u2026 older? \ud83d\ude02\n\nBacteriophage_: Robotboy\u2019s return is quite a surprise. It had that classic boy-and-his-robot vibe. Also, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks? That\u2019s quite the throwback. For those who don\u2019t remember, Chop Socky Chooks was this wild mix of kung fu and chickens\u2014only in cartoons, folks!\n\nCartoonAficionado: Don\u2019t forget about the fall bonanza! Kids WB is loading up with some heavy hitters\u2014Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated. Plus, that new comedy about two blobs? Can\u2019t find much on it, but new content is always exciting!\n\nAmoebaAmy: Wait, so we\u2019re swapping out some superhero action with\u2026 different superhero action, and we\u2019re keeping the mystery with Scooby-Doo. And do I smell a strong comedy theme building up with the two blob cartoon?\n\nRestInToons: Totally digging the superhero update with Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. They bring that comic book essence to the screen. And another comedy about blobs? Guess this one\u2019s the era of the blob, huh?\n\nArtsyOwl: As much as I\u2019ll miss Steven Universe for its depth and progressivism, I guess I\u2019m ready for something light-hearted. Robotboy and the blob comedy might just be the palate cleanser we need. Here\u2019s hoping they deliver some good laughs!\n\nMicrobeMania: Definitely a bummer about Ben 10 and SU. Those shows had such depth in storytelling and character development. But Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated is not to be slept on. That iteration has some of the best arcs for our mystery-solving gang!\n\nScienceRules45: Batman: The Brave and the Bold was a gem! It didn\u2019t take itself too seriously and had just the right amount of camp. And with Ultimate Spider-Man, looks like we\u2019ll still be getting our fix of animated superhero action.\n\nHappyMom200: Love the move to Batman and Spider-Man. My kid has been on a real superhero kick, and Scooby-Doo never gets old. At least, not in my household. The blob comedy sounds intriguing\u2014Kids WB isn\u2019t afraid to experiment, that\u2019s for sure!\n\nAdmin5: With these cartoon cycles, it\u2019s always sad to see some shows go but equally exciting to welcome new titles and welcome back some classics like Robotboy. Remember, fall is just around the corner, so let\u2019s keep the conversation going when those new shows hit the screen.\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up where the blob cartoon is revealed to (be one I made up, hopefully I make it as a YouTube series) be named \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d Gloopy is a normal slime blob wheras Glitter lives up to her name as a sparkling one, Also, a mid season show Code Lyoko is premiering just as COTC knocks off for Summer, Also promos for CSC are already airing\nThread Title: Revealed: \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d Joins Kids WB + Code Lyoko Mid-Season Premiere!\u2728\ud83e\udd16\n\nCartoonAficionado: Alright, the mystery\u2019s solved! The new blob comedy coming to Kids WB is \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d. Gloopy is your average slime blob, and Glitter is, well, super sparkly! Could be a hit if it\u2019s done well. Fingers crossed it\u2019s as fun as the name suggests.\n\nGreenJelly223: \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,\u201d huh? That\u2019s quite the name! I\u2019m all for original content\u2014bringing in some fresh \u2018slime\u2019 to the game. Kudos to the creator, especially if they started on YouTube. That\u2019s one giant leap for slime-kind. \ud83d\ude04\n\nTheComicNerd21: Between Gloopy and Glitter, I\u2019m expecting some madcap hijinks and, hopefully, some good chemistry. Pun totally intended! It\u2019s neat seeing creators move from YouTube to big networks. What a time to be alive!\n\nBacteriophage_: Just saw the promo for Chop Socky Chooks! Honestly, I\u2019d forgotten about that show, but the nostalgia hit me hard. Kids WB really knows how to draw in the old school fans alongside the new ones.\n\nAmoebaAmy: Excited to see what \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d brings to the table! It\u2019s always refreshing to see new characters and stories. Also, did anyone catch that Code Lyoko is coming back as a mid-season show? That\u2019s unexpected! I remember watching that show as a kid\u2014the blend of 2D and 3D animation was so cool.\n\nRestInToons: Code Lyoko? No way! That show was my virtual escape. With Craig of the Creek taking a summer break, Code Lyoko has some big shoes to fill. I\u2019m cautiously optimistic. Also, kudos to the person behind \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d. This is indie creators\u2019 dream!\n\nArtsyOwl: Craig of the Creek is my comfort show, so knowing it\u2019s taking a break has me in my feels. But Code Lyoko might just be the perfect summer binge to replace it. That show was ahead of its time with its virtual world storyline.\n\nMicrobeMania: With Chop Socky Chooks, Code Lyoko, and now \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,\u201d I\u2019m sensing a theme of whimsy and adventure. Perfect for a carefree summer! It\u2019s gonna be a wild ride on Kids WB.\n\nScienceRules45: Indeed, summer is shaping up to be full of adventure and laughs! I\u2019m curious to see the comedic dynamics between Gloopy and Glitter and how they\u2019ll fit into the current lineup. Code Lyoko is an excellent addition for anyone who\u2019s into that sci-fi, virtual reality vibe.\n\nHappyMom200: Just peeped the promo for Gloopy and Glitter with the kids. They\u2019re already quoting lines and chuckling. Also, major props to Kids WB for the diversity in its programming\u2014you\u2019ve got old hits, modern takes, and now a homegrown web series making it to the big leagues.\n\nAdmin5: The summer is looking quite adventurous with all the fresh and returning programming we have on our hands! If \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d or Code Lyoko capture your hearts, be sure to come back and let everyone know. Enjoy the shows, everyone, and let\u2019s support those indie creators making waves!\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up where another mid-season show premieres, replacing Gumball, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\nThread Title: Mid-Season Update: The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Replace Gumball on Kids WB! \ud83e\udd29\ud83c\udfaa\n\nTheComicNerd21: Big news for Kids WB watchers! \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d is premiering mid-season, taking the spot \u201cThe Amazing World of Gumball\u201d left behind. I\u2019ve got high hopes that these thrill-seeking siblings will bring the same level of zany to the lineup. Can they live up to the hilarity of Gumball, though? That\u2019s the big question.\n\nGreenJelly223: Gumball\u2019s out?! Say it isn\u2019t so! That show was a staple! But I remember The Adrenalini Brothers from awhile back\u2026they were full of over-the-top stunts and accents. Hopefully, they can fill the quirky cartoon void that\u2019s gonna be left in Gumball\u2019s wake.\n\nCartoonAficionado: \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d are pure comedic gold with those daredevil antics. Gumball set a high bar for humor and heart, but if you want outrageous adventures and laughs, the Adrenalinis could be just the ticket.\n\nArtsyOwl: I admit, I\u2019ll miss the random humor and clever writing of Gumball. It was one of those shows that had something for viewers of all ages. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have a different flavor, but I\u2019m definitely willing to give them a shot.\n\nBacteriophage_: Well folks, all good things must come to an end, but at least the high-paced energy of The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers might fill the void. They\u2019re not new to the cartoon scene, but let\u2019s hope their stunts are as amazing as ever.\n\nMicrobeMania: \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d is a throwback! Those guys pull off some wild stunts. Kids WB seems to be aiming for high octane to take Gumball\u2019s place. Keeping my fingers crossed that they keep delivering fresh content, even in the form of older gems getting the spotlight again.\n\nRestInToons: Guess it\u2019s goodbye to Gumball and hello Adrenalini. I remember the brothers having quite the international flair. Their eclectic style should make for a refreshing change of pace. Plus, with Squish and the others, Kids WB\u2019s variety is still on point.\n\nAmoebaAmy: My kids loved Gumball, so they\u2019re a bit gutted. But I think The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u2019 daredevil acts might just win them over. I\u2019m always down for more shenanigans. Here\u2019s hoping they get as much character-driven hilarity as Gumball had.\n\nScienceRules45: Gumball\u2019s creativity was unmatched, but The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers? That\u2019s a nostalgia trip! Will be interesting to see how a show that\u2019s been off the radar for a while resonates with the current audience.\n\nHappyMom200: My Gumball marathon nights are coming to an end it seems. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have some big shoes to fill, but I\u2019m ready for the laughs. In Kids WB we trust, right? \ud83d\ude02\n\nAdmin5: Change is part of every TV network\u2019s lifecycle. \u201cThe Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\u201d could be what kids WB needs to shake things up.

Code Lyoko has secured its spot on the schedule, which I know some of you are thrilled about. The Amazing World of Gumball and Craig of the Creek are making a short-lived comeback, dipping out again in January. Can\u2019t get enough of those two, so I\u2019m here for any time they\u2019re on.\n\nCartoonAficionado: Great to have Gumball and Craig back, even if it\u2019s just for a quick hello and goodbye. It\u2019s like that favorite seasonal dish you can\u2019t stop craving. And Code Lyoko sticking around? Love that for us\u2014those virtual vibes aren\u2019t going anywhere!\n\nTheComicNerd21: Ah, the temporary returns of Gumball and Craig are bittersweet. Makes you wish they\u2019d just stick around full-time. But, I gotta say, Code Lyoko keeping its slot is A-okay with me. That\u2019s one show I\u2019ve been seriously getting back into.\n\nArtsyOwl: The quality storytelling in Craig of the Creek will be sorely missed once January rolls around. And Gumball\u2014it just has that rewatchability factor like no other. Soak it up while you can, folks!\n\nMicrobeMania: Just dropping in to say that Skatoony is going to be back next summer, and I\u2019m here for it! It\u2019s kind of become the unofficial summer tradition since 2018, hasn\u2019t it? Always great to see a show that knows how to fill its seasonal shoes.\n\nBacteriophage_: Yeah, Skatoony\u2019s like that cool summer camp you get excited about all year. But let\u2019s not overlook the fall newcomers too\u2014I\u2019m already setting reminders for Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The superhero binge is real!\n\nRestInToons: Mixed feelings about the short-term return of Gumball and Craig of the Creek. At least we know Kids WB is good at giving us something to look forward to. As for Code Lyoko, it\u2019s been interesting to see a show from yesteryear find its groove with the audience today.\n\nAmoebaAmy: The limited time with Gumball and Craig is better than no time! Let\u2019s enjoy the laughs and adventures while they last. And happy to have confirmed scoops like the one about Skatoony return\u2014it\u2019s this kind of knowledge that keeps the fandom ticking.\n\nScienceRules45: I\u2019ve gotten used to the shift and shuffle of Kids WB\u2019s schedule. You learn to appreciate what you\u2019ve got when you\u2019ve got it. That said, I\u2019m diving headfirst into the nostalgia and newness of this fall\u2019s lineup. It\u2019s going to be an entertaining season!\n\nHappyMom200: I\u2019m grateful for any sprinkles of Craig of the Creek episodes we get! It\u2019s such a gem. And does anyone else get way too competitive watching Skatoony, or is that just me? \ud83d\ude02 Super stoked about its return next year!\n\nAdmin5: Some very astute observations and a tangible excitement for the new and returning shows this fall! Let\u2019s enjoy this season\u2019s offerings, and, as always, keep the conversations engaging as we head into the new year with all its sure-to-be-surprising programming and inevitable farewells.\n\nThread Closed by Admin5\nWrite a follow up in 2023 where G&G are still rerunning, but Batman, Scooby and Spidey are off, replaced with Ozzy and Drix, World of Quest and Skatoony for summer\nThread Title: 2023 Kids WB Update: Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest & Skatoony Take Over Summer! \ud83c\udf1e\ud83d\udc7e\n\nGreenJelly223: Hey toon enthusiasts! As we hit the sunny stride of 2023, Kids WB is switching up the schedule. We\u2019re saying bye to Batman, Scooby, and Spidey. But don\u2019t despair\u2014Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest, and the ever-reliable Skatoony are here for those summer vibes. Also, \u201cThe Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\u201d are still doing the rerun rounds. Keeping it fresh and funky!\n\nCartoonAficionado: Honestly, it\u2019s cool to see Ozzy & Drix making a comeback. That show was always under the radar but it delivered some solid laughs plus a bit of body-function education. Let\u2019s see how it holds up today!\n\nTheComicNerd21: No more Batman and Spidey is a bummer, but you know what? Bring on the Ozzy & Drix and World of Quest! I remember World of Quest being pretty out there with its humor, a good mix of action and oddball characters\u2014definitely fitting for the wacky tone of summer.\n\nMicrobeMania: Ozzy & Drix, that\u2019s a throwback! I had a feeling it could make a resurgence. Educational and entertaining\u2014that\u2019s a tough balance to strike, but that show had it. Also, cheers to year 5 of summer Skatoony\u2014it\u2019s tradition at this point!\n\nArtsyOwl: Hey, \u201cGloopy and Glitter\u201d are still in the reruns, too! Shimmering on\u2014quite literally, thanks to Glitter. It\u2019s a quirky and cute show, glad it\u2019s still around for the little ones to enjoy.\n\nBacteriophage_: Seeing World of Quest drop into the lineup makes me hopeful that Kids WB is dedicated to keeping variety alive. Adventure, humor, outright weirdness\u2014it\u2019s got it all. And combined with the educational fun from Ozzy & Drix, plus the game show laughs from Skatoony? Count me in for the summer!\n\nRestInToons: Sayonara superheroes! This season\u2019s lineup shows that kids\u2019 programming isn\u2019t just about capes and villains. It\u2019s about variety, surprise, and a touch of nostalgia. Let\u2019s get microscopic with Ozzy & Drix and go on a wild ride with Quest and Nestor!\n\nAmoebaAmy: Always a tad sad to see the Scooby gang go, but switching up genres keeps things interesting. Ozzy & Drix is kind of like \u201cThe Magic School Bus\u201d for the older crowd, and I\u2019m here for it! Plus, Skatoony is something my kids look forward to every year\u2014glad it\u2019s not going anywhere!\n\nScienceRules45: I\u2019ve got to say, I appreciate how Kids WB keeps mixing in educational content amidst all the comedy and action. Ozzy & Drix is a blast from the past that I\u2019m excited to revisit. It\u2019s just what we need in a world that could use a refresher on health and the human body!\n\nHappyMom200: World of Quest is an underrated treasure, and I\u2019m thrilled it\u2019s coming back into the spotlight. It\u2019s like that fun summer book series but animated. And Skatoony is practically synonymous with summer now; glad to know some things stay solid.\n\nAdmin5: The summer outlook is looking diverse and delightful! With shows that cater to every kind of young fan, there\u2019s no shortage of entertainment. Let\u2019s keep track of these changes and see how they fare in the warm months ahead.

The way they went about this was interesting, In December they started airing promos saying that from January 7 the network would be changing it\u2019s name, it didn\u2019t tell us that 4Kids are now in charge or that there would be new shows, the promo just showed the usual KWB shows like Squish, TAAB, TTG, XS, etc. Also today the promo for the next schedule change (dubbed a Super Duper Late Winter Lineup) has a new slogan \u201cYou\u2019re signed on to the CW4Kids\u201d Slow and painful rebrand? \ud83d\ude12, If you\u2019re not gonna change the bumpers untill Easter then why reveal your flashy new slogan now. Also the website (thecw4kids.com) STILL says this at the footer \u201c\u00a9 2024 Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Global, Nexstar Media Group\u201d Hopefully it is updated to reflect 4Kids\u2019s involvement soon. Write a follow up forum convo where they talk more about the slow transition, and that GoGoRiki is cute, and that it could be primed to take over most of the current comedy cartoons\nThread Title: CW4Kids: A Slow Transition & The Future of Cartoons on the Block? \ud83d\udd04\ud83d\udcfa\n\nToonMasterJay: So, has anyone else noticed how the CW4Kids transition is kinda like watching paint dry? The bumpers feel like Kids WB is haunting us. And they\u2019re dropping their new slogan already, but the website footer is still all about the old guard\u2026 Mixed signals much?\n\nDigitalToonFan: Yeah, the transition is definitely dragging its feet. I mean, if you\u2019re going to bring in 4Kids, then do it with a bang! Not this half-Zoom half-real-life meeting vibe. The new lineup switches could be cool though, but I\u2019ll miss Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers for sure.\n\nGoGoFan223: Honestly, I\u2019m most excited about GoGoRiki (or Smeshariki for the purists). It\u2019s cute and has that potential to be big with the comedy crowd. Less about the action and more laughs\u2014could be the perfect fit for the new direction they\u2019re aiming for.\n\nSonicXforever: Still processing the swap of Squish for Pok\u00e9mon and TAAB for Sonic X\u2026 I mean, sure, classics! But Sonic X has been rerun how many times now? I guess they\u2019re banking on that nostalgia factor to reel us in while they\u2019re redecorating.\n\nPokeNostalgia101: Not going to lie, I\u2019m excited to have Pok\u00e9mon Indigo League back\u2014it\u2019s like comfort food for my soul. But I hear you all, the change is weirdly slow. I get that it\u2019s a big shift from Kids WB to full-on 4Kids ownership, yet you\u2019d think they\u2019d want to make their mark quick.\n\nLyokoLover: Low-key glad Code Lyoko and Xiaolin Showdown are sticking around. They\u2019ve got that unique appeal that isn\u2019t easy to replace. But curious how long till that changes with this new \u201cSuper Duper Late Winter Lineup.\u201d If they\u2019re ushering out TTG and Scooby, who\u2019s next?\n\nAnimanga4Life: Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya coming to the block brings back fond Saturday morning memories! Although, I do get why some are skeptical; a lot of these shows have seen multiple reruns over the years.\n\nWebWader: I keep checking the website hoping it\u2019s been updated\u2026 No dice. The weird blend of old and new branding isn\u2019t helping anyone. At least update the footer to show 4Kids is steering the ship now. How hard can it be?\n\nComicStripKid: The lineup change feels like a balance between targeting the parents who grew up with these shows and trying to appeal to the new gen of cartoon fans. GoGoRiki\u2019s charm and simplicity could be their ticket into the latter\u2019s hearts. I see a mascot in the making.\n\nToonTalker91: Not thrilled about the slow pace here. It\u2019s like we\u2019re stuck in Kids WB limbo. I miss the days when a rebrand meant a fresh start, not this lingering goodbye. Curious how Gloopy and Glitter will fare with the rest of the changes looming\u2026 Will they be the last ones standing?\n\nAdmin_4KidsRevamp: Please bear with us during this transition. We\u2019re working hard to bring a fresh and exciting lineup while honoring the legacy of what came before. Believe us, it\u2019ll be worth the wait!

Nice to see they\u2019re stepping up their game with accounts and points, plus some games to boot!\n\nAnimanga4Life: 4Kids moving in with accounts and points? Sounds like they\u2019re setting up a cool rewards system. And that might just get more kids invested in the website beyond streaming shows\u2014a savvy move.\n\nGoGoFan223: GoGoRiki getting prime time with the big 4Kids dogs is great news. Its cute factor is off the charts. Could be the one to round out the new vibe CW4Kids is going for if they play their cards right.\n\nSonicXforever: Glad to see Sonic racing into the lineup. It\u2019s about time he got back into the limelight. Now to see how he fares among the newer offerings. Talk about a speed battle!\n\nPokeNostalgia101: Pok\u00e9mon getting its rightful place has me all fired up! But it\u2019s kinda odd to still see show pages for the ousted shows on the website. Anyone else notice that? Hopefully, they\u2019ll clear that up soon.\n\nLyokoLover: The fact that Code Lyoko is sticking around amidst all the changes shows its resilience. Maybe 4Kids recognizes the gold they have with some of these Kids WB shows. The perfect yin to their yang.\n\nComicStripKid: Well, can\u2019t say 4Kids isn\u2019t taking a balanced approach to this transition. Keeping half the lineup from Kids WB seems like a strategic way to ensure they don\u2019t lose the existing audience while they woo new viewers with nostalgia and updated features.\n\nWebWader: The website is getting there, slowly but surely. With account functionality and games, it looks like 4Kids is channeling some vintage interactivity magic. Here\u2019s to mission: engage the digitally-savvy generation!\n\nToonTalker91: Seeing \u201c\u00a9 2024 4Kids Entertainment\u201d at the bottom of the website gives me mixed emotions\u2014it\u2019s good to see they\u2019re updating stuff, but the nostalgia for Kids WB is real.

Hopefully, it adds a fresh vibe that resonates with the digital generation.\n\nPokeNostalgia101: Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series will def pull in the crowd looking for that cutting-edge anime action. Pok\u00e9mon always knows how to keep things fresh.\n\nLyokoLover: Sad to see some old friends go, but Code Lyoko holding strong gives me hope. It\u2019s like our own little slice of stability in this whirlwind of changes.\n\nComicStripKid: With the digital online style coming, CW4Kids is clearly gunning for a certain look and feel. Let\u2019s just cross our fingers it blends seamlessly with the cartoon essence we all tune in for.\n\nWebWader: Do you think bringing in Chaotic, TMNT, and Viva Pi\u00f1ata is going too far back into the vault? I\u2019m all for nostalgia, but I hope they still invest in newer properties or original content.

From April 17th, the final two bastions of the Kids WB legacy, Code Lyoko and \"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,\" are officially joining the 24/7 4Kids TV channel schedule. We're witnessing the full integration of Kids WB into the 4Kids entertainment universe.\n\nToonMasterJay: It\u2019s sort of bittersweet, isn\u2019t it? Kids WB has been a staple for so many of us, but seeing Code Lyoko and Gloopy & Glitter make their way onto 4Kids TV feels like the end of an era, yet the beginning of something new.\n\nAnimanga4Life: Definitely gives a sense of closure to the whole transition saga. Code Lyoko and Gloopy & Glitter were the holdouts, and now they're being folded into the 4Kids lineup, marking the complete merger. Exciting times, but nostalgic ones, too.\n\nGoGoFan223: It\u2019s intriguing to see how these shows will fit in with the 24/7 format of 4Kids TV. \"Gloopy and Glitter\" has that unique charm that could bring a fresh vibe to the channel, and Code Lyoko's deep storylines are unlike anything else in the 4Kids repertoire.\n\nSonicXforever: And let's not forget the implications this has for the channel's diversity in programming. Integrating shows from a channel like Kids WB means we're likely to see a broader range of content, appealing to both old fans and newcomers.\n\nPokeNostalgia101: This move also shows 4Kids's commitment to not just its own classics but embracing quality shows from other sources. Code Lyoko and \"Gloopy and Glitter\" are proof that great content can transcend its original home and thrive in a new space.\n\nLyokoLover: Code Lyoko has always had a dedicated fanbase, myself included. It\u2019s reassuring to know that 4Kids sees the value in keeping the show alive and accessible for both long-time fans and potentially a whole new audience.\n\nComicStripKid: Given the digital resonance of Code Lyoko and the whimsical nature of \u201cGloopy and Glitter,\u201d they could stand out as unique offerings on 4Kids TV. Here\u2019s hoping this brings more viewers to appreciate their uniqueness.\n\nWebWader: The full integration really solidifies the transition and could mark a new chapter for 4Kids as a channel. With a mix of action, adventure, and comedy, the lineup is looking more robust and varied than ever.\n\nToonTalker91: While it\u2019s the symbolic closing of the Kids WB chapter, it\u2019s uplifting to see 4Kids embracing these shows into their fold. The potential for crossover audiences is significant, and it could very well set the tone for future acquisitions and content strategy.\n\nAdmin_4KidsRevamp: We're excited to welcome the final Kids WB shows to the 4Kids TV family!

Does anyone know why this change happened?\n\n**User2: ClassicToonsRBest**\n\nYou're not alone in feeling this way, CartoonFanatic98. Kikoriki had a special kind of appeal with its quirky characters and the way it balanced fun storylines with life lessons. I'm hoping this is just a temporary change or maybe they're planning to bring Kikoriki back in a new time slot?\n\n**User3: ToonLover101**\n\nI heard from a friend that it might have to do with viewer numbers and trying to attract a different audience with Prank Patrol. Live-action content has been gaining traction, especially shows with interactive elements. Maybe they're experimenting?\n\n**User4: NostalgiaKid**\n\nExperimenting or not, you can't just replace Krash and his adventures like that! Where's Krash?

It's like removing a piece of CartoonLand's identity.\n\n**User5: ChannelInsider**\n\nFrom what I've gathered, channels undergo changes in their programming to keep the content fresh and engaging. It's possible Kikoriki might return in some form, maybe through reruns or even new episodes if we're lucky. Plus, Prank Patrol might bring in viewers who weren't previously engaged with the channel, broadening the audience. Still, I do understand the disappointment; it's tough when a favorite show is no longer part of the routine.\n\n**User6: ToonActivist**\n\nFor anyone really missing Kikoriki, there might be a solution. We could start a petition or a social media campaign to show CartoonLand how much we love the show.

Just look at the current programming\u2014BFDI, Squish, and Johnny Test, for example, have so many slots. Surely, it wouldn't hurt to adjust the schedule slightly to bring back Kikoriki.\n\nIt's not like we're asking for a complete overhaul. Just a slight tweak to ensure that there's a balance between the new offerings and the classics that made us fall in love with CartoonLand in the first place. Kikoriki has been such a significant part of the channel's identity, and it feels wrong to just phase it out without considering how its fans feel.\n\nI understand that channels need to refresh their content and that part of staying relevant is introducing new shows. But this doesn't have to happen at the expense of a show that has consistently brought joy and laughter to so many of us. There's a way to have the best of both worlds\u2014keeping the channel fresh while respecting its legacy and the audience's attachment to shows like Kikoriki.\n\nWhat does everyone else think?

Squish, as much as it had potential, really lost steam months ago. Honestly, it feels like it's just taking up space that could be better utilized by shows with more engagement, like bringing back beloved classics such as Kikoriki.\n\nI've noticed chatter across various forums and social media, and the consensus seems to be that Squish isn't holding the audience's attention like it used to. In comparison, shows like BFDI, Johnny Test, and even the newer additions have been consistently entertaining their audiences. They manage to keep us coming back for more, which can't really be said for Squish at this point.\n\nIt's not about disliking Squish for the sake of it, but when you look at the programming lineup, it's clear that the other shows are simply better in terms of content quality, engagement, and viewer feedback. Therefore, it might be time for CartoonLand to consider putting Squish out of its misery.\n\nThis isn't just about making room for Kikoriki, but about enhancing the overall quality of CartoonLand's programming.

Although, deep down, I'm hoping for a comeback of some of the classics we've been discussing here. Kikoriki, anyone?\n\n**User4: TheSpeculator**\nWhat about the voting competition that CartoonLand had a while back? Maybe the winner of that poll is what's taking the remaining slots.

Discuss!\"**\n\n**PixelMaster99**: Hey everyone! Just noticed CW4Kids updated their homepage banner. They've got 6 characters up there, each from a different show. I spotted Spectacular Spider-Man swinging in from the left. Classic pose with the web-slingers out!\n\n**ToonFanatic**: Ohh, I saw that! Right next to Spider-Man, they've got Jaden Yuki from Yu-Gi-Oh! GX holding a duel disk. It's pretty cool seeing him there, especially with the Elemental HERO Neos card projecting in front of him. Really captures the essence of the show.\n\n**ShellShock**: And don\u2019t miss out on Leonardo from TMNT: Fast Forward! He's front and center with those katanas ready for action. The futuristic background gives a nice touch that aligns with the \"Fast Forward\" theme.\n\n**CardCollector**: Did anyone else cheer a bit seeing Chaotic's Tom Majors (aka MajorTom) next? He's holding a scanner, and they've got Chaotic codes swirling around him. It's a small detail, but it really ties into the whole \"entering both the animated and live-action worlds of Chaotic\" vibe.\n\n**RabbitHopper**: Okay, but let's talk about the inclusion of Diggle from MoonGoons: Cosmic Capers! Having him with that giant carrot gearshift lever nods to their quirky adventures across the cosmos. It\u2019s a lighter touch compared to the others but an adorable addition!\n\n**SaturdayMornings**: Last but not least, they snuck Skunk from Skunk Fu! on the far right. Practicing his Dragon stance with a serene forest background, it contrasts nicely with the more \"intense\" characters. Shows the variety of what CW4Kids offers.\n\n**ToonTalker**: Does anyone feel like the choice of characters is a hint at what CW4Kids is prioritizing in their lineup? Spectacular Spider-Man and Leonardo definitely pull in the action-adventure crowd, while Jaden and Tom reach the strategic gamers. Skunk and Diggle add that imaginative, whimsical flavor.\n\n**PixelMaster99**: @ToonTalker, good point! Seems like they\u2019re aiming to appeal to a broad audience. Action, adventure, strategy, and whimsy. It's a smart move considering how diverse their viewer base is. Plus, each character is iconic in their own right, representing the best of their respective shows.\n\n**CardCollector**: Wonder if they\u2019ll rotate characters seasonally or if these will be the main mascots moving forward. Either way, it's a solid lineup that almost guarantees you\u2019ll stop and check out what\u2019s new on their site.\n\n**ShellShock**: Agreed! It definitely caught my attention. Hope they continue with updates like these to keep the site fresh and engaging. Maybe throw in some interactive features next?\n\n**RabbitHopper**: Interactive features would be amazing! Maybe mini-games related to each show? Anyway, loving the current banner. Shows that CW4Kids really knows their audience.\n\n**SaturdayMornings**: Totally! Love dissecting these updates with you all. Let\u2019s keep our eyes peeled for what\u2019s next!\n\n**ForumAdmin**: Just a reminder to keep the conversation friendly and respectful, folks.

CW4Kids just announced their new fall lineup starting September 13th, and it includes a *brand new show* called GoGoRiki! Plus, the full schedule from 7 am to 12 pm is out. Thoughts?\n\n**ToonFanatic**: Super excited for GoGoRiki! I caught a preview, and it looks like a blend of humor and adventure that'll fit right in. Also thrilled that The Spectacular Spider-Man is keeping its slot. \n\n**PixelMaster99**: Here\u2019s the full lineup for those who missed it:\n\n7:00 AM - The Spectacular Spider-Man\n- Peter Parker swinging into action to save New York from villains.\n\n7:30 AM - Tom and Jerry Tales\n- The classic cat and mouse chase never gets old!\n\n8:00 AM - GoGoRiki\n- The new kid on the block!

It shows the network has a lot of faith in its appeal. \n\n**CardCollector**: Yeah, @ToonTalker, positioning is everything. It's sandwiched between classics and fan favorites, so it's bound to get a lot of eyes. Curious to see how it resonates with the audience.\n\n**RabbitHopper**: Does anyone know if GoGoRiki is more comedy or adventure-focused? The previews gave me a bit of both vibes, which could be a fresh mix for the slot.\n\n**ShellShock**: @RabbitHopper, from what I've seen, it leans into both. The GoGoRiki world is zany but has moments of adventure and lessons. It\u2019s potentially a good balance that might attract a wider audience, especially those who enjoy light-hearted storylines with occasional thrills.\n\n**PixelMaster99**: Plus, with school back in session, GoGoRiki seems like the perfect addition for a bit of escapism before homework time. CW4Kids always had a knack for mixing educational elements with fun.\n\n**SaturdayMornings**: It\u2019s going to be an interesting season for sure. I\u2019m planning a weekly show discussion thread once the lineup kicks off. Would love for everyone here to join in and share your take on the new shows and episodes.\n\n**ForumAdmin**: Reminder to keep this space positive and informative.

There's been a major update regarding the CW4Kids fall lineup. It appears the initial lineup shared has been revamped to include more 4Kids classics, with notable additions like Dinosaur King and Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's. Only three KWB (Kids' WB) shows have been retained. Let's dive into the changes and what this means for our Saturday mornings!\n\n**ToonFanatic**: Whoa, that\u2019s a big shift! Always had a soft spot for Dinosaur King - can't wait to see it back on the air. As for Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's, it\u2019s great they\u2019re continuing with the Yu-Gi-Oh! legacy. Any word on which KWB shows are staying?\n\n**PixelMaster99**: Here's the **updated lineup** for those curious:\n\n7:00 AM - **Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D\u2019s**\n- Kickstarting our mornings with turbo-dueling action.

Another KWB survivor.\n\n9:30 AM - **Tom and Jerry Tales**\n- Classic cat and mouse antics continue in this KWB staple.\n\n10:00 AM - **GoGoRiki**\n- Seems like the new addition made the cut in this updated lineup.\n\n10:30 AM - **Chaotic**\n- Mix of animated adventure and card game strategy remains strong.\n\n11:00 AM - **Kirby: Right Back at Ya!**\n- Kirby\u2019s adventures in Dream Land offer a mix of action and humor.\n\n11:30 AM - **Viva Pi\u00f1ata**\n- Wrapping up the morning with colorful, fun-filled pi\u00f1ata adventures.\n\n**RabbitHopper**: Only three original KWB shows left? Wow, it's like the end of an era but the start of another. I'm especially pumped for Sonic X and TMNT \u2013 childhood favorites!\n\n**ShellShock**: Definitely an end and a beginning, @RabbitHopper. This lineup leans heavily into the adventure/action genre. I'm a bit surprised they kept GoGoRiki among such heavy hitters, but it\u2019s a nice variety.\n\n**CardCollector**: Surprised to see Viva Pi\u00f1ata in the lineup; it\u2019s quite different from the action-packed shows preceding it. Maybe it's their way of winding down the morning with something less intense?\n\n**ToonTalker**: It's clear CW4Kids aims to cater to a more action-oriented audience while keeping a balance with some classic KWB humor and charm. Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D\u2019s and Dinosaur King will definitely draw card game enthusiasts. \n\n**PixelMaster99**: Agreed, @ToonTalker. It's a lineup that seems to aim for a slightly older demographic, yet keeps elements that younger viewers can still enjoy. I'm intrigued by how this mix will be received. \n\n**SaturdayMornings**: As always, these transitions are exciting yet bittersweet.

In an unexpected turn of events, it looks like \"Tom and Jerry Tales\" is staying put in the CW4Kids lineup, despite the significant pivot towards 4Kids-centric programming. This has raised quite a few eyebrows, considering the push to move away from Warner Bros. Animation-produced content. What are your thoughts on this surprising decision?\n\n**ToonFanatic**: Honestly, I'm shocked but pleasantly so! \"Tom and Jerry\" is a timeless classic, but I was almost certain \"MoonGoons: Cosmic Capers\" would take over that slot, given the shift. It seems nostalgia and the universal appeal of the cat and mouse duo have triumphed.\n\n**PixelMaster99**: I see it as a strategic move. \"Tom and Jerry\" has such a broad, multi-generational appeal, it's like the bridge between the old and new CW4Kids. Plus, its comedic value is unmatched. Even 4Kids might've seen the merit in retaining that audience draw, even if it goes against the grain of their recent direction.\n\n**ShellShock**: Definitely a surprise! I was gearing up for more 4Kids exclusive content. While I\u2019ll miss having a more uniform lineup, it's hard to argue against the inclusion of \"Tom and Jerry.\" Their antics are legendary. It does make me wonder about the negotiations behind the scenes to keep them on board.\n\n**RabbitHopper**: I was rooting for \"MoonGoons: Cosmic Capers\" too, but \"Tom and Jerry\" is a safe bet for them. They cater to an audience that might not be as captivated by the more niche shows. Besides, it's so easy to just get lost in a \"Tom and Jerry\" marathon without realizing it. Maybe 4Kids is playing it safe while they test new waters?\n\n**CardCollector**: It's a double-edged sword. On one hand, you've got a tested-and-true formula with \"Tom and Jerry\" that guarantees viewers. On the other, how does it align with the vision 4Kids has for the channel? Were \"MoonGoons: Cosmic Capers\" seen as too much of a risk? Or is this indicative of a more subtle blend of content strategy? \n\n**ToonTalker**: There's also the aspect of brand recognition and syndication rights. \"Tom and Jerry\" are global icons, and keeping them might be more about maintaining that international appeal. The world loves these characters, and their value might outweigh the desire to completely revamp the lineup purely with 4Kids shows.\n\n**PixelMaster99**: Great points all around. It's fascinating to see \"Tom and Jerry\" defend their spot against the odds. It hints at flexibility in the CW4Kids strategy, possibly leaving room for legacy shows that have proven their worth. Only time will tell how this decision pans out and what it means for future programming decisions.\n\n**SaturdayMornings**: It's been an unexpected turn, but it's rekindling a great discussion on programming decisions and audience appeal. As always, let's stay tuned to see how it all unfolds. The new season is promising to be full of surprises!\n\n**ForumAdmin**: As this spirited discussion continues, let's remember to keep things respectful and open-minded. \"Tom and Jerry's\" enduring presence is a fascinating case study in programming strategies in the ever-changing landscape of children's television.\n\n**Thread Closed by Moderator**\n\n*Join us in our show-specific threads for episodic discussions and more!*"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a follow up where it's being replaced in 2 weeks, and you won't believe what's taking its spot"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**Thread Title: \"Major Update: 'Tom and Jerry' Leaving CW4Kids Lineup - You Won't Believe the Replacement!\"**\n\n**SaturdayMornings**: Hello, animation community! We have breaking news! After much speculation about the future of \"Tom and Jerry Tales\" in the CW4Kids lineup, it has just been announced that the show will be leaving in just two weeks. And guess what\u2019s taking its slot? It's not what anyone expected. Brace yourselves...\n\n**PixelMaster99**: Drumroll, please... It\u2019s \"Magi-Nation\"! That\u2019s right, the fantasy-themed animated series is making a comeback. After \u201cTom and Jerry\u201d holding the fort amidst a wave of new 4Kids programming, this replacement has left many of us scratching our heads. What\u2019s the strategy here?\n\n**ToonFanatic**: \"Magi-Nation\"? That's a deep cut from the vault! I mean, I loved the series, but it's a shift from slapstick comedy to fantasy adventure. Is CW4Kids trying to diversify or aiming for a different demographic altogether?\n\n**ShellShock**: Wow, did not see that coming. \"Magi-Nation\" has its charm, but it's a complete 180 from \"Tom and Jerry.\" There\u2019s a nostalgic factor, sure, but it's targeting a niche audience. Maybe CW4Kids is banking on reviving cult favorites as a new strategy?\n\n**RabbitHopper**: Honestly, I'm excited about \"Magi-Nation.\" But it's a gamble replacing a universally beloved show like \"Tom and Jerry\" with something that, while it has a devoted fan base, was never a mainstream hit. CW4Kids must be confident in their data or aiming for long-term brand evolution.\n\n**CardCollector**: \u201cMagi-Nation\u201d over \u201cTom and Jerry\u201d is a bold move. It signals a potential shift in programming philosophy. Are we witnessing the channel leaning heavily into fantasy and adventure genres? This could reshape Saturday morning dynamics entirely.\n\n**ToonTalker**: It is surprising, but there may be logic behind the madness. \u201cMagi-Nation\u201d offers extensive world-building and storytelling depth, which could engage viewers on a different level compared to the episodic antics of \"Tom and Jerry.\" Plus, it might attract fans of strategy and role-play games, aligning more with other shows like \"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D\u2019s\" and \"Dinosaur King.\"\n\n**PixelMaster99**: That's a valid point, @ToonTalker. Shifting towards more narrative-driven programming could indeed be the goal. Still, \"Tom and Jerry's\" broad appeal is hard to replace. It'll be fascinating to see how this gamble pays off for CW4Kids in terms of viewer retention and ratings.\n\n**SaturdayMornings**: Truly an unexpected twist in the tale of CW4Kids' evolution! Let\u2019s give \"Magi-Nation\" a chance to cast its spell. Meanwhile, let\u2019s cherish the last few episodes with our beloved cat-and-mouse duo. Share your favorite \"Tom and Jerry\" moments and what you're looking forward to with \"Magi-Nation.\"\n\n**ForumAdmin**: Reminder to all: Let's keep the discussion respectful and constructive.

Discuss!\u201d\n\nPixelMaster99: Hey everyone! Just noticed CW4Kids updated their homepage banner. They\u2019ve got 6 characters up there, each from a different show. I spotted Spectacular Spider-Man swinging in from the left. Classic pose with the web-slingers out!\n\nToonFanatic: Ohh, I saw that! Right next to Spider-Man, they\u2019ve got Jaden Yuki from Yu-Gi-Oh! GX holding a duel disk. It\u2019s pretty cool seeing him there, especially with the Elemental HERO Neos card projecting in front of him. Really captures the essence of the show.\n\nShellShock: And don\u2019t miss out on Leonardo from TMNT: Fast Forward! He\u2019s front and center with those katanas ready for action. The futuristic background gives a nice touch that aligns with the \u201cFast Forward\u201d theme.\n\nCardCollector: Did anyone else cheer a bit seeing Chaotic\u2019s Tom Majors (aka MajorTom) next? He\u2019s holding a scanner, and they\u2019ve got Chaotic codes swirling around him. It\u2019s a small detail, but it really ties into the whole \u201centering both the animated and live-action worlds of Chaotic\u201d vibe.\n\nRabbitHopper: Okay, but let\u2019s talk about the inclusion of Diggle from MoonGoons: Cosmic Capers! Having him with that giant carrot gearshift lever nods to their quirky adventures across the cosmos. It\u2019s a lighter touch compared to the others but an adorable addition!\n\nSaturdayMornings: Last but not least, they snuck Skunk from Skunk Fu! on the far right. Practicing his Dragon stance with a serene forest background, it contrasts nicely with the more \u201cintense\u201d characters. Shows the variety of what CW4Kids offers.\n\nToonTalker: Does anyone feel like the choice of characters is a hint at what CW4Kids is prioritizing in their lineup? Spectacular Spider-Man and Leonardo definitely pull in the action-adventure crowd, while Jaden and Tom reach the strategic gamers. Skunk and Diggle add that imaginative, whimsical flavor.\n\nPixelMaster99: @ToonTalker, good point! Seems like they\u2019re aiming to appeal to a broad audience. Action, adventure, strategy, and whimsy. It\u2019s a smart move considering how diverse their viewer base is. Plus, each character is iconic in their own right, representing the best of their respective shows.\n\nCardCollector: Wonder if they\u2019ll rotate characters seasonally or if these will be the main mascots moving forward. Either way, it\u2019s a solid lineup that almost guarantees you\u2019ll stop and check out what\u2019s new on their site.\n\nShellShock: Agreed! It definitely caught my attention. Hope they continue with updates like these to keep the site fresh and engaging. Maybe throw in some interactive features next?\n\nRabbitHopper: Interactive features would be amazing! Maybe mini-games related to each show? Anyway, loving the current banner. Shows that CW4Kids really knows their audience.\n\nSaturdayMornings: Totally! Love dissecting these updates with you all. Let\u2019s keep our eyes peeled for what\u2019s next!\n\nForumAdmin: Just a reminder to keep the conversation friendly and respectful, folks.

CW4Kids just announced their new fall lineup starting September 13th, and it includes a brand new show called GoGoRiki! Plus, the full schedule from 7 am to 12 pm is out. Thoughts?\n\nToonFanatic: Super excited for GoGoRiki! I caught a preview, and it looks like a blend of humor and adventure that\u2019ll fit right in. Also thrilled that The Spectacular Spider-Man is keeping its slot.\n\nPixelMaster99: Here\u2019s the full lineup for those who missed it:\n\n7:00 AM - The Spectacular Spider-Man\n- Peter Parker swinging into action to save New York from villains.\n\n7:30 AM - Tom and Jerry Tales\n- The classic cat and mouse chase never gets old!\n\n8:00 AM - GoGoRiki\n- The new kid on the block! An animated series focused on the adventures and antics of the GoGoRiki crew.\n\n8:30 AM - TMNT: Fast Forward\n- More futuristic ninja action with the turtle brothers.\n\n9:00 AM - Yu-Gi-Oh! GX\n- Jaden and friends are back for more dueling action.\n\n9:30 AM - Chaotic\n- The mix of live-action and animation is really cool, plus, who doesn\u2019t love a good card game battleground?\n\n10:00 AM - Skunk Fu!\n- Our favorite skunk continues to learn and fight with his unique style of martial arts.\n\n10:30 AM - The Batman\n- Continuing to delve into the early years of our favorite dark knight.\n\n11:00 AM - Xiaolin Showdown\n- The quest for Shen Gong Wu continues!\n\n11:30 AM - MoonGoons: Cosmic Capers\n- Boofus and Diggle\u2019s adventures are a great way to wrap up the morning.\n\nToonTalker: Interesting they placed GoGoRiki at 8:00 AM, right in the heart of the lineup. It shows the network has a lot of faith in its appeal.\n\nCardCollector: Yeah, @ToonTalker, positioning is everything. It\u2019s sandwiched between classics and fan favorites, so it\u2019s bound to get a lot of eyes. Curious to see how it resonates with the audience.\n\nRabbitHopper: Does anyone know if GoGoRiki is more comedy or adventure-focused? The previews gave me a bit of both vibes, which could be a fresh mix for the slot.\n\nShellShock: @RabbitHopper, from what I\u2019ve seen, it leans into both. The GoGoRiki world is zany but has moments of adventure and lessons. It\u2019s potentially a good balance that might attract a wider audience, especially those who enjoy light-hearted storylines with occasional thrills.\n\nPixelMaster99: Plus, with school back in session, GoGoRiki seems like the perfect addition for a bit of escapism before homework time. CW4Kids always had a knack for mixing educational elements with fun.\n\nSaturdayMornings: It\u2019s going to be an interesting season for sure. I\u2019m planning a weekly show discussion thread once the lineup kicks off. Would love for everyone here to join in and share your take on the new shows and episodes.\n\nForumAdmin: Reminder to keep this space positive and informative. Excited to see the community come together over the new lineup. Let\u2019s gear up for an amazing fall season with CW4Kids!\n\nToonFanatic: Count me in for the discussions, @SaturdayMornings!

Sad to see some of the old favorites go, but this lineup packs a punch with action and adventure.\n\nCardCollector: Definitely a shift towards a more action-packed morning. \u201cChaotic\u201d and \u201cYu-Gi-Oh! GX\u201d staying gives us a solid dose of strategy and competition, while \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d keeps the whimsical charm alive amidst the thrillers.\n\nRabbitHopper: It feels bittersweet. I\u2019ll miss the old Kids WB essence, but I\u2019m curious about \u201cDinosaur King.\u201d It has the potential to become a new favorite for dino enthusiasts and adventure seekers alike.\n\nShellShock: \u201cTMNT: Fast Forward\u201d and \u201cThe Batman\u201d hanging on shows there\u2019s still room for superhero and action themes from the WB legacy. It's interesting to see how they'll blend with the newer, 4Kids dominated lineup.\n\nSaturdayMornings: Definitely marks the end of an era and the start of a new direction for CW4Kids. I\u2019m up for giving the new shows a chance, especially \u201cYu-Gi-Oh! 5D's\u201d with its unique blend of dueling and futuristic storytelling.\n\nForumAdmin: As always, let\u2019s approach these changes with an open mind and support the shows and characters we love.

Amidst the influx of 4Kids-centric content, \u201cThe Batman\u201d remains a staple. Let's delve into why this show continues to secure its slot in a rapidly evolving Saturday morning landscape.\n\nPixelMaster99: I think one of the key reasons \u201cThe Batman\u201d remains is its universal appeal. Batman as a character has a vast following across various age groups, not to mention the character's rich history and depth which makes it a draw for both kids and adults. \n\nToonFanatic: Agreed, @PixelMaster99. Also, \u201cThe Batman\u201d brings a unique blend of action, detective work, and psychological depth that isn\u2019t found in many other cartoons. It\u2019s a show that can introduce younger audiences to a more nuanced view of heroism and villainy, wrapped in high-octane action.\n\nCardCollector: Don't forget the merchandising aspect! Batman is a commercial powerhouse. From action figures to video games, the Dark Knight has a significant presence in retail. Keeping the show on air supports that ecosystem, driving both viewership and merchandise sales.\n\nRabbitHopper: It's also about brand equity. Batman as a brand is incredibly valuable. By continuing to broadcast \u201cThe Batman,\u201d CW4Kids benefits from that brand\u2019s halo effect. It adds a sense of prestige and pulls in viewers simply based on the name recognition.\n\nShellShock: On a more content-focused note, \u201cThe Batman\u201d offers something that not many shows can - a bridge between old and new. It respects the legacy of Batman while introducing innovative stories and character arcs. This balance between tradition and novelty might be another key to its staying power.\n\nSaturdayMornings: Those are all compelling points. It also speaks volumes about the storytelling quality of \u201cThe Batman.\u201d Despite the changing tides, a well-crafted narrative with complex characters can stand the test of time and shifts in network priorities.\n\nToonTalker: Moreover, the show has done an excellent job of making Batman accessible to younger viewers without diluting the darker aspects that make the character so fascinating. This delicate balancing act likely contributes to its endurance in a network increasingly dominated by 4Kids programming.\n\nPixelMaster99: Lastly, it could simply boil down to the show's performance. If it's pulling in decent viewership numbers and engaging the audience effectively, there's no reason for the network to pull the plug. In the end, TV is a business, and \u201cThe Batman\u201d seems to be holding its own.\n\nForumAdmin: This discussion highlights the multifaceted reasons behind \u201cThe Batman\u2019s\u201d continued presence on CW4Kids. From appealing to a wide audience to leveraging Batman\u2019s brand power\u2014it seems the caped crusader still has a lot to offer to Saturday morning viewers.

Looks like there\u2019s been another change in our Saturday morning lineup. \u201cThe Batman\u201d has officially been replaced by \u201cViva Pi\u00f1ata.\u201d Along with this update, CW4Kids just launched a Comedy Trio promo, celebrating the three major comedic shows that are now brightening our weekends. Let\u2019s dive into these bubbly waters and discuss!\n\nPixelMaster99: Whoa, didn\u2019t see that coming! I mean, \u201cViva Pi\u00f1ata\u201d is a total 180 from the gritty streets of Gotham. But hey, variety is the spice of life, right? This Comedy Trio promo thing sounds intriguing. Which shows are they highlighting?\n\nToonFanatic: The Comedy Trio consists of \u201cViva Pi\u00f1ata,\u201d \u201cGoGoRiki,\u201d and \u201cChaotic.\u201d Each brings its own flavor of humor to the mix. \u201cViva Pi\u00f1ata\u201d with its colorful, candy-filled world; \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d offering quirky stories and character-driven laughs; and \u201cChaotic,\u201d which blends action with comedic elements seamlessly. \n\nCardCollector: \u201cViva Pi\u00f1ata\u201d is such a vibrant show. It\u2019s got that lighthearted, feel-good vibe that can really draw in a younger audience. Plus, the world-building is fascinating\u2014pi\u00f1atas living in a paradise, each episode uncovering more about their quirky ecosystem. A stark contrast to \u201cThe Batman,\u201d but a welcome addition for those early weekend mornings.\n\nRabbitHopper: Honestly, this shift towards lighter, comedic content is refreshing. While \u201cThe Batman\u201d had its appeal, \u201cViva Pi\u00f1ata\u201d has this magical ability to transport you to a world where the biggest worry is whether Fergy Fudgehog will make it to a party. And bundling it with \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d and \u201cChaotic\u201d in promos? Genius. It creates a solid block that promises pure entertainment and laughter.\n\nShellShock: I caught the Comedy Trio promo, and it\u2019s brilliantly put together. They\u2019ve managed to highlight memorable, hilarious moments from each show, promising a fun-packed morning. It\u2019s a smart move, emphasizing that Saturdays are not just for adventures in distant galaxies or superhero showdowns but also for cracking up on the couch.\n\nSaturdayMornings: Does anyone else think that this might be the network\u2019s strategy to widen their audience base? \u201cViva Pi\u00f1ata\u201d and the Comedy Trio could really appeal to both the younger kids and those looking for something light and funny to start their weekend.\n\nToonTalker: Definitely, @SaturdayMornings. \u201cViva Pi\u00f1ata\u201d is the kind of show that doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously, which is perfect for unwinding. Coupled with \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d and \u201cChaotic,\u201d it forms this trifecta of fun that can cater to viewers who just want to laugh and have a good time. Plus, the humor in these shows has enough layers to keep even the older viewers entertained.\n\nPixelMaster99: It\u2019s going to be interesting to see how this shift affects the lineup's dynamic. I\u2019m all in for giving \u201cViva Pi\u00f1ata\u201d a chance to grow on me.

So, we've all seen the new Comedy Trio promo featuring \u201cViva Pi\u00f1ata,\u201d \u201cGoGoRiki,\u201d and surprisingly, \u201cChaotic.\u201d While the first two are undoubtedly comedic gems, \u201cChaotic\u201d being grouped with them has sparked some curiosity. Isn\u2019t \u201cChaotic\u201d more of an action-packed adventure show? Let\u2019s discuss why it might have made its way into the comedy lineup.\n\nPixelMaster99: You\u2019ve got a point there. At first glance, \u201cChaotic\u201d indeed leans more towards action and adventure, especially with its unique premise of transporting players into an alternate reality to battle alongside their creatures. But thinking back, there are quite a few episodes sprinkled with humor, mainly through character interactions and unexpected situations.\n\nToonFanatic: True, @PixelMaster99. The dynamics between the main characters can be pretty hilarious. Tom\u2019s reactions to Kaz's schemes or Peyton\u2019s comedic timing bring a lighter side to \u201cChaotic.\u201d Maybe the network is trying to highlight that even action shows can have their moments of levity, broadening the appeal of \u201cChaotic\u201d to fans of comedy.\n\nCardCollector: Plus, let\u2019s not forget the Misplays of the Day at the end of some episodes. Those segments specifically put a spotlight on the lighter, often funnier moments in \u201cChaotic\u201d battles. It seems like CW4Kids might be using \u201cChaotic\u201d to blend genres within the Comedy Trio, showing that humor can be found even in the most intense adventures.\n\nRabbitHopper: Honestly, including \u201cChaotic\u201d in the Comedy Trio could also be a strategic move to diversify the block. It's a nod to viewers who love action but appreciate the occasional comic relief. It says, \"Hey, we've got all your bases covered on Saturday mornings!\"\n\nShellShock: That\u2019s an insightful observation, @RabbitHopper. Integrating \u201cChaotic\u201d with \u201cViva Pi\u00f1ata\u201d and \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d showcases the network's commitment to variety. By blurring the lines between genres, CW4Kids could be encouraging viewers to try something new, expanding their tastes beyond what they typically watch.\n\nSaturdayMornings: It\u2019s also possible that \u201cChaotic\u201d offers a type of humor that's different from the slapstick or situational comedy in \u201cViva Pi\u00f1ata\u201d and \u201cGoGoRiki.\u201d This inclusion might simply be CW4Kids' way of highlighting the diverse flavors of comedy across their shows, including those with action-packed narratives.\n\nToonTalker: Still, it\u2019s interesting to consider how the perception of \u201cChaotic\u201d might change with this promo. Viewers tuning in for a laugh might discover the depth and excitement of the \u201cChaotic\u201d universe, while fans of the show could find themselves appreciating the comedic elements more.\n\nPixelMaster99: All in all, it seems like a clever way to mix things up and perhaps even redefine what a \u201ccomedy show\u201d can entail. CW4Kids is pushing the boundaries, blending genres to create a more enriching Saturday morning experience for everyone.\n\nForumAdmin: Fascinating points, everyone! The inclusion of \u201cChaotic\u201d in the Comedy Trio promo definitely provides food for thought about the evolving definitions of genre and entertainment.

Have you guys checked out the latest update on the CW4Kids website? They\u2019ve revamped the homepage and it now prominently features two major sections: \u201cBig Action Shows\u201d and \u201c3 Big Lighthearted Shows.\u201d This new layout seems to cement the network's commitment to offering a balanced mix of high-octane adventure and feel-good entertainment. Let's dive into this update and share our thoughts!\n\nPixelMaster99: Just saw the update! The \u201cBig Action Shows\u201d section is pretty epic. It\u2019s got \u201cYu-Gi-Oh! 5D's,\u201d \u201cTMNT: Fast Forward,\u201d and \u201cSonic X\u201d leading the pack.

Each banner in this section has bright colors and fun imagery, promising a good time. It definitely appeals to viewers looking for a more laid-back watch.\n\nCardCollector: The website\u2019s layout is a smart move. By clearly distinguishing between the action-packed and the lighthearted shows, CW4Kids is making it easier for audiences to navigate to their preferred content. Also, the fact that they\u2019re promoting these shows this way suggests they're confident in their appeal and audience segments.\n\nRabbitHopper: Noticed that each show\u2019s page got a bit of an overhaul too? There\u2019s now quick access to episode guides, character bios, and even some games related to the shows. It\u2019s like CW4Kids is not just showcasing these shows but creating an immersive experience around them. Engaging for both the action aficionados and those in it for the laughs.\n\nShellShock: I'm particularly impressed with how they're leveraging the website to complement the Saturday morning lineup. Having these sections highlighted on the homepage possibly indicates a strategic move to cater to diverse viewer preferences while also possibly attracting a broader audience by showcasing the range of their programming.\n\nSaturdayMornings: Does anyone else think this might impact viewer trends? With such clear categorization, fans might be more inclined to explore shows they hadn\u2019t considered before. Those usually tuning in for \u201cTMNT: Fast Forward\u201d might give \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d a chance, and vice versa. It\u2019s a clever way of cross-promoting shows within their lineup.\n\nToonTalker: Exactly, @SaturdayMornings. This layout could encourage viewers to step out of their comfort zones.

Big news just dropped on the network\u2019s official page \u2013 they are officially promoting a lineup of \u201cAll 4 Lighthearted Shows,\u201d putting a spotlight on the funnier, more playful side of their programming. Interestingly, \u201cChaotic\u201d has made the list again, but this time they specifically mention \u201cChaotic (Port Court/On Earth scenes).\u201d Let\u2019s chat about this intriguing focus and what it adds to the lighthearted lineup. \n\nPixelMaster99: Noticed that! Highlighting the \u201cPort Court/On Earth scenes\u201d from \u201cChaotic\u201d is a clever move. Those segments really capture the everyday hilarities and mishaps of the characters away from the high-stakes action of Perim. It brings a whole new dimension to how we perceive \u201cChaotic\u201d as part of this joyful quartet.\n\nToonFanatic: Exactly, @PixelMaster99! Including \u201cChaotic\u201d by specifying the \"Port Court/On Earth scenes\" shows they\u2019re keen on showcasing the duality of the show. While \u201cChaotic\u201d has its thrilling action in Perim, its Earth scenes often bring a lighter, comedic relief that fits perfectly in the lighthearted lineup. \n\nCardCollector: This nuanced approach could really broaden the show's appeal. Fans of the action-packed duels in Perim might find themselves enjoying the everyday adventures and laughs that come from the more relatable Earth scenes. It\u2019s a smart way to draw in viewers who might prefer comedy over action.\n\nRabbitHopper: And let\u2019s not forget the other three shows making up the lighthearted lineup! \u201cViva Pi\u00f1ata,\u201d \u201cGoGoRiki,\u201d and the newly added \u201cKooky Cookery\u201d (just making up a fun show here) each bring their unique brand of humor and whimsy. \u201cChaotic (Port Court/On Earth scenes)\u201d complements them nicely, rounding out a diverse selection of feel-good entertainment.\n\nShellShock: It\u2019s intriguing to see a network actively promote the multifaceted nature of a show like \u201cChaotic.\u201d By highlighting segments like \u201cPort Court/On Earth,\u201d CW4Kids is effectively saying, \u201cHey, we have shows that can make you laugh and keep you on the edge of your seat!\u201d It\u2019s a testament to the variety they\u2019re striving for.\n\nSaturdayMornings: Absolutely, @ShellShock! This inclusion not only underlines the show's versatility but also reinforces CW4Kids' dedication to offering a rich palette of programming. It demonstrates an understanding that their audience craves a mix of genres and experiences, even within a single viewing slot.\n\nToonTalker: It'd be interesting to see if this strategic highlighting of \u201cChaotic\u2019s\u201d lighter scenes influences other action-oriented shows to feature their more comedic aspects. Could pave the way for a new form of storytelling in kids' programming where action and humor aren't seen as separate entities but rather complementary layers that enrich a show.\n\nPixelMaster99: Agreed, @ToonTalker. This approach has the potential to reshape expectations and appreciation for the depth that children\u2019s programming can offer. Kudos to CW4Kids for being at the forefront of this shift.

Discuss!\u201d\n\nPixelMaster99: Hey everyone! Just noticed CW4Kids updated their homepage banner. They\u2019ve got 6 characters up there, each from a different show. I spotted Spectacular Spider-Man swinging in from the left. Classic pose with the web-slingers out!\n\nToonFanatic: Ohh, I saw that! Right next to Spider-Man, they\u2019ve got Jaden Yuki from Yu-Gi-Oh! GX holding a duel disk. It\u2019s pretty cool seeing him there, especially with the Elemental HERO Neos card projecting in front of him. Really captures the essence of the show.\n\nShellShock: And don\u2019t miss out on Leonardo from TMNT: Fast Forward! He\u2019s front and center with those katanas ready for action. The futuristic background gives a nice touch that aligns with the \u201cFast Forward\u201d theme.\n\nCardCollector: Did anyone else cheer a bit seeing Chaotic\u2019s Tom Majors (aka MajorTom) next? He\u2019s holding a scanner, and they\u2019ve got Chaotic codes swirling around him. It\u2019s a small detail, but it really ties into the whole \u201centering both the animated and live-action worlds of Chaotic\u201d vibe.\n\nRabbitHopper: Okay, but let\u2019s talk about the inclusion of Diggle from MoonGoons: Cosmic Capers! Having him with that giant carrot gearshift lever nods to their quirky adventures across the cosmos. It\u2019s a lighter touch compared to the others but an adorable addition!\n\nSaturdayMornings: Last but not least, they snuck Skunk from Skunk Fu! on the far right. Practicing his Dragon stance with a serene forest background, it contrasts nicely with the more \u201cintense\u201d characters. Shows the variety of what CW4Kids offers.\n\nToonTalker: Does anyone feel like the choice of characters is a hint at what CW4Kids is prioritizing in their lineup? Spectacular Spider-Man and Leonardo definitely pull in the action-adventure crowd, while Jaden and Tom reach the strategic gamers. Skunk and Diggle add that imaginative, whimsical flavor.\n\nPixelMaster99: @ToonTalker, good point! Seems like they\u2019re aiming to appeal to a broad audience. Action, adventure, strategy, and whimsy. It\u2019s a smart move considering how diverse their viewer base is. Plus, each character is iconic in their own right, representing the best of their respective shows.\n\nCardCollector: Wonder if they\u2019ll rotate characters seasonally or if these will be the main mascots moving forward. Either way, it\u2019s a solid lineup that almost guarantees you\u2019ll stop and check out what\u2019s new on their site.\n\nShellShock: Agreed! It definitely caught my attention. Hope they continue with updates like these to keep the site fresh and engaging. Maybe throw in some interactive features next?\n\nRabbitHopper: Interactive features would be amazing! Maybe mini-games related to each show? Anyway, loving the current banner. Shows that CW4Kids really knows their audience.\n\nSaturdayMornings: Totally! Love dissecting these updates with you all. Let\u2019s keep our eyes peeled for what\u2019s next!\n\nForumAdmin: Just a reminder to keep the conversation friendly and respectful, folks.

CW4Kids just announced their new fall lineup starting September 13th, and it includes a brand new show called GoGoRiki! Plus, the full schedule from 7 am to 12 pm is out. Thoughts?\n\nToonFanatic: Super excited for GoGoRiki! I caught a preview, and it looks like a blend of humor and adventure that\u2019ll fit right in. Also thrilled that The Spectacular Spider-Man is keeping its slot.\n\nPixelMaster99: Here\u2019s the full lineup for those who missed it:\n\n7:00 AM - The Spectacular Spider-Man\n- Peter Parker swinging into action to save New York from villains.\n\n7:30 AM - Tom and Jerry Tales\n- The classic cat and mouse chase never gets old!\n\n8:00 AM - GoGoRiki\n- The new kid on the block!

GX\n- Jaden and friends are back for more dueling action.\n\n9:30 AM - Chaotic\n- The mix of live-action and animation is really cool, plus, who doesn\u2019t love a good card game battleground?\n\n10:00 AM - Skunk Fu!\n- Our favorite skunk continues to learn and fight with his unique style of martial arts.\n\n10:30 AM - The Batman\n- Continuing to delve into the early years of our favorite dark knight.\n\n11:00 AM - Xiaolin Showdown\n- The quest for Shen Gong Wu continues!\n\n11:30 AM - MoonGoons: Cosmic Capers\n- Boofus and Diggle\u2019s adventures are a great way to wrap up the morning.\n\nToonTalker: Interesting they placed GoGoRiki at 8:00 AM, right in the heart of the lineup. It shows the network has a lot of faith in its appeal.\n\nCardCollector: Yeah, @ToonTalker, positioning is everything. It\u2019s sandwiched between classics and fan favorites, so it\u2019s bound to get a lot of eyes. Curious to see how it resonates with the audience.\n\nRabbitHopper: Does anyone know if GoGoRiki is more comedy or adventure-focused? The previews gave me a bit of both vibes, which could be a fresh mix for the slot.\n\nShellShock: @RabbitHopper, from what I\u2019ve seen, it leans into both. The GoGoRiki world is zany but has moments of adventure and lessons. It\u2019s potentially a good balance that might attract a wider audience, especially those who enjoy light-hearted storylines with occasional thrills.\n\nPixelMaster99: Plus, with school back in session, GoGoRiki seems like the perfect addition for a bit of escapism before homework time. CW4Kids always had a knack for mixing educational elements with fun.\n\nSaturdayMornings: It\u2019s going to be an interesting season for sure. I\u2019m planning a weekly show discussion thread once the lineup kicks off. Would love for everyone here to join in and share your take on the new shows and episodes.\n\nForumAdmin: Reminder to keep this space positive and informative. Excited to see the community come together over the new lineup. Let\u2019s gear up for an amazing fall season with CW4Kids!\n\nToonFanatic: Count me in for the discussions, @SaturdayMornings!

Just saw the latest announcement about the fall lineup starting September 13th. It seems there\u2019s been a significant shift toward 4Kids-centric shows. We\u2019ve got \u201cDinosaur King,\u201d \u201cYu-Gi-Oh! 5D\u2019s,\u201d and much more. Looks like we\u2019re entering a new era with only three original Kids WB shows remaining.

Sad to see some of the old favorites go, but this lineup packs a punch with action and adventure.\n\nCardCollector: Definitely a shift towards a more action-packed morning. \u201cChaotic\u201d and \u201cYu-Gi-Oh! GX\u201d staying gives us a solid dose of strategy and competition, while \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d keeps the whimsical charm alive amidst the thrillers.\n\nRabbitHopper: It feels bittersweet. I\u2019ll miss the old Kids WB essence, but I\u2019m curious about \u201cDinosaur King.\u201d It has the potential to become a new favorite for dino enthusiasts and adventure seekers alike.\n\nShellShock: \u201cTMNT: Fast Forward\u201d and \u201cThe Batman\u201d hanging on shows there\u2019s still room for superhero and action themes from the WB legacy. It\u2019s interesting to see how they\u2019ll blend with the newer, 4Kids dominated lineup.\n\nSaturdayMornings: Definitely marks the end of an era and the start of a new direction for CW4Kids. I\u2019m up for giving the new shows a chance, especially \u201cYu-Gi-Oh! 5D\u2019s\u201d with its unique blend of dueling and futuristic storytelling.\n\nForumAdmin: As always, let\u2019s approach these changes with an open mind and support the shows and characters we love. Looking forward to hearing everyone\u2019s thoughts on the new lineup as it rolls out!\n\nThread Closed by Moderator\n\nStay tuned for updates and discussions on the unfolding CW4Kids fall season!\nWrite a follow up wondering why Batman is still here\nThread Title: \u201cThe Batman: Why It Still Holds a Spot in CW4Kids\u2019 Action-Packed Lineup?\u201d\n\nSaturdayMornings: Hey everyone, with the recent shakeup in the CW4Kids lineup, it\u2019s been fascinating to see which shows from the original Kids WB roster have made the cut. Amidst the influx of 4Kids-centric content, \u201cThe Batman\u201d remains a staple. Let\u2019s delve into why this show continues to secure its slot in a rapidly evolving Saturday morning landscape.\n\nPixelMaster99: I think one of the key reasons \u201cThe Batman\u201d remains is its universal appeal. Batman as a character has a vast following across various age groups, not to mention the character\u2019s rich history and depth which makes it a draw for both kids and adults.\n\nToonFanatic: Agreed, @PixelMaster99. Also, \u201cThe Batman\u201d brings a unique blend of action, detective work, and psychological depth that isn\u2019t found in many other cartoons. It\u2019s a show that can introduce younger audiences to a more nuanced view of heroism and villainy, wrapped in high-octane action.\n\nCardCollector: Don\u2019t forget the merchandising aspect! Batman is a commercial powerhouse. From action figures to video games, the Dark Knight has a significant presence in retail. Keeping the show on air supports that ecosystem, driving both viewership and merchandise sales.\n\nRabbitHopper: It\u2019s also about brand equity. Batman as a brand is incredibly valuable. By continuing to broadcast \u201cThe Batman,\u201d CW4Kids benefits from that brand\u2019s halo effect. It adds a sense of prestige and pulls in viewers simply based on the name recognition.\n\nShellShock: On a more content-focused note, \u201cThe Batman\u201d offers something that not many shows can - a bridge between old and new. It respects the legacy of Batman while introducing innovative stories and character arcs. This balance between tradition and novelty might be another key to its staying power.\n\nSaturdayMornings: Those are all compelling points. It also speaks volumes about the storytelling quality of \u201cThe Batman.\u201d Despite the changing tides, a well-crafted narrative with complex characters can stand the test of time and shifts in network priorities.\n\nToonTalker: Moreover, the show has done an excellent job of making Batman accessible to younger viewers without diluting the darker aspects that make the character so fascinating. This delicate balancing act likely contributes to its endurance in a network increasingly dominated by 4Kids programming.\n\nPixelMaster99: Lastly, it could simply boil down to the show\u2019s performance. If it\u2019s pulling in decent viewership numbers and engaging the audience effectively, there\u2019s no reason for the network to pull the plug. In the end, TV is a business, and \u201cThe Batman\u201d seems to be holding its own.\n\nForumAdmin: This discussion highlights the multifaceted reasons behind \u201cThe Batman\u2019s\u201d continued presence on CW4Kids. From appealing to a wide audience to leveraging Batman\u2019s brand power\u2014it seems the caped crusader still has a lot to offer to Saturday morning viewers.

It brands these shows as the core of CW4Kids\u2019 comedic content. \u201cViva Pi\u00f1ata\u201d has that mix of humor and light-heartedness that could attract families looking for content that\u2019s enjoyable for both kids and parents. Plus, it\u2019s always great to have more variety in the mix.\n\nShellShock: Definitely a drastic change, but \u201cViva Pi\u00f1ata\u201d offers something unique.

They\u2019ve clarified that \u201cChaotic\u201d shifts gears between action and comedy, highlighting that it\u2019s mainly action-packed during the battle dromes or when the scene is in Perim. However, it adopts a lighter, comedic tone during segments set in the Port Court or on Earth. Also, it seems we've all missed acknowledging another comedic show in the lineup that's been with us through all the changes. How did we overlook it?\n\nPixelMaster99: That\u2019s an interesting clarification about \u201cChaotic.\u201d It does have those moments of levity, especially with the character interactions in the non-battle scenes. It\u2019s a nice blend that probably broadens its appeal. And how could we forget about \u201cSkunk Fu!\u201d? It's been delivering laughs with its unique brand of humor and martial arts shenanigans. Definitely deserves a spot in the comedic lineup discussions.\n\nToonFanatic: True, \u201cSkunk Fu!\u201d has that light-hearted charm mixed with action. It\u2019s been consistent in delivering both humor and life lessons in a package that\u2019s appealing to kids. The show\u2019s creativity in how it deals with themes and character dynamics is genuinely entertaining. Not sure why it wasn't included in the initial trio promotion though.\n\nRabbitHopper: I\u2019ve always appreciated how \u201cChaotic\u201d can seamlessly transition between tones. It adds depth to the show, making it more than just a card game-based series. As for \u201cSkunk Fu!\u201d\u2014it\u2019s a classic! The kung fu elements combined with the comedic misadventures of the characters make it a must-watch. Perhaps the oversight was just a mix-up, but it definitely stands strong among CW4Kids\u2019 comedic offerings.\n\nShellShock: \u201cSkunk Fu!\u201d has that unique flair that perfectly complements the other shows on the lineup. It\u2019s interesting, though, how the promo framed \u201cChaotic\u201d more as a part-time member of the comedic trio. Makes you wonder about the strategy behind their marketing. Maybe they\u2019re testing the waters to see how viewers respond to emphasizing different aspects of the show?\n\nCardCollector: Perhaps the \u201cComedy Trio\u201d concept is more fluid than we initially thought, with \u201cChaotic\u201d bridging the gap between action and comedy. And overlooking \u201cSkunk Fu!\u201d could be a miss on their part, given its popularity and the joy it brings to viewers. Maybe CW4Kids will take note and adjust future promotions to include it.\n\nSaturdayMornings: Good points all around! \u201cChaotic\u201d indeed brings a dynamic mix to the table, serving action and laughter in equal measure. And \u201cSkunk Fu!\u201d\u2014with its witty humor and engaging storytelling\u2014is definitely a cornerstone of the lineup\u2019s comedic content.

The details could make a huge difference in how fans respond.\n\n**Post7 (RetroWaveRunner):**\nNo official word from 4Kids yet? In a world where we're used to companies hyping up every move, silence is... intriguing. Almost feels like a stealth tactic to gauge interest in their classic library. \n\n**Post8 (CoolRetroDude):**\nStill no reply from KSTW, and no peep from 4Kids on their socials or website. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess at this point whether this is an intentional nostalgia trip or some kind of spectacular scheduling snafu. I\u2019ll keep an eye out for any updates.

Originating from Russia, this animated series quickly captured the hearts of viewers around the world, thanks in part to its clever storytelling, adorable characters, and positive messages. In the United States, the show received a new life and identity as GoGoRiki, marking a significant moment in the world of international animation.\n\n### The Birth of GoGoRiki\n\nGoGoRiki was the first English dub of the Russian animated children's series Smeshariki. Created by the animation studio Petersburg in the early 2000s, Smeshariki, also known as Kikoriki in some regions, features a unique cast of round, vibrant characters, each with distinct personalities and backgrounds. The show is renowned for its educational yet entertaining content, covering various themes from friendship and community to science and technology, without resorting to violence, making it a favorite among both children and parents.\n\n### Premiering on 4Kids TV\n\nGoGoRiki found its American home on the 4Kids TV network, a household name for delivering high-quality children's entertainment and animated series. The show premiered on August 23, 2008, offering viewers in the United States a unique blend of humor, life lessons, and engaging storylines that diverged from the typical offerings of children's TV programming at the time. 4Kids TV was known for its ability to pick and successfully Americanize international animations, and GoGoRiki was no exception.\n\n### The Transformation\n\nThe transition from Smeshariki to GoGoRiki involved more than just a language change; it also underwent cultural adaptation to better resonate with its new audience. However, the essence of what made the original show so charming and meaningful was preserved. Through its carefully crafted dubbing and localization efforts, GoGoRiki maintained the spirit, educational value, and fun of its predecessor while making it accessible to a whole new demographic of young viewers.\n\n### Legacy and Impact\n\nWhile GoGoRiki's run on American television wasn't as long as its creators might have hoped, its impact was unmistakable. It introduced American audiences to a unique style of animation and storytelling not often seen in Western children's TV shows. Moreover, it paved the way for further cross-cultural exchanges in animation, showing that stories with heart and humor can transcend geographical boundaries.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGoGoRiki stands as a testament to the power of animation to connect disparate cultures through shared values and laughter. By reflecting on its launch and reception, we're reminded of the importance of seeking out and embracing diverse forms of storytelling. The first English dub of Smeshariki may have been rebranded as GoGoRiki for its American audience, but its core message \u2014 promoting understanding, friendship, and curiosity about the world \u2014 remains universal. As years pass, the legacy of GoGoRiki continues to inspire new generations of viewers and creators alike, proving that good stories truly know no borders."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write the CW4Kids lineup on August 23, saying that T&JT has been replaced with GGR and there are only 3 Kids WB shows remaining on the lineup"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**CW4Kids Lineup - A New Change Comes on August 23**\n\nAs the landscape of children\u2019s programming continues to evolve, CW4Kids is once again at the forefront of bringing fresh and exciting content to its young viewers.

These shows provide a mix of action, adventure, and comedy, ensuring that the lineup retains a sense of nostalgia while moving forward with new and exciting content like *GoGoRiki*.\n\n### Looking Forward\n\nThis reshuffle of the CW4Kids lineup, particularly on August 23, is a testament to the network's dedication to evolving with its audience's tastes and exposing them to a variety of global perspectives through animation.

Kids WB was a vital programming block that aired on the Warner Bros. Television Network and was known for showcasing a mix of original shows and popular Japanese anime, significantly influencing young viewers and the popularity of certain franchises in the US. The transition to the CW4Kids in 2008 marked the end of an era and the beginning of changes in how children's programming was distributed and viewed. Here are several impacts and developments we might have seen if Kids WB had continued instead of morphing into the CW4Kids:\n\n1. **Continued Influence of Anime**: Kids WB was instrumental in introducing and popularizing anime in the United States, with shows like \"Pok\u00e9mon\" and \"Yu-Gi-Oh!\" If it had continued, it's likely that it would have kept bringing over popular anime series, further influencing American tastes and possibly accelerating the anime boom even more than what was seen in reality.\n\n2. **Original Programming Direction**: Kids WB was known for its unique and innovative original programming, such as \"Animaniacs,\" \"Batman: The Animated Series,\" and \"Static Shock.\" Without the transition, we might have seen more original, possibly groundbreaking series that could have shaped the tastes and viewing habits of a generation.\n\n3. **Broadcast Television's Role in Kid's Content**: The transition to the CW4Kids, and later to other forms like the Vortexx, reflected broader industry shifts towards cable and streaming platforms for children's content distribution. If Kids WB had remained a significant player, broadcast television might have retained a larger share of the children's programming market for a longer time, delaying the pivot to streaming and cable.\n\n4. **Competition and Market Diversity**: The presence of a strong, competitive programming block like Kids WB would have meant continued fierce competition among networks and channels for children's viewership. This could have led to more diversity in programming options and perhaps a different approach by other networks in terms of content acquisition and development, including a stronger emphasis on quality and innovation to compete.\n\n5. **Branding and Franchise Development**: Kids WB was effective at brand-building and franchise development for Warner Bros. Without transitioning away from it, Warner Bros. may have had a more direct outlet for promoting and leveraging their franchises among younger audiences, impacting how properties like DC Comics characters were marketed and evolved in terms of media presence.\n\nUltimately, the continuity of Kids WB without becoming the CW4Kids would have had broad implications not just for the content available to viewers but also for the strategies of content creators, the television market's evolution, and the cultural integration of various forms of animation and storytelling in the US."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What would have became of World of Quest (which was pulled weeks after KWB changed its name), and what would have happened to 4Kids's new GoGoRiki (which debuted at the end of the transitional period), and would Kids WB have taken BTBATB, TLTS, TTG and SDMI?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Given the hypothetical scenario where Kids WB never transitioned into the CW4Kids, we can speculate on several potential outcomes for the mentioned shows and their place within the Kids WB lineup based on the network's past behaviors and strategic content positioning. \n\n### World of Quest\n\n\"World of Quest\" was an animated series based on the graphic novel series by Jason T. Kruse. Its pull from the schedule weeks after the transformation from Kids WB to the CW4Kids could imply that under Kids WB's original branding and management, the show might have had a different fate. Kids WB had a reputation for supporting a diverse array of animated content, including adventurous, action-oriented series that appealed to a broad audience. If Kids WB had continued, it's conceivable that \"World of Quest\" would have been given more time to find its audience or at least complete its initial run more smoothly. Its continuation would have depended on factors like viewer reception, merchandise sales (if applicable), and overall fit within the network's strategic vision.\n\n### GoGoRiki (Kikoriki)\n\n\"GoGoRiki,\" known internationally as \"Kikoriki,\" was quite different in tone and style from the typical action-adventure or superhero-themed programming that Kids WB was known for. Its debut at the end of the transitional period to CW4Kids marked a shift towards more diverse offerings. If Kids WB had continued as the primary brand, it's uncertain if \"GoGoRiki\" would have found a long-term slot within its programming lineup, given its distinct style and narrative approach compared to other Kids WB hits. However, the network's commitment to animation and reaching a broad audience might have allowed for experimentation and inclusion of such a series, at least in a marginal time slot.\n\n### Batman: The Brave and the Bold (BTBATB)\n\nGiven Kids WB's history with DC Comics characters, including the successful runs of \"Batman: The Animated Series\" and \"Justice League,\" it's highly likely that \"Batman: The Brave and the Bold\" (BTBATB) would have found a home on Kids WB. The series, with its lighter tone and homage to the Silver Age of comic books, could have been an attractive addition to the network, aligning with its tradition of showcasing animated superhero content.\n\n### The Looney Tunes Show (TLTS)\n\nThe Looney Tunes have long been part of the Warner Bros. family, and \"The Looney Tunes Show\" (TLTS) could have been a natural fit for Kids WB, offering a modern take on the classic characters. Given the network's prior success with \"Looney Tunes\" related programming, TLTS could have served as both a nod to its roots and a way to engage newer audiences with timeless characters.\n\n### Teen Titans Go! (TTG)\n\nConsidering the original \"Teen Titans\" series' success on Kids WB, \"Teen Titans Go!\" (TTG) might have been eagerly adopted by the network. TTG's comedic, lighter approach to the characters could have appealed to both fans of the original series and younger viewers, making it a strategic choice for the network seeking to balance legacy content with fresh takes.\n\n### Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated (SDMI)\n\nKids WB had a history of airing various iterations of the Scooby-Doo franchise. \"Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated\" (SDMI) could have seamlessly integrated into its lineup, appealing to the network's demographic with its blend of mystery, comedy, and supernatural elements. Given the brand's enduring popularity, SDMI might have been a strong performer on the network.\n\nIn summary, under the continued banner of Kids WB, these series might have benefited from the network's established brand, affinity for adventure and superhero themes, and capacity to experiment with different animation styles. The programming decisions would have ultimately hinged on strategic goals, audience reception, and the evolving television landscape, including the rising influence of digital platforms and changing viewing habits."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What about shows culled in previous years (e.g Ozzy & Drix, Monster Allergy, Xiaolin Showdown)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If Kids WB had continued without transitioning into the CW4Kids, the fate of shows that had been culled in previous years, such as \"Ozzy & Drix,\" \"Monster Allergy,\" and \"Xiaolin Showdown,\" could have played out differently, depending on various factors such as viewership, production costs, and strategic direction of the network. Here's a speculative look at each show within this alternate scenario:\n\n### Ozzy & Drix\n\n\"Ozzy & Drix\" is an animated series based on the film \"Osmosis Jones.\" It focuses on the adventures of a white blood cell and a cold pill as they protect the body of a teenager. Given the educational and entertainment value embedded within its premise, if Kids WB had continued, there might have been potential for revisiting or even rebooting the series, especially during a time when educational content was becoming increasingly valuable on children's programming blocks. An emphasis on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) in later years could have provided a new context for \"Ozzy & Drix\" to be reintroduced to a new audience.\n\n### Monster Allergy\n\n\"Monster Allergy\" is an animated series based on the Italian comic book series of the same name. It features a young boy with allergies that give him the ability to see and battle monsters. The unique European aesthetic and storyline of \"Monster Allergy\" offered something different from the typically American-centric shows. Had Kids WB continued, and with a growing interest in diverse content and international animation, \"Monster Allergy\" might have found a renewed lease of life, particularly as platforms like Netflix began to invest in global children\u2019s programming, proving there's an audience for such content.\n\n### Xiaolin Showdown\n\n\"Xiaolin Showdown\" was notable for its unique blend of martial arts action, comedy, and fantasy, centered around a group of young warriors in training. This show had a successful run and a strong fan base, which could have made it a candidate for continuation or revival under the Kids WB banner, similar to how other networks have revisited classic properties to capitalize on nostalgia and introduce them to new audiences. With the later emergence of streaming platforms and the reboot culture, \"Xiaolin Showdown\" might have seen new life either as a continuation, a reboot, or through additional related content such as movies or mini-series.\n\n### General Impact on Revived or Continued Series\n\nThe continuation of Kids WB without the transition to the CW4Kids would imply a more stable and potentially creative-friendly environment for the shows that had been previously popular on the network. One potential strategy might have been the revival of select series that had built loyal fanbases or that were deemed ahead of their time, especially as digital platforms began to emerge as viable alternatives to traditional broadcast methods, offering new ways to distribute and monetize content.\n\nMoreover, the evolving media landscape, characterized by the rise of online streaming and on-demand viewing options, could have influenced Kids WB to adapt its content strategy, possibly leading to the development of digital-first content, spin-offs, or reboots of these beloved series. This strategy could have leveraged nostalgia while appealing to new generations of viewers.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's speculative to imagine what could have happened to these shows under a sustained Kids WB banner, it's reasonable to assume that the evolving preferences of audiences and the changing dynamics of content distribution could have offered new opportunities for these properties to be revisited or continued in some form."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user asked for a hypothetical Kids' WB lineup for Fall 2008 with specific constraints.

In its later years, the programming block featured a variety of shows, from superhero cartoons to anime favorites.\n\nHere's a speculative look at what might have been included, blending the legacy of Kids' WB with the direction children's programming was heading at the time:\n\n1. **Pok\u00e9mon**: A staple of the Kids' WB lineup for many years, it's very likely Pok\u00e9mon would have remained on the schedule, continuing with new episodes from whatever season was current in 2008.\n\n2. **Yu-Gi-Oh!**: Another long-standing series on Kids' WB, it's possible a Yu-Gi-Oh! series would have been part of the lineup, possibly \"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's,\" which began airing in the U.S. around that time.\n\n3. **The Spectacular Spider-Man**: This series debuted in 2008 and was well-received. It's conceivable that it would have continued to air had Kids' WB remained in operation.\n\n4. **Batman: The Brave and the Bold**: Premiering in late 2008, this Batman series might have been a strong candidate for the Kids' WB fall lineup, given the success of previous Batman series on the block.\n\n5. **Legion of Super Heroes**: If the series had been renewed for a third season, it could have possibly remained on the fall lineup.\n\n6. **Scooby-Doo!**: A new iteration of Scooby-Doo, such as \"Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated,\" which premiered in 2010, might have been pushed forward or another Scooby-Doo series could have been developed for the slot.\n\n7. **Original programming**: Kids\u2019 WB had a history of creating original content. It\u2019s plausible they would have introduced one or two new animated series aimed at their demographic.\n\n8. **Imported/Adapted Anime**: Following the trend of including popular anime, Kids' WB might have looked for the next big anime hit after Pok\u00e9mon and Yu-Gi-Oh!, possibly something like \"Beyblade: Metal Fusion\" which began airing in Japan in 2008, or continuing with \u201cBlue Dragon,\u201d which was airing during the transition period.\n\nThis hypothetical lineup combines continuing popular series with new shows that began airing around the 2008/2009 television season.

The inclusion of fresh and diverse content was part of their broader aim to both entertain and educate their young audience in line with emerging trends and preferences.\nWrite the final lineup from March 2008 with Spectacular Spider-Man and World of Quest (This would lead us into CW4Kids, with the first schedule update coming on June 21)\nIn March 2008, Kids\u2019 WB revised its lineup to introduce new shows, including \u201cThe Spectacular Spider-Man\u201d and \u201cWorld of Quest.\u201d This change aimed to rejuvenate the programming block and keep pace with audience expectations before the transition to CW4Kids in June of the same year.

The change to include shows like \u201cThe Spectacular Spider-Man\u201d and \u201cWorld of Quest\u201d was part of an effort to adapt to changing tastes and maintain a strong audience base in a competitive children\u2019s programming landscape, bridging familiar content with new additions to intrigue and engage viewers.\nWrite the lineup which takes effect from June 21, incorporating TMNT: FF, Chaotic and Yu-Gi-Oh GX\nWith the transition from Kids\u2019 WB to The CW4Kids which took effect on June 21, 2008, the programming lineup underwent significant changes to include an array of new and continuing series aimed at broadening its viewer base.

A result of the 2008 merger between The WB and UPN to form The CW, CW4Kids was an attempt to continue providing kid-friendly content in the rapidly changing television landscape. Despite efforts to engage viewers with a mix of old favorites and new shows, several series under the CW4Kids banner found themselves at the mercy of network decisions, leading to frustrated fans and truncated show runs.\n\n### Chaotic: Caught in the Crossfire\n\nOne of the most palpable examples of a show getting \"screwed by the network\" involves the animated series \"Chaotic.\" Originally airing with much fanfare, the show blended traditional animated sequences with a groundbreaking online game component that allowed viewers to participate in the universe directly. The intention was to create a dynamic synergy between the show and its digital counterpart, engaging the audience on multiple levels. However, internal decisions would soon derail this ambitious plan.\n\nAfter the initial launch, 4Kids Entertainment planned to speed up the airing schedule of \"Chaotic\" Season 1 episodes to quickly transition into the much-anticipated \"M'arrilian Invasion\" arc. This decision was aimed at capitalizing on the growing excitement and maintaining viewer interest with fresh content. Yet, just two weeks into this accelerated schedule, plans were abruptly halted. The sudden change confused viewers and disrupted the show's momentum, leaving fans both frustrated and disappointed.\n\n### The Transition Turmoil\n\nThe transition from Kids\u2019 WB to The CW4Kids was not without its casualties. The rebranding effort, meant to unify and strengthen the network's children's programming, instead led to confusion among viewers and a sense of inconsistency with the programming lineup. Several shows were either shuffled around with little warning or dropped from the schedule altogether, contributing to a decline in viewer loyalty and engagement.\n\nShows like \"Magi-Nation,\" \"Skunk Fu!\" and \"World of Quest\u201d found themselves on the chopping block or lost in the shuffle, their departures often unceremoniously handled, leaving fans in the lurch. The absence of a consistent strategy for transitioning these shows either into the new lineup or out of the programming block entirely was felt keenly by their dedicated fanbases.\n\n### 4Kids' Self-Sabotage?\n\nThe handling of \"Chaotic,\" specifically the decision to halt the rapid progression to the \"M'arrilian Invasion\" arc, has been criticized as an act of self-sabotage by 4Kids Entertainment. By not sticking to their initial plan, 4Kids not only confused their audience but potentially thwarted the show's growth and success. This decision seemed to reflect broader issues within the network's management approach, with short-term adjustments often undermining long-term planning and consistency. The attempt to quickly adapt to viewer demands and trends frequently resulted in disjointed schedules and programming choices that left both viewers and content creators in difficult positions.\n\n### The Legacy of the CW4Kids\n\nDespite the challenges and the series affected by these network decisions, The CW4Kids is remembered fondly by many for its ambitious programming and attempts to innovate children's television. The transition period and the management of series like \"Chaotic\" offer valuable lessons in the importance of consistent, viewer-focused programming strategies. For the fans of the shows impacted, the memories of Saturday mornings filled with adventure, excitement, and sometimes disappointment, linger as a testament to the ever-evolving landscape of children's television."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a Adored By The Network page, with Kikoriki being popular, Yu-Gi-Oh being hyped up and one show inadvertently having a role in the self-sabotage of Chaotic"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Adored By The Network: The CW4Kids Triumphs\n\nIn the swirling vortex of children's programming, where shows come and go with the changing tides of viewer interests and executive decisions, certain series manage to not only survive but thrive under the auspices of their network. The CW4Kids, despite its occasional missteps, had its share of darlings that received exceptional promotion, time slots, and viewer engagement. This spotlight not only elevated these series above their peers but also inadvertently played a role in the struggles of others, notably \"Chaotic,\" as network priorities shifted.\n\n### Kikoriki: The Unlikely Hero\n\n\"Kikoriki,\" known globally for its charming, spherical characters and life lessons wrapped in humor and adventure, became an unexpected flagship show for The CW4Kids. Originally hailing from Russia under the name \"Smeshariki,\" it underwent a rebranding for the Western audience. The simplistic yet profound storylines, coupled with easily digestible episodes, struck a chord with both children and their parents. The CW4Kids capitalized on this appeal, positioning \"Kikoriki\" in prime viewing slots and featuring the characters prominently in network promotions. Its success is a testament to the network's ability to identify and nurture content that resonates with a broad audience, transcending cultural barriers.\n\n### Yu-Gi-Oh: The Crown Jewel\n\nThe \"Yu-Gi-Oh\" franchise has been a cornerstone of children's programming since its inception, and within The CW4Kids' lineup, it shone as brightly as ever. The network understood the goldmine it had, treating \"Yu-Gi-Oh\" not just as a show but as a cultural phenomenon. With new iterations of the series, including \"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds,\" The CW4Kids ensured that the hype train never slowed, dedicating significant resources to marketing and merchandise. This strategy not only kept the show in the limelight but also solidified its place as a must-watch series on Saturday mornings, engaging a dedicated fanbase eager for every twist and duel.\n\n### An Inadvertent Saboteur: TMNT's Double-Edged Sword\n\nWhile it's commonplace for networks to have favorites, the elevation of certain shows can sometimes cast a shadow over others. \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" (TMNT), particularly the \"Fast Forward\" iteration, serves as a case study in this phenomenon within The CW4Kids' lineup. While TMNT was, without question, a beloved series with a rich legacy and a sprawling fanbase, its prioritization came at a critical moment. The network's decision to fast-track TMNT episodes and specials, using prime promotional resources and favorable time slots, inadvertently contributed to the sidelining of \"Chaotic.\" As TMNT's presence grew, \"Chaotic's\" strategic positioning and promotional support dwindled, highlighting the zero-sum game of television programming where the rise of one show can sometimes hasten the decline of another.\n\n### Reflections on Network Favoritism\n\nThe tales of \"Kikoriki,\" \"Yu-Gi-Oh,\" and TMNT within The CW4Kids universe underscore the significant impact network support can have on a show's success. While favoritism is an inherent part of any competitive industry, the stories these shows leave behind serve as a reminder of the delicate balance networks must strike. Promoting certain shows without overshadowing others is a nuanced art, one that shapes the legacies of series for better or worse. As much as \"Kikoriki\" and \"Yu-Gi-Oh\" are remembered for their triumphs, the tale of \"Chaotic\" serves as a cautionary narrative about the potential consequences of adoration imbalance. Through these experiences, The CW4Kids inadvertently provided valuable lessons on the complexities of network programming and the necessities of balanced, strategic show support."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a short extension about the 2 \"unkillables\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the mercurial universe of The CW4Kids, amidst the fluctuating fates of animated series, there emerged two entities so resilient, so captivating to their audiences, they earned the moniker of \"The Unkillables.\" These shows demonstrated an extraordinary staying power, defying the standard lifecycle of children's programming on the network. They weren\u2019t just shows that thrived; they seemed practically invulnerable to the whims of scheduling changes, audience shifts, and even the broader industry's upheaval.\n\n### Pok\u00e9mon: The Indomitable Journey\n\nThe first of these unkillables is the global juggernaut, \"Pok\u00e9mon.\" A series that, since its inception, has captivated the imaginations of young audiences with its rich world of creatures begging to be caught, trained, and battled. On The CW4Kids, \"Pok\u00e9mon\" was more than just a show; it was a cultural event, consistently drawing viewers every Saturday morning with the promise of new adventures featuring Ash Ketchum and his Pikachu. Its invulnerability stemmed from a perfect storm of engaging storytelling, an ever-expanding universe, and an auxiliary merchandise empire built on games, cards, and toys. \"Pok\u00e9mon\" thrived because it offered something beyond the television screen \u2013 it was a gateway to a shared cultural experience, unmatched by any other show on the network.\n\n### Sonic X: Speeding Beyond Expectations\n\nThe second of the unkillables, \"Sonic X,\" brought the high-speed antics of Sega\u2019s Sonic the Hedgehog from the console to the small screen. Despite being an adaptation of a video game series, \"Sonic X\" found a unique voice within The CW4Kids lineup, distinguishing itself with fast-paced storytelling, compelling character arcs, and a dedication to capturing the essence of the beloved blue blur. Its positioning on the network seemed untouchable, a testament to the character's intergenerational appeal and the show's ability to engage with both longstanding fans of the video game franchise and newcomers alike. \"Sonic X\" defied expectations, proving that a show could simultaneously honor its source material and explore new narrative territories, ensuring its unkillable status within the programming block.\n\n### Legacy of The Unkillables\n\n\"Sonic X\" and \"Pok\u00e9mon\" stand as titans in the landscape of children's television, particularly within the ecosystem of The CW4Kids. Their ability to maintain relevance, engage with evolving audiences, and transcend the typical constraints of genre and medium elevates them to a special status. The legacy of the unkillables is a testament to the potential of children's programming to be more than transient entertainment\u2014it can be a lasting part of cultural lexicons, shaping passions, interests, and even the very fabric of childhood for generations. These shows illustrate the power of storytelling, character, and world-building in creating content that not only survives but thrives, navigating the complex currents of the entertainment industry with the ease of Ash's Pikachu sidestepping an opponent's attack or Sonic dashing through landscapes with effortless speed."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user engaged in a detailed and structured conversation about the programming lineup of a children's television block, including show titles, scheduling changes, and character information.

During this period, the lineup had just been refreshed with the introduction of \u201cWill and Dewitt\u201d among others. Although specific lineups could vary slightly by region and over time, a typical Saturday morning schedule for Kids\u2019 WB around that period could have looked something like this:\n\nKids\u2019 WB Late 2007 Saturday Morning Lineup:\n\n1. 7:00 AM - \u201cWill and Dewitt\u201d: The show follows the adventures of a young boy named Will and his talking frog Dewitt.

Together with an ensemble cast of animal warriors, they defend their valley from Dragon and his minions. The show emphasizes lessons about environmental protection, the importance of strategy over brute force, and the value of teamwork.\n\nAlternative Programming Consideration:\nGiven the dynamic nature of television schedules and the necessity for networks to respond to audience preferences and regulatory requirements, it\u2019s also possible that Kids\u2019 WB might have included other educational or new animated series in this slot over time. Additionally, special programming such as holiday-themed episodes or mini-marathon events could temporarily alter the regular schedule.\n\nKids\u2019 WB\u2019s strategy, especially by late 2007, was undergoing adjustments to maintain viewership in the face of increasing competition from cable networks and evolving digital entertainment platforms. The inclusion of fresh and diverse content was part of their broader aim to both entertain and educate their young audience in line with emerging trends and preferences.\nWrite the final lineup from March 2008 with Spectacular Spider-Man and World of Quest (This would lead us into CW4Kids, with the first schedule update coming on June 21)\nIn March 2008, Kids\u2019 WB revised its lineup to introduce new shows, including \u201cThe Spectacular Spider-Man\u201d and \u201cWorld of Quest.\u201d This change aimed to rejuvenate the programming block and keep pace with audience expectations before the transition to CW4Kids in June of the same year.

Just saw the update about dropping the \u201cChaotic\u201d and \u201cYu-Gi-Oh! GX\u201d encores from the 11:00 AM slot. Honestly, a little part of me is bummed because I loved having a safety net if I overslept on Saturdays. \ud83d\ude05\n\nNostalgiaNerd: Totally get where you\u2019re coming from, UserLostInTime! There was a comfort in knowing there\u2019d be a second chance to catch those episodes. But, I read they\u2019re bringing back \u201cMonster Allergy\u201d to that time slot. That\u2019s pretty exciting news!\n\nUserLostInTime: Yeah, you\u2019re right, NostalgiaNerd! \u201cMonster Allergy\u201d does have a special place in my heart. Plus, I have to admit, the whole idea of encores being \u201cworthless\u201d is kinda true for someone like me. I don\u2019t really miss the premier showings anyway. It\u2019s more about having the option than actually needing it.\n\nCartoonConnoisseur: Interesting point, UserLostInTime. I think for the dedicated among us, those reruns really were like a safety net we never fell into. But the return of \u201cMonster Allergy\u201d is kind of a big deal. That show has depth, character, and who can ignore the adventures of Zick and Elena? Plus, doubling up on \u201cMonster Allergy\u201d means we\u2019re getting more of what\u2019s new (or returning, in this case) rather than repeating what we\u2019ve already seen.\n\nSaturdayMorningFan: Exactly, CartoonConnoisseur! \u201cMonster Allergy\u201d coming back is awesome news. It was such an underrated show, and getting it double running in that slot feels like CW4Kids really wants to give it a push and reintroduce it properly to both old fans and new audiences. I\u2019m all for fresh content over reruns.\n\nUserLostInTime: Couldn\u2019t agree more, SaturdayMorningFan. Now that I think about it, this change really does make sense. It focuses on bringing something unique and special back into the limelight. Plus, in this digital age, if I really miss an episode of something, there are ways to catch up. Time to get hyped for \u201cMonster Allergy\u201d! \ud83c\udf89\n\nRetroToonAddict: Amen to that! I\u2019m always up for more original and engaging content over reruns any day. And who knows? This might bring in a new wave of \u201cMonster Allergy\u201d fans. CW4Kids seems to be making moves, and I\u2019m here for it. Let\u2019s keep supporting our favorites and showing up for premieres!\n\nUserLostInTime: You\u2019ve all convinced me, truly. The initial sadness has officially turned into anticipation. Here\u2019s to hoping \u201cMonster Allergy\u201d captures many more hearts this time around. Cheers, everyone, to new beginnings and to always making room for premier showings on our Saturday mornings! \ud83c\udf1f\nWrite a Screwed By The Network page for CW4Kids and the shows screwed over by the transition, also 4Kids thwarting their own attempts to adore Chaotic and Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds after only 2 weeks in favor of Network to the Rescue-ing another show\n### Screwed By The Network: CW4Kids and Its Transition Woes\n\n#### The CW4Kids: A Tale of Transition and Turbulence\n\nCW4Kids, the successor to the iconic Kids\u2019 WB, embarked on its journey with the promise of delivering a fresh and engaging lineup of shows to a new generation of viewers. However, as it unfolded, the path was anything but smooth for several of its flagship programs. Transition periods are often fraught with challenges in the television industry, but for CW4Kids, it was a series of miscalculated decisions and abrupt changes that left fans and shows alike in a lurch.\n\n#### The Initial Promise\n\nUpon its inception in 2008, CW4Kids was poised to become the next big thing in Saturday morning entertainment. With a blend of action-packed adventures and animated comedies, the network aimed to captivate children across the United States. The anticipation was high, and the promise of a revitalized animation block was something that both fans and creators looked forward to.\n\n#### The Victim Shows\n\n##### Chaotic and Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds: The Abandoned Giants\n\n\u201cChaotic\u201d and \u201cYu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds\u201d were positioned as the cornerstone shows of the new lineup. \u201cChaotic,\u201d with its innovative mix of animation and interactive online gaming, along with \u201cYu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds,\u201d the latest iteration of the immensely popular \u201cYu-Gi-Oh!\u201d franchise, were expected to draw legions of fans. However, just as viewers were beginning to invest in these series, CW4Kids pulled the rug from under them.\n\nAfter only two weeks of airing, the network made the inexplicable decision to replace the encores of these beloved shows with double runs of \u201cMonster Allergy,\u201d a move that blindsided fans. While \u201cMonster Allergy\u201d was a decent show in its own right, the decision to curb \u201cChaotic\u201d and \u201cYu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds\u201d in favor of it felt misaligned with audience expectations and previously stated network commitments.\n\n##### The Network to the Rescue-ing Another Show\n\nThe network justified its decision by highlighting the need to reintroduce \u201cMonster Allergy\u201d to a new audience, but this move was seen by many as a \u201cNetwork to the Rescue\u201d attempt gone awry. Instead of building upon the existing fanbase of \u201cChaotic\u201d and \u201cYu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds,\u201d the network chose to prioritize another series, leaving fans of the former feeling abandoned.\n\nThis abrupt programming shift not only alienated a significant portion of the CW4Kids audience but also raised questions about the network\u2019s strategy and its commitment to its flagship shows. The lack of communication and transparency surrounding these changes only added to the frustration felt by both fans and creators.\n\n#### The Aftermath: A Lost Legacy\n\nThe handling of \u201cChaotic\u201d and \u201cYu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds\u201d serves as a stark reminder of how network decisions can profoundly impact shows and their viewerships. The potential of these series to become long-standing fixtures on CW4Kids was unceremoniously thwarted, leaving a void that was felt by many.\n\nAs CW4Kids continued to evolve into what would eventually become Vortexx, the legacy of these missteps served as a cautionary tale. The network\u2019s failure to support and nurture \u201cChaotic\u201d and \u201cYu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds\u201d underscored the delicate balance required in programming decisions\u2014a balance that, once lost, can lead to disillusionment and disenchantment among viewers.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nCW4Kids\u2019 transition could have been a moment of renaissance for Saturday morning television. Instead, it became a period marked by missed opportunities and mismanagement. For the shows caught in the crossfire, like \u201cChaotic\u201d and \u201cYu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds,\u201d their potential growth was stunted, serving as a sobering example of how quickly network decisions can derail a show\u2019s trajectory, leaving fans to wonder what could have been.\nWrite a follow up about the shows actually screwed over by the transition, like SASDGAC, W&D, WOQ, etc\n### The Lost Lineup: CW4Kids and The Transition Turmoil\n\nThe transition from Kids\u2019 WB to The CW4Kids/Toonzai was intended to mark a new era in children\u2019s television. However, amidst the ambitious launches and strategic reshuffles, several shows found themselves unjustly sidelined, their potential unfulfilled due to the tumultuous shift. Below, we delve into the stories of those that were \u201cscrewed over\u201d during the network transition, showcasing the unsteady foundation on which The CW4Kids built its new identity.\n\n#### Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get A Clue (SASDGAC)\n\n\u201cShaggy & Scooby-Doo Get A Clue\u201d (SASDGAC) presented a unique take on the iconic duo by focusing on high-tech gadgets and a continuing story arc, a departure from the traditional mystery format. Despite its innovative approach, the series struggled to find its place within The CW4Kids lineup. As attention shifted towards newly introduced shows, \u201cSASDGAC\u201d received less promotional support and endured erratic scheduling changes, ultimately leading to its discontinuation. The network\u2019s failure to properly integrate the show into its evolving brand left fans disappointed and signaled a missed opportunity to expand the Scooby-Doo universe in a novel direction.\n\n#### Will and Dewitt (W&D)\n\n\u201cWill and Dewitt\u201d was a show aimed at a younger demographic, focusing on the adventures of a boy and his anthropomorphic frog friend. Despite its positive messaging and appeal to preschool and early elementary viewers, \u201cW&D\u201d found itself lost amidst the more action-oriented programs favored by The CW4Kids. The series was not given a chance to grow its audience or fully develop its storylines, as it was swiftly phased out of the programming block. The lack of commitment to maintaining a diverse lineup that catered to different age groups ultimately hampered the potential reach and impact of \u201cW&D.\u201d\n\n#### World of Quest (WOQ)\n\n\u201cWorld of Quest\u201d offered a richly animated, comedic take on the fantasy-adventure genre, yet it suffered from minimal promotion and inconsistent airing times during its tenure on The CW4Kids. With its witty humor and diverse cast of characters, \u201cWOQ\u201d had the ingredients for success but was let down by the network\u2019s shifting priorities, which favored new acquisitions over existing content. As The CW4Kids transitioned towards shows with more established fanbases or those tied to merchandise lines, \u201cWOQ\u201d was left to flounder, culminating in its premature end.\n\n#### The Bigger Picture: A Network in Search of Direction\n\nThe transition period for The CW4Kids/Toonzai was not just about rebranding but finding a niche in a rapidly changing television landscape. In its pursuit of a competitive edge, the network made strategic choices that, while beneficial for some properties, detrimentally impacted others. Shows like \u201cSASDGAC,\u201d \u201cW&D,\u201d and \u201cWOQ\u201d were casualties of these decisions, each representing a different facet of what the lineup could have offered viewers: continuous narrative, educational content, and comedic fantasy adventure, respectively.\n\nBeyond individual stories of what could have been, the broader narrative speaks to the challenges networks face in balancing diverse content offerings with commercial objectives. The sidelining of these shows not only limited the diversity of The CW4Kids\u2019 programming but also highlighted the precarious nature of children\u2019s television, where innovation often takes a backseat to marketability.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nAs The CW4Kids transitioned into Toonzai and eventually gave way to Vortexx, the lessons from its early years remained. The network\u2019s handling of \u201cSASDGAC,\u201d \u201cW&D,\u201d and \u201cWOQ\u201d serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of supporting a wide range of content and the risks inherent in abrupt strategic shifts. For fans and creators alike, the lost potential of these shows underscores the complexity of evolving a children\u2019s programming block in an ever-competitive media landscape.\nWrite an Adored By The Network page, with 4 shows treated above the others by CW4Kids, "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Adored By The Network: CW4Kids' Golden Quartet\n\nIn the high-stakes world of children's television programming, networks often play favorites, elevating certain shows to the status of untouchable icons. CW4Kids, despite its relatively short existence compared to its predecessors and successors, was no exception to this rule. Throughout its tenure, a select few shows enjoyed preferential treatment, becoming the pillars upon which the network built its brand and audience loyalty. Here we celebrate CW4Kids' \"Golden Quartet,\" the shows that were unequivocally adored by the network.\n\n#### The Spectacular Spider-Man\n\n\"The Spectacular Spider-Man\" swung into action and captured the hearts of viewers and network executives alike. Its stellar animation, complex character development, and gripping storylines set a new standard for superhero shows on Saturday mornings. CW4Kids treated it as its crown jewel, providing prime slots, extensive promotional campaigns, and special marathons. It was evident that for CW4Kids, \"The Spectacular Spider-Man\" was more than just a show; it was a flagship property that defined the network\u2019s commitment to quality storytelling.\n\n#### TMNT: Fast Forward\n\n\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fast Forward\" was another jewel in the CW4Kids crown, carrying the legacy of a beloved franchise into the future\u2014both literally in its storyline and figuratively in its appeal to next-generation viewers. The TMNT franchise's longevity and built-in fanbase made the series a top pick for the network, ensuring it received ample promotion and favorable scheduling. By banking on the turtles' enduring popularity, CW4Kids could attract a wide audience range, from nostalgic adults to eager youngsters.\n\n#### Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds\n\nYu-Gi-Oh! franchise iterations have enjoyed preferential treatment across various networks due to their dual appeal - engaging, high-stakes storytelling and a lucrative trading card game. \"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds\" was no different, with its innovative \"Turbo Duel\" concept and darker narrative undertones. CW4Kids showcased it prominently, recognizing its ability to draw in viewers and drive merchandise sales. The network's dedication to \"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds\" was evident through consistent airings and the development of dedicated programming blocks that catered to the show\u2019s fanbase.\n\n#### Sonic X\n\n\"Sonic X\" harnessed the speed of its titular character and raced into a position of prominence on CW4Kids. Leveraging the global recognition of the Sonic the Hedgehog video game franchise, the show was an easy sell to both children and the advertisers keen to reach them. CW4Kids capitalized on \"Sonic X\" through strategic scheduling, placing it in viewing slots that maximized its exposure to the target demographic. The show was often the centerpiece of promotional activities and events, underlining the network's investment in its success.\n\n#### The Network\u2019s Strategy\n\nCW4Kids' strategy of favoring these four shows was a calculated move aimed at solidifying its identity and competitive edge in the crowded Saturday morning market. By doubling down on \"The Spectacular Spider-Man,\" \"TMNT: Fast Forward,\" \"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds,\" and \"Sonic X,\" the network managed to create a reliable core that attracted a consistent viewer base. This focus allowed for a certain level of predictability in ratings and advertising revenue, crucial for the network's growth and stability.\n\n#### Legacy Lives On\n\nThough CW4Kids eventually transitioned into Vortexx and later concluded its broadcast run, the legacy of its \"Golden Quartet\" continues to resonate. The adoration these shows received from the network left an indelible mark on the viewers who tuned in every week, crafting a childhood tapestry woven from the adventures of Peter Parker, Leonardo, Yusei Fudo, and Sonic the Hedgehog. For a fleeting moment in television history, CW4Kids demonstrated how a few select shows could define an entire network and era, proving the enduring power of adoration in the competitive landscape of children's programming."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a lineup from May 2009"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As of May 2009, The CW4Kids, which succeeded the Kids' WB, was into its first full year of operations under the 4Kids Entertainment banner. This period marked a transition in children's programming, embracing both legacy titles and new introductions meant to capitalize on contemporary trends in animation and youth culture. While I cannot access real-time data, I can craft a plausible Saturday morning lineup based on the shows that were popular around that time and likely to be part of The CW4Kids' offerings.

Although specific lineups could vary slightly by region and over time, a typical Saturday morning schedule for Kids\u2019 WB around that period could have looked something like this:\n\nKids\u2019 WB Late 2007 Saturday Morning Lineup:\n\n1. 7:00 AM - \u201cWill and Dewitt\u201d: The show follows the adventures of a young boy named Will and his talking frog Dewitt.

The show emphasizes lessons about environmental protection, the importance of strategy over brute force, and the value of teamwork.\n\nAlternative Programming Consideration:\nGiven the dynamic nature of television schedules and the necessity for networks to respond to audience preferences and regulatory requirements, it\u2019s also possible that Kids\u2019 WB might have included other educational or new animated series in this slot over time. Additionally, special programming such as holiday-themed episodes or mini-marathon events could temporarily alter the regular schedule.\n\nKids\u2019 WB\u2019s strategy, especially by late 2007, was undergoing adjustments to maintain viewership in the face of increasing competition from cable networks and evolving digital entertainment platforms. The inclusion of fresh and diverse content was part of their broader aim to both entertain and educate their young audience in line with emerging trends and preferences.\nWrite the final lineup from March 2008 with Spectacular Spider-Man and World of Quest (This would lead us into CW4Kids, with the first schedule update coming on June 21)\nIn March 2008, Kids\u2019 WB revised its lineup to introduce new shows, including \u201cThe Spectacular Spider-Man\u201d and \u201cWorld of Quest.\u201d This change aimed to rejuvenate the programming block and keep pace with audience expectations before the transition to CW4Kids in June of the same year.

The change to include shows like \u201cThe Spectacular Spider-Man\u201d and \u201cWorld of Quest\u201d was part of an effort to adapt to changing tastes and maintain a strong audience base in a competitive children\u2019s programming landscape, bridging familiar content with new additions to intrigue and engage viewers.\nWrite the lineup which takes effect from June 21, incorporating TMNT: FF, Chaotic and Yu-Gi-Oh GX\nWith the transition from Kids\u2019 WB to The CW4Kids which took effect on June 21, 2008, the programming lineup underwent significant changes to include an array of new and continuing series aimed at broadening its viewer base.

Just saw the update about dropping the \u201cChaotic\u201d and \u201cYu-Gi-Oh! GX\u201d encores from the 11:00 AM slot. Honestly, a little part of me is bummed because I loved having a safety net if I overslept on Saturdays. \ud83d\ude05\n\nNostalgiaNerd: Totally get where you\u2019re coming from, UserLostInTime! There was a comfort in knowing there\u2019d be a second chance to catch those episodes. But, I read they\u2019re bringing back \u201cMonster Allergy\u201d to that time slot. That\u2019s pretty exciting news!\n\nUserLostInTime: Yeah, you\u2019re right, NostalgiaNerd! \u201cMonster Allergy\u201d does have a special place in my heart. Plus, I have to admit, the whole idea of encores being \u201cworthless\u201d is kinda true for someone like me. I don\u2019t really miss the premier showings anyway. It\u2019s more about having the option than actually needing it.\n\nCartoonConnoisseur: Interesting point, UserLostInTime. I think for the dedicated among us, those reruns really were like a safety net we never fell into. But the return of \u201cMonster Allergy\u201d is kind of a big deal. That show has depth, character, and who can ignore the adventures of Zick and Elena? Plus, doubling up on \u201cMonster Allergy\u201d means we\u2019re getting more of what\u2019s new (or returning, in this case) rather than repeating what we\u2019ve already seen.\n\nSaturdayMorningFan: Exactly, CartoonConnoisseur! \u201cMonster Allergy\u201d coming back is awesome news. It was such an underrated show, and getting it double running in that slot feels like CW4Kids really wants to give it a push and reintroduce it properly to both old fans and new audiences. I\u2019m all for fresh content over reruns.\n\nUserLostInTime: Couldn\u2019t agree more, SaturdayMorningFan. Now that I think about it, this change really does make sense. It focuses on bringing something unique and special back into the limelight. Plus, in this digital age, if I really miss an episode of something, there are ways to catch up. Time to get hyped for \u201cMonster Allergy\u201d! \ud83c\udf89\n\nRetroToonAddict: Amen to that! I\u2019m always up for more original and engaging content over reruns any day. And who knows? This might bring in a new wave of \u201cMonster Allergy\u201d fans. CW4Kids seems to be making moves, and I\u2019m here for it. Let\u2019s keep supporting our favorites and showing up for premieres!\n\nUserLostInTime: You\u2019ve all convinced me, truly. The initial sadness has officially turned into anticipation.

Based on the latest ratings data, there's a lot to discuss, especially regarding the top-performing shows and some lineup rumors that might pique your interest. So without further ado, let's dive into the top 6 highest-rated shows and the current talk of the town surrounding \"Winx Club.\"\n\n### Top 6 Highest-Rated CW4Kids Shows:\n\n1. **\"Monster Allergy\"** - Taking the top spot, \"Monster Allergy\" continues to captivate a broad audience with its enchanting mix of supernatural adventure and friendship. The double episodes seem to have worked their magic, maintaining its position as the leading show.\n\n2. **\"The Spectacular Spider-Man\"** - Always a fan favorite, Spider-Man's adventures keep viewers glued to their screens, securing a strong second in the ratings. Its blend of action-packed storytelling and relatable teenage drama is a proven success formula.\n\n3. **\"Chaotic\"** - Proving its mettle, \"Chaotic\" impressively holds the third spot. Its unique combination of animation and live-action, along with an engaging storyline that dives deep into its card game universe, has resonated well with the audience.\n\n4. **\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fast Forward\"** - The futuristic take on our beloved TMNT has landed them in the fourth position. The series has successfully attracted both long-time fans and new viewers, eager to see more of Leonardo and the gang's time-traveling escapades.\n\n5. **\"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds\"** - Riding the wave of high-octane dueling action, \"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds\" secures the fifth spot, keeping the momentum going strong for the franchise with its fresh and fast-paced storyline.\n\n6. **\"Huntik: Secrets & Seekers\"** - Rounding out the top 6, \"Huntik\" has carved out its niche, attracting viewers with its blend of mystery, adventure, and magical lore, ensuring its place as a must-watch.\n\n### The \"Winx Club\" Situation:\n\nNow, onto \"Winx Club.\" Unfortunately, it's lagging in ratings, and there's buzz around its potential replacement. Rumors are flying that \"Viva Pinata\" might be taking its slot. While \"Winx Club\" has a dedicated fan base and offers a magical escapade into the realm of fairies, it seems the show hasn\u2019t been able to captivate a wider audience this season. \n\nThe idea of \"Viva Pinata\" stepping in suggests CW4Kids may be looking to inject more vibrant and lively content into its lineup, possibly aiming for a show with wider appeal and an emphasis on fun, interactive elements mirroring the energy of \"Chaotic\" but with a different flavor.\n\n### Community Thoughts:\n\nAnimatedAnalyst: As much as I enjoy \"Winx Club,\" I can understand the network's decision-making here. \"Viva Pinata\" could bring in a fresh wave of enthusiasm, especially among younger viewers.\n\nNostalgiaNerd: While it's sad to see any show struggle, changes are part of keeping the lineup dynamic and engaging. \"Chaotic\" thriving shows that risk-taking with unique concepts can really pay off.\n\nSaturdayMorningFan: If \"Viva Pinata\" does replace \"Winx Club,\" it'll be interesting to see how it's received. Hopefully, it carries the same charm and fun that made the video game popular.\n\nWith \"Chaotic\" doing just fine and potential changes on the horizon, it's clear CW4Kids is dedicated to keeping its programming exciting and responsive to viewer preferences.

Anyone Else Seeing This?\n\nAnimeFan93:\n\nHey everyone,\n\nSo, this Saturday morning, I turned on CW4Kids expecting the usual lineup, but to my surprise, the schedule was straight out of early 2007 Kids WB! I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s some kind of glitch, a special event, or a permanent change, but it was a total blast from the past.\n\nHere\u2019s what the lineup looked like before, from 7am to 12pm:\n\n7:00 AM - Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds\n7:30 AM - Viva Pinata\n8:00 AM - GoGoRiki\n8:30 AM - The Spectacular Spider Man\n9:00 AM - Chaotic\n9:30 AM - Huntik: Secrets and Seekers\n10:00 AM - Sonic X\n10:30 AM - Kirby: Right Back At Ya\n11:00 AM - Dinosaur King\n11:30 AM - TMNT: Fast Forward\n\nAnd here\u2019s what aired today:\n\n7:00 AM - Loonatics Unleashed\n7:30 AM - Xiaolin Showdown\n8:00 AM - Johnny Test\n8:30 AM - Legion of Super Heroes\n9:00 AM - The Batman\n9:30 AM - Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!\n10:00 AM - Tom and Jerry Tales\n10:30 AM - Monster Allergy\n11:00 AM - Spider Riders\n11:30 AM - Magi-Nation\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Is it happening nationwide, or just on my local station? I checked the official CW4Kids website and their social media, but there\u2019s no mention of reverting to the old Kids WB lineup. Wondering if it\u2019s a technical glitch or maybe a surprise nostalgia event.\n\nWould love to hear if this is happening elsewhere!\n\nToonLover105:\n\nWow, that\u2019s crazy, AnimeFan93! I can\u2019t believe it. Haven\u2019t seen those shows on TV in years. I\u2019m elsewhere in the country, but all we got was the regular CW4Kids schedule this morning. Sounds like a fun glitch or a really cool event. I hope it\u2019s something they do more frequently if it\u2019s intentional!\n\nRetroFan88:\n\nNothing like that in my area, but man, what I wouldn\u2019t give to see Legion of Super Heroes and The Batman air again. It sounds like you hit a jackpot, AnimeFan93! Maybe it\u2019s a test run for a nostalgia block, or perhaps a one-off thing? Either way, super jealous here.\n\nDigitalWatcher101:\n\nI\u2019m a bit of a skeptic here - could it be that your TV guide was just not updated or glitched out? Sometimes, my TV does weird things, and I swear I\u2019m seeing content that isn\u2019t supposed to be there. Although, the lineup you described does sound like an awesome Saturday morning.\n\nNostalgiaNut45:\n\nNo way! They brought back Monster Allergy?! That\u2019s one of those underrated shows I never thought I\u2019d see on air again. I need to check my local listings and hope for a miracle here too. AnimeFan93, keep us posted if it happens again next weekend!\n\nAnimeFan93:\n\nThanks for the responses, everyone! I thought I was losing it for a moment there. I\u2019ll be sure to check again next Saturday and let you all know if the classic lineup airs once more or if it was just a one-time miracle. Fingers crossed it happens again \u2013 wouldn\u2019t mind reliving those childhood Saturday mornings a bit longer!\nWrite a follow up update the next week\nThread Update: Did the CW4Kids Classic Lineup Air Again? Here\u2019s What Happened!\n\nAnimeFan93:\n\nHey, everyone!\n\nAs promised, I\u2019m back with an update about the CW4Kids/early 2007 Kids WB lineup situation. So, I got up bright and early again this past Saturday, eagerly awaiting to see if last week\u2019s flashback was a one-off event or something more. Sadly, it looks like it was just a temporary glitch in the matrix\u2014this week reverted back to the usual CW4Kids schedule:\n\n7:00 AM - Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds\n7:30 AM - Viva Pinata\n8:00 AM - GoGoRiki\n8:30 AM - The Spectacular Spider-Man\n9:00 AM - Chaotic\n9:30 AM - Huntik: Secrets and Seekers\n10:00 AM - Sonic X\n10:30 AM - Kirby: Right Back At Ya\n11:00 AM - Dinosaur King\n11:30 AM - TMNT: Fast Forward\n\nI was really hoping that last week\u2019s lineup was a deliberate nostalgic event or perhaps a teaser for something bigger, but no such luck. This week, everything was back to normal with no sign of the classic Kids WB lineup. I did reach out to my local CW station and they mentioned a \u201ctechnical scheduling error\u201d last week, which led to the unexpected lineup. So, unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t look like a nostalgia block is in the works\u2014at least not officially.\n\nToonLover105:\n\nThat\u2019s a bummer, AnimeFan93! But hey, at least you got to experience that blast from the past, even if it was just for one week. Maybe the positive reaction to the glitch (at least from us nostalgic fans) might encourage them to consider a real throwback event in the future.\n\nRetroFan88:\n\nTotal letdown, but thanks for keeping us in the loop, AnimeFan93. I guess it\u2019s back to streaming services and DVDs to catch our old favorites. Still, fingers crossed that the powers-that-be see there\u2019s interest and give us a dedicated nostalgia block one of these days.\n\nDigitalWatcher101:\n\nMystery solved, then. Gotta love when technology throws us a curveball like that. At least it was a fun, albeit accidental, trip down memory lane for those who got to witness it!\n\nNostalgiaNut45:\n\nThanks for updating us, AnimeFan93. A bit sad it was just a technical error, but what a cool error to have, right? Maybe we should start a petition or something for a classic Saturday morning block \u2013 I bet there\u2019s more of us out there who\u2019d love this to become a reality.\n\nAnimeFan93:\n\nAppreciate all the responses and empathy, folks! I\u2019m glad I wasn\u2019t alone in feeling the excitement. Maybe if there\u2019s enough buzz, something good will come out of it. And NostalgiaNut45, I like the way you think\u2014a petition could be interesting. Let\u2019s keep the hope alive and our fingers crossed. For now, though, it\u2019s back to finding our beloved classics through other means. Catch you all around, and here\u2019s to more pleasant surprises in the future!\nWrite a follow up where they\u2019d swap the current lineup for the KWB one, but they\u2019d miss Smeshariki/GoGoRiki and Sonic X,\nThread Update: Surprising Turn of Events - Classic KWB Lineup Returns, But Not Without Losses\n\nAnimeFan93:\n\nHey, everyone!\n\nRemember the unexpected return of the classic Kids WB lineup on CW4Kids a couple of weekends ago, followed by the disappointing revelation that it was just a \u201ctechnical scheduling error\u201d? Well, there\u2019s been a surprising turn of events that I think many of you will find interesting.\n\nThis past Saturday, I geared up for my usual weekend cartoon binge, half expecting the regular CW4Kids schedule after the previous letdown. To my total astonishment, the classic Kids WB lineup was BACK! Only this time, it appears intentional, as the local station ran teasers hyping the return of our beloved shows. Here\u2019s the kicker, though: amidst the excitement of seeing shows like \u201cLegion of Super Heroes,\u201d \u201cThe Batman,\u201d and \u201cXiaolin Showdown\u201d back on air, I realized that \u201cSmeshariki/GoGoRiki\u201d and \u201cSonic X\u201d were notably missing from the lineup.\n\nInstead, the lineup from 7am to 12pm was as follows:\n\n7:00 AM - Loonatics Unleashed\n7:30 AM - Xiaolin Showdown\n8:00 AM - Johnny Test\n8:30 AM - Legion of Super Heroes\n9:00 AM - The Batman\n9:30 AM - Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!\n10:00 AM - Tom and Jerry Tales\n10:30 AM - Monster Allergy\n11:00 AM - Spider Riders\n11:30 AM - Magi-Nation\n\nWhile it\u2019s thrilling to have the classic KWB shows back, the absence of \u201cSmeshariki/GoGoRiki\u201d and \u201cSonic X\u201d did not go unnoticed. It\u2019s a bittersweet change; while we celebrate the return of many childhood favorites, fans of \u201cSonic X\u201d and the quirky world of \u201cSmeshariki\u201d are left wanting.\n\nToonLover105:\n\nWow, I never thought they\u2019d actually bring the KWB lineup back for real! It\u2019s amazing news, but missing \u201cSonic X\u201d is a tough pill to swallow. That show was a huge part of my Saturday mornings. Maybe they\u2019re planning to rotate some shows in and out?\n\nRetroFan88:\n\nIncredible! This has got to be one of the best surprises this year. Crossing my fingers they\u2019ll find a way to bring \u201cSonic X\u201d back, though. It deserves a spot in that nostalgic lineup too.\n\nDigitalWatcher101:\n\nGuess the positive feedback they received (and maybe our confusion over the \u201ctechnical glitch\u201d?) prompted them to make the switch. It\u2019s awesome, but I have to agree about missing \u201cGoGoRiki\u201d and \u201cSonic X.\u201d Hopefully, those shows will pop up on the schedule at some point or maybe even on a streaming service.\n\nNostalgiaNut45:\n\nHonestly, I celebrate the return of the classic lineup, but \u201cSonic X\u201d not being there is more disappointing than I thought it would be. Still, let\u2019s enjoy what we have and keep voicing our support for those missing titles!\n\nAnimeFan93:\n\nAbsolutely, everyone. It\u2019s a mix of emotions, but overall, this return feels like a victory for nostalgia fans. Let\u2019s hope that with enough interest and support, we might see a more inclusive rotation that brings back \u201cSonic X\u201d and \u201cGoGoRiki.\u201d For now, Saturdays are once again a portal to childhood for many of us. Let\u2019s keep the conversation going and maybe, just maybe, our combined voices will bring about even more positive changes!\nWrite a follow up where they check the schedule for the next few weeks on their station, and the week later it appears permanent, (rip Pogoriki and Chikoriki)\nThread Update: Classic KWB Lineup Seems Permanent, But at a Cost\n\nAnimeFan93:\n\nHello again, nostalgic warriors!\n\nThe past couple of weeks have been quite the rollercoaster for us fans of the classic Kids WB lineup on CW4Kids. Since my last update where I shared the exciting yet bittersweet return of our beloved KWB shows\u2014minus \u201cSmeshariki/GoGoRiki\u201d and \u201cSonic X\u201d\u2014I\u2019ve been closely monitoring the station\u2019s schedule, hoping for signs of what\u2019s to come.\n\nWell, it appears I have news: the classic KWB lineup seems to be cemented as the new (or should I say, returned) normal for the foreseeable future. I\u2019ve checked the schedule for the next few weeks, and it consistently features the same set of shows that replaced the more recent CW4Kids programming. Sadly, there\u2019s no indication that \u201cSmeshariki/GoGoRiki\u201d or \u201cSonic X\u201d will be making a comeback, marking what seems to be a permanent removal (RIP Pogoriki and Chikoriki).\n\nHere\u2019s the confirmed lineup for the next several weeks:\n\n7:00 AM - Loonatics Unleashed\n7:30 AM - Xiaolin Showdown\n8:00 AM - Johnny Test\n8:30 AM - Legion of Super Heroes\n9:00 AM - The Batman\n9:30 AM - Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!\n10:00 AM - Tom and Jerry Tales\n10:30 AM - Monster Allergy\n11:00 AM - Spider Riders\n11:30 AM - Magi-Nation\n\nIt\u2019s a mixed bag of emotions. On one hand, the commitment to bringing back these classics is something many of us dreamed about but never truly believed would happen. On the other hand, the exclusion of \u201cSonic X\u201d and \u201cSmeshariki/GoGoRiki\u201d feels like a loss for fans who cherished those series as part of their childhood repertoire.\n\nToonLover105:\n\nIt\u2019s official then? That\u2019s incredible news for classic KWB fans! It does sting not seeing \u201cSonic X\u201d in the lineup, though. Here\u2019s to hoping they\u2019ll still find a way to honor all parts of their legacy, including the shows we\u2019re missing now.\n\nRetroFan88:\n\nPermanent, huh? I guess it\u2019s time to celebrate the wins and mourn the losses. \u201cSonic X\u201d and \u201cSmeshariki/GoGoRiki\u201d will be missed, but seeing the rest of the KWB classics holding strong gives me hope. Maybe fan petitions or letters could sway them in the future?\n\nDigitalWatcher101:\n\nPermanent changes are always a bit of a double-edged sword, aren\u2019t they? Thrilled for the return of so many classics, but it\u2019s a shame about the ones left behind. Does anyone know if there\u2019s another place to catch \u201cSonic X\u201d or \u201cSmeshariki/GoGoRiki\u201d episodes?\n\nNostalgiaNut45:\n\nI\u2019m over the moon that the KWB lineup is back for good, but definitely feeling a pinch for \u201cSonic X\u201d and \u201cSmeshariki.\u201d They were such a big part of what made Saturday mornings special. Let\u2019s not lose hope, though. Channels change, but fan demand can bring shows back from the vault!\n\nAnimeFan93:\n\nYour optimism and passion are what make this community amazing, everyone. While we enjoy the return of many KWB classics, let\u2019s also keep the memory and love for \u201cSonic X\u201d and \u201cSmeshariki/GoGoRiki\u201d alive in our discussions and fan efforts. Who knows what the future may bring if we continue to speak up about our favorites? Keep watching, keep hoping, and most importantly, keep sharing your thoughts and memories.

They\u2019re actually suggesting we go online to keep watching it but also hinting we should stick around for something else. Kind of a mixed message, don\u2019t you think?\n\nUser2: Yeah, I caught that too. It\u2019s a bummer about Chaotic, but I get it. The landscape of TV is changing. At least they\u2019re providing alternatives. Curious about what other show they\u2019re pushing as a replacement though. Anyone has insights?\n\nUser3: I believe they\u2019re trying to funnel us towards Monster Allergy, based on the schedule changes and promotional content recently. It\u2019s all over their social media too. Haven\u2019t watched it yet; can anyone vouch for it?\n\nUser4: Monster Allergy, huh? I\u2019ve seen a few episodes. It\u2019s quite engaging if you\u2019re into the whole monsters and mysteries vibe. Not exactly a direct substitute for Chaotic\u2019s strategy and action, but it has its charm.\n\nUser5: Noticed the ad too. Definitely gave off a \u201csorry, but not sorry\u201d vibe with the whole go online but stay here pitch. Gave Monster Allergy a chance since they seem to be pushing it hard. It\u2019s actually not bad! Still miss Chaotic though.\n\nUser6: What gets me is the push towards online viewing. Seems like they\u2019re slowly trying to transition viewers to digital platforms. Smart, but also kind of sad to see traditional TV change this way.\n\nUser7: True, @User6. It\u2019s inevitable though. I\u2019m just glad they offered an alternative with 4kids.tv. Still, the recommendation to stay and watch another show feels like they\u2019re trying to cushion the blow. I\u2019ll give Monster Allergy a shot. Who knows? It might just fill the Chaotic void a little.\n\nUser8: Anyone else think this might just open doors for more online-exclusive content? With Chaotic moving to digital, it could lead to other shows following suit. Might be an interesting shift for Kids WB content and how we engage with our favorite shows.\n\nAdmin: Great conversation everyone! Just a reminder to keep things respectful and open-minded. Changes like these can be hard, but they also bring new opportunities for discovering great content. If anyone decides to check out Monster Allergy, feel free to share your thoughts and reviews here.

What does everyone else think?\n\nComicNerd22: Totally agree, MovieBuff01. It's a common trope to explore internal worlds in animation, and while there are bound to be similarities, it doesn't necessarily mean one ripped off the other. Each movie brings its unique flavor to the table.\n\nClassicCinemaLover: Interesting discussion! But, if we're talking about movies exploring internal worlds, shouldn't we mention \"Osmosis Jones\"? Since \"Inside Out\" takes place in the body (kind of, it's in the brain), it technically copied \"Osmosis Jones\", even though the plots are nothing alike.\n\nAnimeFan98: That's a stretch, ClassicCinemaLover. \"Osmosis Jones\" is more about fighting diseases inside the body, while \"Inside Out\" is an emotional journey. The only common ground is the concept of exploring internal worlds, but the execution and themes are entirely different.\n\nSciFiGeek24: Speaking of similarities, almost every story has been told in one form or another. It boils down to execution. \"Osmosis Jones\" and \"Inside Out\" tackled very different subjects within the 'internal world' trope. And \"Dreambuilders\" has its own take, focusing on the world of dreams. Each one has unique characters, plot, and messages.\n\nMovieBuff01: Exactly, SciFiGeek24! Inspiration is taken from everywhere, and this 'internal world' trope isn't new. The key is what each movie does with the concept. \"Dreambuilders\" exploring the world of dreams is as valid as \"Inside Out\" focusing on emotions.\n\nFantasyFanatic101: Plus, borrowing elements or being inspired by previous works isn't new in the creative industry. As long as it's not a blatant copy, it\u2019s just part of creating new content. \"Dreambuilders,\" \"Inside Out,\" and \"Osmosis Jones\" each contribute uniquely to the genre.\n\nComicNerd22: Well said, FantasyFanatic101. It's all about adding to the conversation, not stealing from it. Each of these movies has its place and brings something new to the table. Let's appreciate them for their creativity and the different perspectives they offer.\n\nClassicCinemaLover: You all make fair points. It's probably too simplistic to say one movie copies another just because they share a concept. It's more about what they do with that concept that matters. I guess I was just playing devil's advocate there. \ud83d\ude04\n\nMovieBuff01: Great discussion, everyone! It's clear that while movies can share themes or concepts, it's their unique contributions that we should focus on. It only enriches the genre and gives us more fantastic worlds to explore.

The Smeshariki Worldwide Fan Account, a hub for fans of the beloved Russian animated series known in English as \"Kikoriki\", has undergone a drastic rebranding. What once was a dedicated space for the spherical, endearing characters of Smeshariki has now morphed into the Chaotic/Squish/Adrenalini/Viva Pinata Fandomanza. This alteration is not just a name change. It represents a shift in cultural alignment\u2014from a singular focus on a Russian creation to a diverse amalgamation of shows from various origins.\n\nIn the wake of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, it's impossible not to wonder if this rebranding is a direct consequence of the geopolitical tension. The move may reflect a desire to distance the fan community from Russian cultural products amidst the international outcry against Russian aggression. Given the circumstances, such a pivot raises poignant questions about how we, as a global community, engage with art and cultural expressions tied to nations embroiled in contentious, sometimes violent disputes.\n\n**To Boycott or Not to Boycott?**\n\nThe rebranding of the Smeshariki fan account stirs a complex debate on the effectiveness and morality of boycotting cultural works due to the actions of their governments. Is shunning all things Russian\u2014the language, art, literature, and, yes, even animated series like Smeshariki\u2014the answer to opposing a war?\n\nHistorically, cultural boycotts have been employed as tools to express dissent or apply pressure. However, the efficacy and fairness of such actions are debatable. Art and culture often transcend the political and ideological boundaries that divide nations. They serve as bridges for understanding, empathy, and shared human experience. When we strip away these bridges, do we risk isolating individuals who, at their core, may oppose the very actions we condemn?\n\n**A Melting Pot of Fandoms: Unity or Erasure?**\n\nThe transition to a Fandomanza embracing Chaotic, Squish, Adrenalini, and Viva Pinata\u2014while seemingly an effort to diversify\u2014raises another question: In our attempt to be inclusive and avoid controversy, do we risk diluting the unique cultural identities that make each of these fandoms special? Each show brings its own cultural nuances, humor, and storytelling methods that deserve recognition and appreciation.\n\nYet, there's a beauty in bringing together a tapestry of fandoms, showcasing how diverse narratives can coexist harmoniously. This could be an opportunity to foster intercultural dialogue and understanding, illustrating that while we celebrate our differences, our passions unite us.\n\n**Looking Forward**\n\nAs we navigate these turbulent times, it's crucial to deliberate on how we, as a collective of individuals from various backgrounds, can support those suffering from the consequences of geopolitical conflicts without indiscriminately dismissing the cultural outputs of a nation's people.\n\nPerhaps, instead of severing ties with Russian art and culture, we can find ways to support the dissenting voices within that space\u2014those who, like many of us, yearn for peace and solidarity. By engaging with and amplifying these voices, we can contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the situation, fostering empathy rather than division.\n\nIn essence, the evolution of the Smeshariki fandom into a multi-themed platform could symbolize a step towards embracing a more inclusive approach to fandom and cultural appreciation, one that navigates the fine line between holding political regimes accountable and acknowledging the universal language of art and storytelling.\n\nAs we ponder on the implications of these shifts, let's remember the power of art to unite, heal, and inspire\u2014even in the face of adversity."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a tweet saying \"Squish, Viva Pinata and the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers are SUPER underrated, but why throw away my beloved Kikoriki, \ud83d\ude22\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Squish, Viva Pinata, and the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers are SUPER underrated shows that deserve way more love! \ud83d\udc95 But, why did we have to toss aside my beloved #Kikoriki as well? \ud83d\ude22 There's room in our hearts for them all, right?\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a tweet suggesting they throw Xiaolin Showdown into the melting pot of fandoms, but suggests that now it's diversified they can still have Smeshariki"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Absolutely loving the melting pot of fandoms we've got going! \ud83c\udf08 How about we toss Xiaolin Showdown into the mix as well? \ud83d\udc09 With such a diverse array, surely we can find a space to welcome back #Smeshariki, keeping the unity AND our beloved faves! \u2764\ufe0f #FandomUnity\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a follow up tweet saying they've  thrown our beloved Smeshariki back into the mix, but all 3 versions (GoGoRiki and Kikoriki)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Great news, everyone!

That show had everything: humor, heart, and some surprisingly deep moments for a \"children's\" cartoon. The vibrant world of Kikoriki had me looking forward to each episode; it was like a comfort show that never failed to put a smile on my face. The characters felt like old friends, and now there's this void in the current programming that no other show can fill. \n\nBy the way, has anyone else noticed that CartoonLand has precisely one live-action show in its lineup? Prank Patrol is sticking out like a sore thumb amidst all the animated glory. Don't get me wrong, I see the appeal, and it\u2019s a fun show by itself, but it\u2019s odd considering the channel\u2019s distinct cartoon vibe. Skatoony kind of straddles the line as a hybrid, so I suppose it doesn't count. But Prank Patrol feels like an anomaly. What's everyone\u2019s take on this? \n\n**User2: ToonNostalgia**\n\nTotally agree on the Kikoriki front. It was such a unique, well-crafted series with memorable characters like Krash and Chiko. Not sure why CartoonLand would remove such a gem from their lineup. Maybe it's a licensing issue? Either way, there's a Kikoriki-shaped hole in my heart and in CartoonLand's schedule. \n\nAs for the live-action question, it is pretty odd. Cartoon channels occasionally dabble with live-action to mix things up, but it's rare to see just one live-action show hanging out in a sea of animated offerings. Maybe CartoonLand is testing the waters for more live-action content, or perhaps Prank Patrol has a particular appeal they're trying to capitalize on? It's peculiar but intriguing.\n\n**User3: Animation_Admirer**\n\nMissing Kikoriki big time! It had a charm that's hard to come by in a lot of today's cartoons. It straddled the line between silly and serious in a way that was very accessible for both kids and adults. I hope CartoonLand considers bringing it back, or at least adds something with a similar vibe to their roster.\n\nRegarding Prank Patrol, it does feel like an outlier. Sometimes, channels throw in something unexpected to see if it sticks, diversify content, or simply fill a slot until something more fitting comes along. It could be any number of reasons, but it does spark curiosity about the future direction of CartoonLand's programming strategy. Are they going to introduce more live-action shows, or is this just a one-off experiment?\n\n**User4: QuirkyToons**\n\nI've been feeling the absence of Kikoriki something fierce. It's one of those shows that managed to be both whimsical and wise, and I haven't found anything quite like it on CartoonLand since it left the airwaves. There's nothing else that quite matches its blend of heartwarming and humorous storytelling.\n\nAnd yeah, Prank Patrol does feel a bit like the odd one out. Maybe CartoonLand is trying to branch out, or maybe they're just filling a time slot until they can secure more animated content? It's puzzling but somewhat refreshing too, seeing something different in the lineup. Though, I do hope they lean back into what they're best at \u2014 fabulous, feel-good cartoons like Kikoriki.\n\n**User5: ToonTalk**\n\nBring back Kikoriki! That show had layers, people. Layers! It wasn\u2019t afraid to tackle complex themes under the guise of simplicity, which is a rarity. Each character brought something special to the table, and it was genuinely funny. \n\nAbout Prank Patrol, it's really a head-scratcher why a predominantly cartoon channel would choose this as their sole live-action series. Maybe it's because of the interactive, reality-based entertainment angle? It provides contrast, sure, but I think most of us come to CartoonLand for our animated fix, so it's a curious choice. Here's hoping it\u2019s either a successful experiment or just a temporary excursion into live-action territory."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a follow up wondering why PP moved into its former time slot and not BFDI, Squish or even Johnny Test "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**Thread Title: Why Did Prank Patrol Take Over THAT Time Slot?**\n\n**User1: CartoonConundrum**\n\nHey, CartoonLand watchers!\n\nSo, Prank Patrol has snuck into the time slot that used to be home to some of our favorites. I\u2019m puzzled - why not give that golden slot to shows like Battle for Dream Island (BFDI), Squish, or even Johnny Test? Each of these has a strong following and seems like they\u2019d fit perfectly into the prime-time frame that's now occupied by Prank Patrol. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Prank Patrol is fun, but it\u2019s a stark shift from what one would expect.\n\nWhat do you all think about this decision? Any insights or theories?\n\n**User2: TimeSlotSleuth**\n\nIt\u2019s a real head-scratcher indeed! BFDI and Squish have particularly loyal fanbases, and given their animated nature, they're more in line with what we'd expect in prime-time CartoonLand. Johnny Test, even if it's just Season 1, has enough of a nostalgic punch to bring in viewers. \n\nPrank Patrol\u2019s movement into this coveted slot could be CartoonLand's attempt at shaking things up or appealing to a different demographic. It feels like they're experimenting with their programming strategy, trying to see if a live-action format can pull in prime-time viewers. Still... it's a gamble that's left many of us scratching our heads.\n\n**User3: AnimatedThoughts**\n\nCompletely agree with what's been said. It makes me wonder if there\u2019s something bigger at play with CartoonLand's scheduling and content strategy. Moving Prank Patrol into what many consider prime real estate in TV scheduling does raise more than a few eyebrows. \n\nBFDI, with its quirky charm and cult following, or even Squish, which has its own allure, seems like a missed opportunity for that time slot. Are they perhaps underestimating the appeal of these shows? Or is this a strategic move to diversify the audience by integrating more live-action during peak times? It\u2019s all conjecture at this point but fascinating to think about.\n\n**User4: ToonTactics**\n\nIt's definitely an odd choice on the surface. Prank Patrol has its merit, sure, but I was really hoping BFDI would get more spotlight. There\u2019s a vibrant community around that show, and it could\u2019ve benefited massively from the exposure. \n\nMaybe CartoonLand is banking on the unique appeal of Prank Patrol to draw in viewers who might not typically tune in for cartoons? It\u2019s possible they\u2019re testing how well live-action content performs in a slot typically reserved for popular animations. Still, it\u2019s a risky move that could alienate the core audience if not handled correctly.\n\n**User5: RetroToonLover**\n\nI miss the days when the prime-time slot was a showcase for the best animated content CartoonLand had to offer. BFDI, Squish, or even Johnny Test would have made my evenings. It seems like a strange pivot to Prank Patrol, but who knows? Maybe they\u2019ve got data or feedback suggesting this could work.\n\nIt\u2019s possibly a strategic diversification, testing waters that CartoonLand hasn't fully explored. Yet, part of me can't help but feel they\u2019re overlooking a golden opportunity with their current animated roster.

I'm seeing a lot of great new shows gaining traction, but there's still a bit of unresolved business. I've seen some chatter about what should really take up that now-infamous slot. What's everyone thinking these days?\n\n**User2: ToonStrategist**\n\nHonestly, I've given this a lot of thought, and I keep coming back to a show that's really proven itself: Chaotic. It has the depth, the engaging storyline, and frankly, it's something that could hold its own in that prime slot. Giving it to Chaotic feels like it could be a smart move. The fan base is there, and it might bring back some of the Kikoriki crowd looking for something with substance. Anyone else feeling this way?\n\n**User3: RetroWatcher**\n\nI see where you're coming from, ToonStrategist. Chaotic does have its appeal, and it's definitely a worthy contender for that prime slot. But the question remains \u2013 is CartoonLand looking to maintain the animation magic, or are they going to keep experimenting with live-action like they did with Prank Patrol? It's a bit of a gamble whichever direction they go.\n\n**User4: NewToonFan**\n\nAs someone who jumped onto the CartoonLand bandwagon after the whole Kikoriki saga, I find the diversity in programming quite refreshing. While I do appreciate the merit of shows like Chaotic, I think CartoonLand's strategy might be to mix things up. However, giving Chaotic the slot could indeed be a nod to the channel's roots and might balance the current lineup well.\n\n**User5: KikorikiLoyalist**\n\nI'm still holding out hope for a Kikoriki comeback, but if that's off the table, Chaotic would definitely get my vote. It\u2019s complex, entertaining, and has that pull that could really captivate the audience Kikoriki left behind. CartoonLand has been unpredictable, though, so while \"Give it to Chaotic\" is a rallying cry I can get behind, who knows what they'll do?\n\n**User6: AnimationAdvocate**\n\nThere's something to be said about Chaotic's storytelling that makes it stand out. The depth of its universe and character development is something that's been missing since Kikoriki's departure. \"Give it to Chaotic\" isn't just about filling a slot; it's about giving the audience a world to get lost in again. However, CartoonLand's recent direction suggests they're experimenting with broader content beyond just captivating storylines.

Time to retire those prank supplies for good!\n\n**User3: PranksterGoneFan**\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, I didn\u2019t mind \u201cBarney & the Ninjas\u201d. Their pranks had their moments, but nothing beats the wholesome and hilarious world of Kikoriki. It\u2019s great that CartoonLand is bringing back the classics. That slot deserved a show with a legacy, and I\u2019m thrilled Kikoriki is it. Welcome back, old friends!\n\n**User4: ToonNostalgiaBuff**\n\nTruly the end of an era and the start of another! \u201cBarney & The Ninjas\u201d had a good run, but it\u2019s time to welcome back the show that has a special place in our hearts. The Kikoriki renewal feels like CartoonLand is listening to its audience, and I couldn\u2019t be happier. Here\u2019s to more adventures with our favorite round, fluffy friends. Kikoriki crew \u2013 assemble!\n\n**User5: AnimationAnalyst**\n\nRenewing the Kikoriki contract is a smart move by CartoonLand, signaling a return to their roots and showing a strong commitment to quality storytelling. While \u201cBarney & The Ninjas\u201d was an interesting experiment in live-action content, Kikoriki\u2019s timeless appeal and beloved characters are what the audience truly loves. This renewal could mark a new golden era for CartoonLand. Excited to see where it leads!\n\n**User6: NewGenToonWatcher**\n\nAs someone who missed Kikoriki during its original run and got used to the pranks from \u201cBarney & The Ninjas\u201d, I\u2019m curious and excited to see what all the fuss is about. It\u2019s clear this show has a passionate fanbase, and I\u2019m looking forward to discovering its appeal firsthand. Here\u2019s to new beginnings and diving into the Kikoriki world!"}]}, {"facetValue": "The user engaged in a discussion about CartoonLand programming, expressing concerns and nostalgia for certain shows.

Just wanted to start a thread dedicated to CartoonLand's current lineup. I must say, they've got a solid mix of shows at the moment. Shows like \"The Owl\" and \"Inanimate Insanity\" have been huge hits in our household. They've managed to balance a mix of action, comedy, and even some learning content quite well. What does everyone else think?\n\nUser2: Definitely agree on the diversity of the lineup. My kids are huge fans of \"Johnny Test\" (though only Season 1 being available is a bummer) and \"TMNT\" (Fast Forward). However, they have expressed some disappointment over the loss of \"Kikoriki\" from the lineup. It was a unique show with memorable characters, and we all enjoyed the humor and adventures. Does anyone else miss it too?\n\nUser3: Oh, absolutely! \"Kikoriki\" had a charm to it that's hard to replace. My little one would watch it on repeat and the lessons it subtly taught were invaluable. It's a shame CartoonLand removed it. That said, \"Code Lyoko\" and \"Xiaolin Showdown\" have somewhat filled that void with their adventurous plots. But still, \"Kikoriki\" will always have a special place in our hearts.\n\nUser4: \"Kikoriki\" was a staple in our home as well. It's tough to see good shows go. On another note, I'm thrilled to see \"Skatoony\" make it to the lineup. It's a nice blend of cartoon and live-action game show that's incredibly entertaining for both kids and parents. Also, has anyone's kids gotten into \"The Hollow\"? My kids just started it and are hooked! \n\nUser5: Yes to \"The Hollow\"! It's got that mystery element nailed down. My kids love piecing together the puzzles in each episode. Speaking of changes, how does everyone feel about \"Prank Patrol\" being the only live-action show now? My kids find it hilarious, but I miss the variety that older live-action shows brought to the table.\n\nUser6: \"Prank Patrol\" is a hit here too. I do understand the sentiment about missing the variety. My family enjoyed when there were more live-action options. It provided a nice break from cartoons. Also, it's interesting to see \"Horrid Henry\" still holding strong. That show's been around for a while but never seems to lose its appeal!\n\nUser1: Thanks for all the input, everyone! It's great to see so much engagement and to hear what shows your families are enjoying or missing. The variety in CartoonLand's programming seems to cater to a lot of tastes, but it's clear that classics like \"Kikoriki\" will always be missed.

Just found out that \"Squish\" is joining the limited episodes club, just like \"Johnny Test\" and \"TMNT\" (Fast Forward) before it. They're only going to air the first 8 episodes\u2013for now, at least. Thoughts?\n\nUser2: Oh no, not \"Squish\" too! My kids were really getting into it, and limiting it to only 8 episodes seems like such an odd choice. They've done this with a couple of other shows, but I was hoping they wouldn't continue this trend. It's so frustrating when shows just start to develop and then get cut off like that.\n\nUser3: That's disappointing news indeed. \"Squish\" had so much potential, and limiting its episodes really hampers the enjoyment. Out of curiosity, has CartoonLand given any reason for this trend? It seems counterintuitive to only air a fraction of a series, especially when those series are well received.\n\nUser4: I've noticed this happening but haven't seen any official reason from CartoonLand. My guess? It could be a strategy to gauge audience interest before fully committing to longer series runs. Or perhaps licensing issues? Either way, it's certainly a bummer for viewers who get invested in these worlds and characters.\n\nUser5: This is becoming a bit of a pattern, isn't it? Quite frustrating as a viewer, especially for the kids who don't understand why their new favorite show suddenly stops airing new episodes. \"Squish\" was becoming a fast favorite in our house. I understand testing the waters, but this seems like an odd way to do it.\n\nUser6: Agreed with everyone's points. It seems like an odd strategy to build a loyal audience. On a side note, has anyone reached out to CartoonLand for clarification or to express these concerns? Maybe if enough of us voice our thoughts on this practice, they might reconsider how they handle new and existing shows.\n\nUser1: That's a great idea, User6. Maybe we can draft a message or a petition as a community expressing our concerns and how this practice affects our viewing habits and attachment to their network. It's worth a shot, and maybe it can bring about a change or at least get us some answers.\n\nUser7: Count me in for supporting a petition or any outreach effort.

Set in the whimsical world of Kikoriki Island, the series followed the lives of its round, fluffy inhabitants as they embarked on adventures that were as much about discovering the world around them as they were about self-discovery. The charm of \"Kikoriki\" lay not just in its humor and delightful storytelling but in the subtle life lessons it imparted, making it a cherished part of daily viewing routines. Its absence from the channel has left fans craving the wholesome, feel-good content that Kikoriki so effortlessly delivered.\n\n**Dude, That's My Ghost!**\nA more contemporary offering, \"Dude, That's My Ghost!\" captured the imagination of viewers with its unique premise, dynamic characters, and a refreshing blend of comedy and supernatural elements. The show centered on the life of Spencer Wright, a budding filmmaker and the only one who could see his best friend, Billy Joe Cobra, a ghost and a former pop star. Their antics, often leading to chaotic but hilarious situations, struck a chord with audiences who found joy in the show's clever writing, vibrant animation, and the genuine camaraderie between Spencer and Billy. The removal of \"Dude, That's My Ghost!\" from the lineup has left a gap that fans are eager to see filled, hoping for a revival or at least reruns of this much-loved series.\n\nBoth \"Kikoriki\" and \"Dude, That's My Ghost!\" represent the essence of what makes CartoonLand so special to its viewers \u2014 the ability to transport them to worlds where joy, friendship, and adventure reign supreme.

Is anyone else as upset as I am?\n\n**RetroToonLover**: Totally with you, ToonFanatic101. \"Kikoriki\" was a gem! It had humor, life lessons, everything.

But surprisingly, I adjusted pretty quickly to a few other shows on CartoonLand. Wanted to share for anyone else missing our stretchy, orange friend.\n\n1. **Battle for BFDI (BFB)** - The unique characters and hilarious challenges have really captivated me. It's not the same shape-shifting fun, but the creativity in character design and storyline had me hooked from the get-go.\n\n2. **Horrid Henry** - I honestly didn't expect to enjoy the misadventures of Henry as much as I do. While it's way more human-centric, the mischief and antics Henry gets into remind me of the unpredictable nature of Lamput - always keeping you guessing what's next.\n\n3. **Robotboy** - This one's a bit of a throwback, but its mix of action and humor, along with the high-stakes cat-and-mouse chases, give me those Lamput vibes I've been missing. Plus, the whole idea of a character hiding in plain sight and trying to understand the human world has its parallels.\n\nHas anyone else found any shows that helped bridge the gap left by Lamput's departure?\n\n**OrangeJelly**: Totally agree with you on **BFB**! It's the diverse personalities and the camaraderie that really fill a bit of that Lamput-shaped hole in my heart.

The show's energy is contagious, and while it's a completely different premise, I find that it satisfies a similar itch for entertainment full of mischief and laughs.\n\n**TechyFan**: Oh, **Robotboy** is a classic! Good call on that one. The action scenes and the whole secret-identity aspect really provide that excitement. I've also found **Chop Socky Chooks** to somehow ease the void.

It used to be one of his staples, right beside the adventures of Pogoroo and Chiko. But, I must say, his tastes are evolving with the channel's current programming, and it's been quite the transition!\n\nHe's now utterly captivated by the quirky charm of Squish and cannot get enough of the misadventures of Horrid Henry\u2014probably sees a bit of himself in the master of mischief, if I'm being honest. Battle for Dream Island (BFDI) has become a surprising hit in our household, with its unique characters and engaging battles; it's a topic of dinner table discussions nowadays. He's also taken a liking to TMNT Fast Forward, though I sense it's the futuristic setting that grabs his attention more than anything.\n\nAnd let's not forget The Owl; its humor seems to tickle him just right, making it a much-waited-for part of his weekday TV lineup.\n\n**While** we have these new favorites, he still occasionally asks, \"Why did Kikoriki disappear?\" Anyone else's kids missing Kikoriki from the lineup? I've tried explaining that shows come and go to make room for new ones, but you know how it is with their favorites.\n\n**How do you folks handle these transitions with your kids? And have your little ones found new favorites among the current lineup like mine has? Would love to hear your stories and maybe get some tips on easing the \"loss\" of a beloved show!**\n\n---\n\n**Reply by: ToonParent123**\n\nOh, we've been through our share of \"Missing Show Syndrome\" in our household, CartoonFanatic101! My tactic has been to introduce similar shows from the current programming to fill that void. Seems like you're already on that track with Squish, Horrid Henry, and others.\n\nKikoriki was a hit in our house too, and it took some time for the kids to stop asking for it. We got into Robotboy and Monster Allergy for a bit of that adventure and friendship vibe they loved so much in Kikoriki. Perhaps you could lean into some shows that have similar themes or humor?\n\n---\n\n**Reply by: NewToonsFan**\n\nThis is all too relatable! My strategy has been to hype up the new additions as \"special premieres\" or \"exclusive shows\" to create excitement. It helped transition from mourning the loss of one show to the eager anticipation of another. For Kikoriki, maybe you can find it streaming somewhere or get DVDs? That way, it's not really \"gone,\" just moved to a special place for whenever the new favorites don't cut it.\n\n---\n\n**Reply by: AnimationStation**\n\nTotally understand this! I think what works for us is mixing things up with online content related to their missed favorites while warmly embracing the new shows. Also, engaging them in conversations about what exactly they loved about Kikoriki can help identify new shows with similar themes or characters. Sometimes it's the camaraderie, other times it's the humor, and finding that in new shows might soften the blow.

I've noticed that some shows on CartoonLand, much like with Johnny Test (where we only get Season 1), only grace our screens for a single season. This got me thinking and, frankly, a bit curious about the reasons behind these \"one-season wonders.\"\n\nFor instance, Johnny Test Season 1 brings so much joy and laughter into our home, and just as we're fully invested, we're left hanging, craving more of the Test family's escapades. This pattern seems to replicate with a few other series on the channel as well.\n\nSo, my question to you all, and perhaps even to the CartoonLand planners lurking among us: **Why do some shows only air one season?** Is it a licensing thing, audience reception, or perhaps part of keeping the content fresh and diverse? \n\nAlso, **how do you folks navigate this with your kids?** Do you look for other seasons elsewhere, do you recap the one season as a completed story, or do you seamlessly shift their attention to another show on CartoonLand's rich roster?\n\nAnd finally, **is there a way for us, as a community, to show support for certain shows** that we\u2019d love to see more of? Maybe our collective voice could bring back or extend the life of some \"one-season wonders\" on CartoonLand.\n\nLooking forward to your insights, stories, and advice on navigating this with our young and impressionable viewers!\n\n---\n\n**Reply by: ToonParent123**\n\nGreat points, CartoonFanatic101! It does feel like a tease sometimes, getting so invested in a show, only to have it end abruptly. I've always assumed it was due to licensing issues or perhaps the shows not performing as expected. We usually try to find the rest of the series on streaming platforms if possible, to give our kids some closure.\n\n---\n\n**Reply by: NewToonsFan**\n\nI've been there too! It's tough explaining to a little one why their new favorite show isn't coming back for more adventures. I'd love to know if there's a possibility of campaigns or petitions we could start to show our interest in more seasons. Sometimes it feels like decisions are made without considering how much these shows mean to our families.\n\n---\n\n**Reply by: AnimationStation**\n\nThis is a recurring puzzle in our household as well. It often leads us on a hunt for similar shows to fill the gap. However, understanding the intricacies behind these decisions would certainly help in explaining things to our young viewers. Also, knowing there's a way to possibly influence more content would be empowering for us as a viewer base!"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a tweet about 6 shows a parent says their Lamput loving girl switched to easily"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Just discovered my little Lamput fan has seamlessly switched her affection to 6 new shows! \ud83d\udcfa\u2728 From the quirky antics in Squish and the adventures in Horrid Henry, to the inventive battles in BFDI, the futuristic Fast Forward, the wise-cracking The Owl, and the dynamic Code Lyoko.

It was such a unique show that offered both humor and lessons for the little ones. And with TMNT, the Fast Forward season brought a fresh twist to the series we all grew fondly of. My kids have been hooked, to say the least!\n\nI've been out of the loop for a while, so I'm wondering if there's been any whisper or hint about Kikoriki possibly making a return to CartoonLand? It seemed like such a staple that disappeared too soon. Also, has there been any talk about TMNT continuing past the Fast Forward season here? Would love to catch more of the TMNT universe if it's in the works.\n\nWould appreciate any info you guys have or speculative thoughts on whether these might see the light of day once more on our screens.

As far as I know, there's been no official word on Kikoriki\u2019s return yet, which is a bummer. It was truly one-of-a-kind. Regarding TMNT moving past Fast Forward, I haven\u2019t heard anything concrete, but with the way nostalgia\u2019s been a key player in show revivals lately, I wouldn't lose hope!\n\n**Reply by: ModernToonsAdvocate**\n\nI feel you, @ToonNostalgiaParent! Kikoriki had such a charm to it that's hard to find in recent shows. And TMNT never gets old, no matter the season. There\u2019s been a lot of fan chatter online about wanting more TMNT, specifically beyond Fast Forward, but no official announcements yet. Fingers crossed that CartoonLand listens to the fans!\n\n**Reply by: AnimationInsider**\n\nHey all! While I don\u2019t have insider info on Kikoriki, there\u2019s always a possibility for returns with enough fan interest. These decisions often come down to licensing and demand. As for TMNT, the series has a robust fanbase, and there\u2019s always potential for more content if the demand is shown. Keep the conversation going online.

My kid\u2019s latest obsession has been Chaotic\u2014and I must admit, I've found myself getting quite engrossed in the episodes too. The complexity, the action, and those wild strategies have sparked some fun, imaginative playtimes and discussions at home. It\u2019s been a fantastic journey watching my kid get so passionate about a show, analyzing the characters' moves and plotting their own strategies.\n\n**But** there's more exciting news on the horizon for CartoonLand viewers! It appears some **furry friends** are making their way back to the lineup, stepping in to replace Prank Patrol. While we\u2019ve had quite a few laughs with Prank Patrol, the anticipation of what these \"furry friends\" could be is building up. The hints so far suggest a return of some beloved animal characters that many of us have fondly missed!\n\nSo, what are your guesses? Which furry friends do you think are making a comeback? And how have your kids (or perhaps you!) adapted to the changing show roster on CartoonLand?\n\nWould love to hear how other shows like Chaotic have caught the imagination of your little ones and how you\u2019re feeling about this upcoming transition from Prank Patrol to our mystery furry friends.

It's amazing how shows like these can spark so much creativity and strategic thinking in kids.

Prank Patrol has had a good run, but there's something special about those shows with animal characters that teach compassion, friendship, and sometimes, a bit of mischief.

This calls for a celebration for fans old and new. The adventures of Krash, Chiko, Rosa, and the gang have been sorely missed, and it's fantastic to hear they'll be gracing our screens once more.\n\nIn light of this exciting development, I've been pondering about show pairings that would complement the whimsical world of Kikoriki. Given the channel's current lineup, pairing it with The Owl & The Owl & Co (TO/TO&C) and YooHoo and Friends (YH&F) could create a delightful block of fun, adventure, and learning for our kids. Both sets of shows carry a light-hearted tone coupled with important lessons, making them perfect companions to Kikoriki's unique blend of humor and morals.\n\nOn another note, amidst this joyous return, a question lingers in the back of my mind\u2014what about Lamput? The show garnered quite the following with its hilarious cat-and-mouse game, or should I say, doctor-and-Lamput chase.

Those shows together would cover such a wide array of themes and humor, perfect for a family-friendly block.

There\u2019s something about that first season that really resonates with the audience, making it a bit of a cult classic.\n\n**User3: ToonMaster98**\n\nI have to give a shout out to \"Code Lyoko\". It's amazing how well that show has held up over the years, and it has a rather dedicated following in the forums.

I feel like it doesn\u2019t get enough love, but it has a solid viewership. Also, \"Squish\" seems to be gaining traction lately, perhaps appealing to the same audience that enjoys \"Inanimate Insanity\". I guess it\u2019s hard to narrow it down to just six since CartoonLand has done a great job catering to various tastes.\n\n**User6: RetroToonCollector**\n\nWe're all sleeping on \"Skatoony (UK)\"!

They're practically everywhere - from the channel's social media accounts to the banner ads on the website. The lineup includes \"The Owl and Co\", \"Battle for Dream Island\", \"Squish\", \"Robotboy\", and \"Horrid Henry\". It feels like these five are getting a lot more spotlight than the rest. What's everyone's take on this? \n\n**User18: AnimatedFan**\n\nYeah, @ToonTalker, I've definitely seen the push! Especially for \"The Owl and Co.\" It's like every time I tune in or check out CartoonLand's social media, there\u2019s something new about it. Maybe they\u2019re gearing up for a new season or special episodes? Either way, it does seem like these shows are being positioned as the channel's flagship content for the moment.\n\n**User19: PrimeTimeTooner**\n\nI've noticed that too, and honestly, I'm here for it. \"The Owl and Co\" has been one of my favorites for a while, so I'm glad to see it getting the love it deserves. However, I do hope that CartoonLand balances its promotions so other shows don't get overshadowed. It\u2019s important to give every show a chance to shine and attract its audience.\n\n**User20: NicheToonAdmirer**\n\nAs much as I love \"The Owl and Co\" and the other four, I wish CartoonLand would diversify their advertising a bit more. There are some hidden gems in their programming that aren\u2019t getting enough attention due to the heavy promotion of these five. Variety is the spice of life, after all. Maybe they could spotlight a different show each week? \n\n**User21: FutureAnimator**\n\nIt makes sense from a marketing perspective to push the shows that have the broadest appeal or are currently in the pipeline for new content. \"The Owl and Co\" and \"Battle for Dream Island\" have huge fan bases, and it's no surprise CartoonLand wants to capitalize on that. Still, I agree with @NicheToonAdmirer, it would be great to see more of the less-talked-about shows get some promotional love too. \n\n**Moderator: CartoonLandVoice**\n\nHello, CartoonLand fans! Thank you for sharing your observations and thoughts. It's exciting to see such passionate discussions about our programming. We want to assure you that while \"The Owl and Co\", \"Battle for Dream Island\", \"Squish\", \"Robotboy\", and \"Horrid Henry\" are indeed currently in the spotlight, we are continually evaluating how to effectively promote all our shows, ensuring each one gets its moment to shine.

Then, there are those unique, whimsical creations that, for one reason or another, slip through the cracks, only to be rediscovered years later as hidden gems. One such show that deserves a spotlight shone on its obscure brilliance is \"Quat'Zieux,\" known to English-speaking audiences as \"Four Eyes!\"\n\n\"Quat'Zieux\" premiered in the early 2000s, introducing viewers to the endearing and quirky tale of Emma, a young alien girl with a distinctive four eyes. The show broke ground not just with its imaginative premise but also through its heartwarming storytelling and universal themes. Emma's journey begins in an unusual manner - she's deported from her home planet to Earth as a consequence of flunking the 5th grade. This unusual setup serves as a perfect backdrop for a series of adventures and learning experiences that are both entertaining and enlightening.\n\nThe central theme of \"Quat'Zieux\" revolves around adaptation and understanding. Emma, being from another planet, struggles to fit in with her human peers. However, it's through these challenges that the show explores deeper themes of acceptance, friendship, and the importance of embracing one's uniqueness. Each episode, while filled with humorous antics and galactic misunderstandings, carries a message that resonates with audiences of all ages.\n\nA key aspect that makes \"Quat'Zieux\" stand out is its animation style. The show's creators employed a vibrant color palette and character designs that were innovative for its time, perfectly encapsulating the alien yet oddly familiar world Emma had to navigate. This visual uniqueness, combined with the charming storytelling, makes it a feast for the senses and imagination.\n\nDespite its many virtues, \"Quat'Zieux\" did not achieve widespread popularity during its initial run. There are several theories as to why this might be the case, ranging from the saturation of animated series at the time to the show's marketing. However, like many underappreciated works of art, it has found a new lease of life in the age of the internet. Fans old and new have come together to share their appreciation for this quirky slice of cartoon history, celebrating its creativity, humor, and the lessons it imparted.\n\nIn retrospect, \"Quat'Zieux\" can be seen as a precursor to many modern shows that blend humor, heart, and the fantastical in unique ways. It reminds us that sometimes the most impactful stories come from the most unexpected places. For anyone looking to explore the rich tapestry of animated television, revisiting \"Quat'Zieux\" (Four Eyes!) offers a delightful glimpse into a show that, despite its obscurity, shines with the enduring themes of friendship, acceptance, and the joy of discovering one's place in the world. \n\nIn celebrating \"Quat'Zieux,\" we not only pay tribute to a forgotten gem but also to the limitless potential of animation to bring to life stories that are whimsical, poignant, and eternally relevant. Let's hope that Emma's adventures on Earth continue to inspire and entertain new generations of viewers, proving that even the most unlikely of heroes can make a lasting impact."}, {"role": "user", "content": "It aired on CITV in the UK for a brief period (while it was still Horrid Henry, Pokemon and 4Kids TV imports)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Embarking on its journey into the hearts of UK audiences, \"Quat'Zieux\" (Four Eyes!) found a brief home on CITV, a channel renowned for its eclectic mix of programming, including popular hits like \"Horrid Henry,\" \"Pokemon,\" and various 4Kids TV imports. Its appearance on CITV during this era marked a unique moment in the network's history, showcasing its willingness to explore diverse and innovative storytelling avenues.\n\nDespite competing in a landscape dominated by heavyweights and fan-favorite shows, \"Quat'Zieux\" managed to carve out its own niche, captivating a segment of the audience with its distinctive charm and the compelling narrative of Emma, the four-eyed alien girl navigating the complexities of life on Earth. This period was a vibrant time for children's television in the UK, with a variety of shows catering to different tastes and interests. Amidst this array of programming, \"Quat'Zieux\" stood out for its unique premise\u2014a testament to CITV's dedication to offering varied content.\n\nThe show's stint on CITV, albeit brief, is a period remembered fondly by those who chanced upon it. \"Quat'Zieux\" benefitted from the channel's broad reach, allowing it to touch the lives of many young viewers across the UK.  Its presence amid shows like \"Horrid Henry,\" which delved into the mischievous adventures of its titular character, and \"Pokemon,\" a globally beloved franchise about the journey of becoming a Pok\u00e9mon Master, highlighted the diversity in storytelling that CITV aimed to deliver. \"Quat'Zieux\" added to this tapestry with its interplanetary narrative, blending educational themes with entertainment \u2014 a hallmark of many memorable children's shows.\n\nHowever, like many hidden gems, \"Quat'Zieux\" didn't maintain a permanent spot in the limelight. The reasons for its brief tenure on CITV could be manifold, ranging from the ever-evolving programming needs of the channel to the competitive landscape of children's television, which sees many shows vying for young viewers' attention. Yet, its impact during its airing was undeniable for those who became its fans. The show offered a different perspective, wrapped in the guise of an animated series, on themes like fitting in, the value of education, and the power of friendship.\n\nIn retrospect, the fleeting presence of \"Quat'Zieux\" on CITV's lineup highlights the transient nature of television programming, where shows come and go, some leaving a lasting imprint while others fade into obscurity. For aficionados of animation and UK television history, however, the brief airing of \"Quat'Zieux\" serves as a reminder of the diversity and richness of programming available to children in the early 2000s. It's a call to always be on the lookout for those unique, offbeat offerings that, despite not achieving mainstream success, enrich the viewing experience with their heartfelt stories and imaginative worlds.\n\nAs we continue to navigate the vast landscape of children's television, the story of \"Quat'Zieux\" on CITV encourages us to cherish and seek out those special shows that, even if only briefly, light up the screen with their creativity and message.

To the best of my knowledge, there is no existing cartoon with the specific plotline about an alien girl named Emma deported to Earth for failing 5th grade in the described context. It seems the initial description could have been confused with or inspired by elements from other animated series or perhaps an amalgamation of various shows' themes.\n\nHowever, the concept imagined offers a fascinating springboard to discuss themes commonly explored in children's animated series, such as the experience of being an outsider, the challenges of adapting to a new environment, and the journey towards acceptance and understanding\u2014both self and societal. Many animated shows delve into these themes, often portraying characters from other worlds or with unique attributes trying to fit into a society that's new or foreign to them.\n\nFor instance, shows like \"My Life as a Teenage Robot\" present a protagonist who is literally not human (a robot, in this case) but deals with many human issues such as identity, acceptance, and the longing to fit in. Similarly, \"Lilo & Stitch: The Series\" explores the concept of familial love, friendship, and acceptance through the adventures of a young Hawaiian girl and her alien 'dog,' showcasing how beings from different worlds can form unbreakable bonds.\n\nMoreover, educational cartoons often incorporate extraterrestrial or fantastical characters to discuss and teach real-world issues and subjects in an engaging manner, making the imagined premise of \"Quat'Zieux\" not far removed from the thematic elements present in many beloved children's shows.\n\nThese series leverage the appeal of alien or otherworldly protagonists to widen the viewers' imaginations and foster empathy by presenting relatable challenges in fantastical wrappers. They teach valuable lessons about diversity, tolerance, and the importance of embracing differences, often leading to the realization that, deep down, we share many commonalities regardless of our backgrounds or origins.\n\nWhile the specific plotline involving an alien girl named Emma might not correspond to a known show, the themes it suggests embody the heart and soul of children's animation. These stories encourage young audiences to look beyond the surface, promote inclusive values, and inspire a sense of wonder about the universe and the diverse beings that might inhabit it, fictional or otherwise.\n\nThe conversation around such an imaginative show\u2014though seemingly fictional\u2014highlights the power and impact of animation as a storytelling medium, capable of bridging worlds and bringing to life stories that entertain, educate, and inspire."}, {"role": "user", "content": "It's extremely obscure, In fact, I'd go as far as to say its the most obscure toon EVER, Even more so than Wubbzy or Will and Dewitt"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The realm of animated television is vast, with thousands of shows having been produced and aired around the globe, catering to various tastes, cultures, and age groups.

Indeed, the charm of animation lies not only in its universal appeal but also in its ability to breed a rich variety of content, some of which flies under the radar to become the kind of obscure gems aficionados love to discover. Shows like \"Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!\" and \"Will and Dewitt\" themselves have fanbases and are remembered by those who grew up watching them, despite not having the widespread recognition of giants like \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" or \"The Simpsons.\"\n\nGiven this context, the mention of \"Quat'Zieux\" (Four Eyes!) contributes to the tapestry of little-known animated series, even if, in this case, it appears to be a mix-up or misunderstanding. However, discussing it invites an interesting exploration into what makes a show \"obscure\" and how certain series achieve cult status or become a treasured piece of someone's childhood memories despite not achieving widespread fame.\n\nObscurity in animation can come from various factors:\n\n1. **Limited Regional Release:** Some shows have a brief run in specific regions or countries and never see international distribution. This makes them obscure outside their original broadcast area but possibly well-loved within it.\n\n2. **Short Run Time:** Series that are canceled early or designed as mini-series can easily fall into obscurity due to their brief presence on the air.\n\n3. **Niche Audience:** Shows that target a very specific audience are less likely to break into the mainstream but can become highly valued within their target demographic.\n\n4. **Lack of Accessibility:** If a show isn't available on popular streaming platforms or for purchase, it\u2019s harder for new audiences to discover it, which can lead to its status as an obscure title.\n\n5. **Changing Viewing Trends:** The way people consume content has evolved, with streaming platforms now dominating what was once the territory of cable and network television. Shows that aired in less digitally connected times without a transition to new formats may slip into obscurity.\n\nDespite the obscurity, these shows can leave a lasting impact on their viewers, offering unique stories, perspectives, and artistry that resonate on a personal level. The discussions they spark, much like the one around \"Quat'Zieux,\" not only shed light on the vast and varied landscape of animation but also underscore the medium's power to connect, entertain, and inspire, regardless of how many people ultimately see it.\n\nIn celebrating obscure animations, we're reminded that every creation has value, often holding a special place in someone's heart or offering a unique window into different cultures and storytelling traditions. Whether or not \"Quat'Zieux\" exists as described, its invocation enriches the conversation about animation's hidden treasures, encouraging exploration and appreciation of the lesser-known corners of the animated world."}]}]}, {"summary": "The user participated in discussions about television lineup changes, focusing on children's programming and its impact on viewers.

Anyone Else Seeing This?\n\nAnimeFan93:\n\nHey everyone,\n\nSo, this Saturday morning, I turned on CW4Kids expecting the usual lineup, but to my surprise, the schedule was straight out of early 2007 Kids WB! I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s some kind of glitch, a special event, or a permanent change, but it was a total blast from the past.\n\nHere\u2019s what the lineup looked like before, from 7am to 12pm:\n\n7:00 AM - Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds\n7:30 AM - Viva Pinata \n8:00 AM - GoGoRiki\n8:30 AM - The Spectacular Spider Man\n9:00 AM - Chaotic \n9:30 AM - Huntik: Secrets and Seekers\n10:00 AM - Sonic X\n10:30 AM - Kirby: Right Back At Ya\n11:00 AM - Dinosaur King\n11:30 AM - TMNT: Fast Forward\n\nAnd here\u2019s what aired today:\n\n7:00 AM - Loonatics Unleashed\n7:30 AM - Xiaolin Showdown\n8:00 AM - Johnny Test\n8:30 AM - Legion of Super Heroes\n9:00 AM - The Batman\n9:30 AM - Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!\n10:00 AM - Tom and Jerry Tales\n10:30 AM - Monster Allergy\n11:00 AM - Spider Riders\n11:30 AM - Magi-Nation\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Is it happening nationwide, or just on my local station? I checked the official CW4Kids website and their social media, but there\u2019s no mention of reverting to the old Kids WB lineup. Wondering if it\u2019s a technical glitch or maybe a surprise nostalgia event.\n\nWould love to hear if this is happening elsewhere!\n\nToonLover105:\n\nWow, that\u2019s crazy, AnimeFan93! I can\u2019t believe it. Haven\u2019t seen those shows on TV in years. I\u2019m elsewhere in the country, but all we got was the regular CW4Kids schedule this morning. Sounds like a fun glitch or a really cool event. I hope it\u2019s something they do more frequently if it\u2019s intentional!\n\nRetroFan88:\n\nNothing like that in my area, but man, what I wouldn\u2019t give to see Legion of Super Heroes and The Batman air again. It sounds like you hit a jackpot, AnimeFan93! Maybe it\u2019s a test run for a nostalgia block, or perhaps a one-off thing? Either way, super jealous here.\n\nDigitalWatcher101:\n\nI\u2019m a bit of a skeptic here - could it be that your TV guide was just not updated or glitched out? Sometimes, my TV does weird things, and I swear I\u2019m seeing content that isn\u2019t supposed to be there. Although, the lineup you described does sound like an awesome Saturday morning.\n\nNostalgiaNut45:\n\nNo way! They brought back Monster Allergy?! That\u2019s one of those underrated shows I never thought I\u2019d see on air again. I need to check my local listings and hope for a miracle here too. AnimeFan93, keep us posted if it happens again next weekend!\n\nAnimeFan93:\n\nThanks for the responses, everyone! I thought I was losing it for a moment there. I\u2019ll be sure to check again next Saturday and let you all know if the classic lineup airs once more or if it was just a one-time miracle. Fingers crossed it happens again \u2013 wouldn\u2019t mind reliving those childhood Saturday mornings a bit longer!\nWrite a follow up update the next week"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thread Update: Did the CW4Kids Classic Lineup Air Again? Here's What Happened!\n\nAnimeFan93:\n\nHey, everyone!\n\nAs promised, I\u2019m back with an update about the CW4Kids/early 2007 Kids WB lineup situation. So, I got up bright and early again this past Saturday, eagerly awaiting to see if last week's flashback was a one-off event or something more. Sadly, it looks like it was just a temporary glitch in the matrix\u2014this week reverted back to the usual CW4Kids schedule:\n\n7:00 AM - Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds\n7:30 AM - Viva Pinata\n8:00 AM - GoGoRiki\n8:30 AM - The Spectacular Spider-Man\n9:00 AM - Chaotic\n9:30 AM - Huntik: Secrets and Seekers\n10:00 AM - Sonic X\n10:30 AM - Kirby: Right Back At Ya\n11:00 AM - Dinosaur King\n11:30 AM - TMNT: Fast Forward\n\nI was really hoping that last week's lineup was a deliberate nostalgic event or perhaps a teaser for something bigger, but no such luck. This week, everything was back to normal with no sign of the classic Kids WB lineup. I did reach out to my local CW station and they mentioned a \"technical scheduling error\" last week, which led to the unexpected lineup. So, unfortunately, it doesn't look like a nostalgia block is in the works\u2014at least not officially.\n\nToonLover105:\n\nThat\u2019s a bummer, AnimeFan93! But hey, at least you got to experience that blast from the past, even if it was just for one week. Maybe the positive reaction to the glitch (at least from us nostalgic fans) might encourage them to consider a real throwback event in the future.\n\nRetroFan88:\n\nTotal letdown, but thanks for keeping us in the loop, AnimeFan93. I guess it\u2019s back to streaming services and DVDs to catch our old favorites. Still, fingers crossed that the powers-that-be see there\u2019s interest and give us a dedicated nostalgia block one of these days.\n\nDigitalWatcher101:\n\nMystery solved, then. Gotta love when technology throws us a curveball like that. At least it was a fun, albeit accidental, trip down memory lane for those who got to witness it!\n\nNostalgiaNut45:\n\nThanks for updating us, AnimeFan93. A bit sad it was just a technical error, but what a cool error to have, right? Maybe we should start a petition or something for a classic Saturday morning block \u2013 I bet there\u2019s more of us out there who\u2019d love this to become a reality.\n\nAnimeFan93:\n\nAppreciate all the responses and empathy, folks! I'm glad I wasn't alone in feeling the excitement. Maybe if there's enough buzz, something good will come out of it. And NostalgiaNut45, I like the way you think\u2014a petition could be interesting. Let's keep the hope alive and our fingers crossed. For now, though, it\u2019s back to finding our beloved classics through other means.

Well, there's been a surprising turn of events that I think many of you will find interesting.\n\nThis past Saturday, I geared up for my usual weekend cartoon binge, half expecting the regular CW4Kids schedule after the previous letdown. To my total astonishment, the classic Kids WB lineup was BACK! Only this time, it appears intentional, as the local station ran teasers hyping the return of our beloved shows. Here's the kicker, though: amidst the excitement of seeing shows like \"Legion of Super Heroes,\" \"The Batman,\" and \"Xiaolin Showdown\" back on air, I realized that \"Smeshariki/GoGoRiki\" and \"Sonic X\" were notably missing from the lineup.\n\nInstead, the lineup from 7am to 12pm was as follows:\n\n7:00 AM - Loonatics Unleashed\n7:30 AM - Xiaolin Showdown\n8:00 AM - Johnny Test\n8:30 AM - Legion of Super Heroes\n9:00 AM - The Batman\n9:30 AM - Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!\n10:00 AM - Tom and Jerry Tales\n10:30 AM - Monster Allergy\n11:00 AM - Spider Riders\n11:30 AM - Magi-Nation\n\nWhile it's thrilling to have the classic KWB shows back, the absence of \"Smeshariki/GoGoRiki\" and \"Sonic X\" did not go unnoticed. It's a bittersweet change; while we celebrate the return of many childhood favorites, fans of \"Sonic X\" and the quirky world of \"Smeshariki\" are left wanting.\n\nToonLover105:\n\nWow, I never thought they'd actually bring the KWB lineup back for real! It\u2019s amazing news, but missing \"Sonic X\" is a tough pill to swallow. That show was a huge part of my Saturday mornings. Maybe they\u2019re planning to rotate some shows in and out?\n\nRetroFan88:\n\nIncredible! This has got to be one of the best surprises this year. Crossing my fingers they'll find a way to bring \"Sonic X\" back, though. It deserves a spot in that nostalgic lineup too.\n\nDigitalWatcher101:\n\nGuess the positive feedback they received (and maybe our confusion over the \"technical glitch\"?) prompted them to make the switch. It's awesome, but I have to agree about missing \"GoGoRiki\" and \"Sonic X.\" Hopefully, those shows will pop up on the schedule at some point or maybe even on a streaming service.\n\nNostalgiaNut45:\n\nHonestly, I celebrate the return of the classic lineup, but \"Sonic X\" not being there is more disappointing than I thought it would be. Still, let's enjoy what we have and keep voicing our support for those missing titles!\n\nAnimeFan93:\n\nAbsolutely, everyone. It's a mix of emotions, but overall, this return feels like a victory for nostalgia fans. Let's hope that with enough interest and support, we might see a more inclusive rotation that brings back \"Sonic X\" and \"GoGoRiki.\" For now, Saturdays are once again a portal to childhood for many of us. Let's keep the conversation going and maybe, just maybe, our combined voices will bring about even more positive changes!"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a follow up where they check the schedule for the next few weeks on their station, and the week later it appears permanent, (rip Pogoriki and Chikoriki)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thread Update: Classic KWB Lineup Seems Permanent, But at a Cost\n\nAnimeFan93:\n\nHello again, nostalgic warriors!\n\nThe past couple of weeks have been quite the rollercoaster for us fans of the classic Kids WB lineup on CW4Kids. Since my last update where I shared the exciting yet bittersweet return of our beloved KWB shows\u2014minus \u201cSmeshariki/GoGoRiki\u201d and \u201cSonic X\u201d\u2014I\u2019ve been closely monitoring the station's schedule, hoping for signs of what\u2019s to come.\n\nWell, it appears I have news: the classic KWB lineup seems to be cemented as the new (or should I say, returned) normal for the foreseeable future. I've checked the schedule for the next few weeks, and it consistently features the same set of shows that replaced the more recent CW4Kids programming. Sadly, there's no indication that \u201cSmeshariki/GoGoRiki\u201d or \u201cSonic X\u201d will be making a comeback, marking what seems to be a permanent removal (RIP Pogoriki and Chikoriki).\n\nHere\u2019s the confirmed lineup for the next several weeks:\n\n7:00 AM - Loonatics Unleashed\n7:30 AM - Xiaolin Showdown\n8:00 AM - Johnny Test\n8:30 AM - Legion of Super Heroes\n9:00 AM - The Batman\n9:30 AM - Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!\n10:00 AM - Tom and Jerry Tales\n10:30 AM - Monster Allergy\n11:00 AM - Spider Riders\n11:30 AM - Magi-Nation\n\nIt\u2019s a mixed bag of emotions. On one hand, the commitment to bringing back these classics is something many of us dreamed about but never truly believed would happen. On the other hand, the exclusion of \u201cSonic X\u201d and \u201cSmeshariki/GoGoRiki\u201d feels like a loss for fans who cherished those series as part of their childhood repertoire.\n\nToonLover105:\n\nIt\u2019s official then? That\u2019s incredible news for classic KWB fans! It does sting not seeing \"Sonic X\" in the lineup, though. Here\u2019s to hoping they\u2019ll still find a way to honor all parts of their legacy, including the shows we\u2019re missing now.\n\nRetroFan88:\n\nPermanent, huh? I guess it\u2019s time to celebrate the wins and mourn the losses. \u201cSonic X\u201d and \u201cSmeshariki/GoGoRiki\u201d will be missed, but seeing the rest of the KWB classics holding strong gives me hope. Maybe fan petitions or letters could sway them in the future?\n\nDigitalWatcher101:\n\nPermanent changes are always a bit of a double-edged sword, aren't they? Thrilled for the return of so many classics, but it\u2019s a shame about the ones left behind. Does anyone know if there\u2019s another place to catch \u201cSonic X\u201d or \u201cSmeshariki/GoGoRiki\u201d episodes?\n\nNostalgiaNut45:\n\nI\u2019m over the moon that the KWB lineup is back for good, but definitely feeling a pinch for \u201cSonic X\u201d and \u201cSmeshariki.\u201d They were such a big part of what made Saturday mornings special. Let\u2019s not lose hope, though. Channels change, but fan demand can bring shows back from the vault!\n\nAnimeFan93:\n\nYour optimism and passion are what make this community amazing, everyone. While we enjoy the return of many KWB classics, let\u2019s also keep the memory and love for \u201cSonic X\u201d and \u201cSmeshariki/GoGoRiki\u201d alive in our discussions and fan efforts.

Here are the five most watched shows in mid-September:\n\n1. **\u201cYu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds\u201d**: Racing to the top of the viewer charts, \u201cYu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds\u201d has captivated audiences with its combination of high-speed Turbo Duels, compelling narrative, and the ever-popular Yu-Gi-Oh! card game. Yusei Fudo's quest to become the best and his battles against the Dark Signers have resonated with fans, making it the most-watched show.\n\n2. **\u201cThe Spectacular Spider-Man\u201d**: Swinging into second place, \u201cThe Spectacular Spider-Man\u201d continues to thrill audiences with Spider-Man\u2019s heroic deeds and Peter Parker's personal dilemmas. The engaging stories, coupled with classic and new villains, prove that Spider-Man remains a beloved character among CW4Kids watchers.\n\n3. **\u201cWinx Club\u201d**: Magic and fairy adventures captivate the third spot with \u201cWinx Club.\u201d The series\u2019 blend of fantasy, action, and the trials of growing up enchant viewers, highlighting the universal appeal of the Winx fairies and their journeys through the magical universe.\n\n4. **\u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fast Forward\u201d**: The futuristic adventure of the Ninja Turtles has garnered considerable attention, making it the fourth most watched show. The fresh setting and new characters, alongside the timeless appeal of the TMNT franchise, have attracted a wide range of viewers eager for action-packed storytelling.\n\n5. **\u201cDinosaur King\u201d**: Rounding out the top five, \u201cDinosaur King\u201d has roared its way into the hearts of viewers. The combination of dinosaur battles, adventure, and the quest to protect the world from evil has proven to be a hit, especially among younger audiences fascinated by prehistoric creatures.\n\nThis mid-September snapshot reflects the diverse tastes of CW4Kids audiences, from the action and adventure of superheroes and mystical creatures to the strategic battles of card games. The rankings also suggest a successful integration of new and returning series into the lineup, appealing to both loyal fans and attracting new viewers."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a Top 3 with the lighter hearted shows"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mid-September has shown that among the dynamic and action-packed lineup of CW4Kids, there's a significant audience appreciation for the lighter-hearted, more comedic, or whimsically themed shows. These series provide a delightful contrast to the high-octane adventures, showcasing the broad appeal of the programming. Here are the top 3 lighter-hearted shows that have captured the hearts of viewers:\n\n1. **\u201cKikoriki\u201d**: Climbing to the top of our lighter-hearted category, \u201cKikoriki\u201d has proven to be a massive hit. Its appeal lies in the humorous and sometimes absurd adventures of its round, colorful characters who, despite their simplicity, delve into complex life lessons about friendship, creativity, and problem-solving. The whimsical world of \u201cKikoriki,\u201d devoid of any real villain but full of challenges and learning opportunities, resonates with audiences looking for lighthearted entertainment with depth.\n\n2. **\u201cJohnny Test\u201d**: Always a crowd-pleaser, \u201cJohnny Test\u201d secures the second spot with its blend of slapstick humor, science fiction, and the everyday trials of being a kid. Johnny's misadventures, often instigated by his genius twin sisters' inventions, deliver a mix of chaos, comedy, and heart. It\u2019s the quintessential story of a boy and his (talking) dog facing the world, one experiment at a time, appealing to viewers who enjoy comedic antics mixed with a dash of action.\n\n3. **\u201cWinx Club\u201d**: While \u201cWinx Club\u201d is deeply rooted in the magical girl genre and features its share of battles and villains, it also shines with its lighter moments of friendship, romance, and personal growth, earning it the third spot. The series appeals to those who enjoy a good dose of fantasy and whimsy alongside their action, making it a unique blend that offers heartwarming stories, humor, and the power of teamwork and understanding. The daily lives of the fairies at Alfea, their interactions, and the lighter, comedic moments amidst their adventures provide a comforting escape with valuable lessons in resilience and kindness.\n\nThese top 3 lighter-hearted shows within the CW4Kids lineup demonstrate the network's commitment to providing a range of content that can entertain, enlighten, and engage audiences of all ages, showcasing the power of storytelling that brings joy, laughter, and a sense of wonder."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a tweet saying Johnny Test officially stopped using the Season 1 intro on September 13, and moved to the one that's already been in use in Canada for ages, "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\ud83d\udea8 Big news, #JohnnyTest fans! \ud83d\udea8 Starting September 13, the show has bid farewell to the Season 1 intro and embraced the catchy tune that's been rocking Canada for ages! \ud83c\udfb8\ud83d\udd25 Get ready for a fresh vibe with each adventure! \ud83c\udf1f #NewIntro #ExcitingChange #JohnnyTestUpdate \ud83d\udcfa\u2728"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a forum convo saying one show could have stayed, but instead they're double running Johnny Test"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "User1: Did anyone catch the latest schedule update?

Hopefully, they\u2019re looking at bringing in some fresh content soon to mix things up a bit.\n\nUser7: I wonder what the rationale was. Johnny Test has its charm, but a double run seems overkill. Do you think they\u2019re testing the waters for increased viewership in that time slot, or maybe it\u2019s just a temporary fill?\n\nUser8: Could be a bit of both.

What\u2019s up with that?\n\n---\n\n**LoudHouseLover21**: Yeah, I noticed that too! I'm kinda bummed about **Danny Phantom** and **Avatar** being replaced, those were my go-to shows after school. The Monster Block sounds interesting though, haven't seen **Monster Allergy** in ages. But I\u2019ll miss my daily Avatar fix for sure.\n\n---\n\n**PokeMaster98**: Did anyone catch that **Pokemon Advanced** is replacing **XYZ** next week? They keep switching these up. I was really getting into the XYZ series. Hopefully, Advanced will be just as good. At least the SpongeBob and Loud House mix is still the same.\n\n---\n\n**MonsterManiax**: Totally psyched for the Monster Block! **AAHH! Real Monsters** is a classic, and I\u2019ve been a **Monster High** fan for years. It's a nice switch-up, but I do get why some might miss the old lineup. Variety is the spice of life, though, right?\n\n---\n\n**NickNostalgia**: Can't believe they're sidelining **Danny Phantom** and **Avatar**. Those are some seriously iconic shows. The Monster Block could be cool for a bit, but I hope they bring back the classics soon. Also, mixing in more Pok\u00e9mon never hurts, but the constant series switching is a bit much.\n\n---\n\n**AvatarAangFan**: This is really disappointing. Replacing **Avatar**? That show has such a strong fan base and it\u2019s timeless. I understand trying out new themes like the Monster Block, but Avatar should be a staple!

It\u2019s perfect for the Halloween season if they decide to keep it around for a bit. Plus, **Monster High** has a lot of fans that will be thrilled. **Monster Allergy** is an underrated gem too. Still, the absence of **Danny Phantom** seems like a missed opportunity during a monster-themed block.\n\n---\n\n**Pikachu4Ever**: Welp, there goes my daily XYZ binge. **Pokemon Advanced** is okay, but XYZ had some epic battles. Hope Advanced has some good stuff too. At least **SpongeBob** and **The Loud House** are untouched. They kinda act as the backbone for Nicktoons' schedule anyway.\n\n---\n\n**DannyPhanatic**: Removing **Danny Phantom** just when I thought there was a resurgence in interest... Not cool, Nicktoons UK, not cool. He's practically a monster-fighting hero himself. Would've fit right in with the block.

Strange decision. **My Dad the Rockstar** has its charm, but feels off for the late-night vibe **Grizzly Tales** offered.\n\n---\n\n**GrizzlyGuru**: Disappointed but not surprised. **Grizzly Tales** always felt like a show that was underappreciated, thrown in to check a box rather than celebrated for its storytelling. Here\u2019s hoping it finds its way back to a more prominent slot. As for **My Dad the Rockstar**, might give it a shot; who knows? It could grow on me.\n\n---\n\n**RockRevival**: TBH, **My Dad the Rockstar** returning is a win for me. I miss shows that aren\u2019t afraid to be a little weird and wild. This might not be the popular opinion, but let\u2019s give it a chance before we write it off completely for not being Pok\u00e9mon or **Monster Allergy**.\n\n---\n\n**Thread Moderator**: This thread is lively! Good to see so many passionate opinions. Remember, the TV landscape is always changing, and who knows what the future holds?

By cleverly packaging **MA** with thematic shows, they\u2019re not just trying to boost its viewership but also enhancing the overall viewing experience. It\u2019s a smart way to capitalize on monster mania, inviting viewers to dive deeper into that world.\n\n---\n\n**MonsterHighway**: Love or hate the strategy, it\u2019s definitely got people talking about **MA** more.

There\u2019s been a lot of speculation about scheduling and programming strategies, particularly regarding shows like **Aaahh!!! Real Monsters (ARM)**. Can you shed any light on this?\n\n**CEO:** Absolutely, and thank you for having me. There has been a lot of discussion recently, and I'd like to clarify our stance and thought process behind these decisions. Our programming strategy, particularly with the integration of shows like **ARM** and its pairing with **Monster High (MH)** and **Monster Allergy (MA)**, was indeed designed with a specific purpose in mind.\n\n**Interviewer:** There\u2019s been talk that **ARM**\u2019s reintroduction was primarily to support **MA**, especially after **Horrid Henry** was no longer part of the lineup. Can you confirm this?\n\n**CEO:** I can confirm that. When we lost **Horrid Henry**, it created a gap that we needed to fill. **MA** has a strong potential, and we saw an opportunity to create a themed block that could not only support **MA** but also reintroduce viewers to **ARM**. It was a strategic move intended to bolster the ratings for **MA** and provide a cohesive viewing experience that capitalized on the popular monster theme.\n\n**Interviewer:** So, does this mean that **ARM** is likely to be phased out again soon?\n\n**CEO:** While I wouldn't say \"phased out,\" our programming is always under review to ensure it meets the viewers' interests and our strategic goals. **ARM**\u2019s current run is tied to the performance and reception of this themed block. We are always exploring new content and partnerships to keep our lineup fresh and engaging. If something more aligned with our audience's preferences and our strategic direction emerges, we might adjust our schedules accordingly.\n\n**Interviewer:** Understanding that, is there a search for a new popular third-party show to join the lineup?\n\n**CEO:** Indeed, there\u2019s always a search for exciting content that can resonate with our audience. Our goal is to provide a diverse range of programming that entertains and engages our viewers. While I can\u2019t dive into specifics at this stage, I assure you that several discussions are in progress to bring new and thrilling content to our channels.\n\n**Interviewer:** How do you balance between popular international content and the need to fulfill independent content quotas?\n\n**CEO:** It's a careful balancing act. We're committed to supporting independent productions and fulfilling our quotas, as it's essential for the diversity of content and supporting the local industry. At the same time, we understand our audience has a broad range of interests, including international hit shows. Our strategy involves striking a balance that satisfies these requirements while ensuring a varied and interesting lineup for our viewers.\n\n**Interviewer:** Finally, can you give us a hint about future plans for the channels?\n\n**CEO:** Without revealing too much, I can say we\u2019re excited about what\u2019s on the horizon. We're looking into more theme-based blocks, similar to the monster theme, and are in talks for new series that have the potential to become viewer favorites. We\u2019re also examining ways to bring more interactive and immersive experiences to our audience. So, stay tuned!\n\n**Interviewer:** Thank you for your time and the insight into the channel's strategies and outlook.

Nickelodeon UK, a staple in quality children\u2019s entertainment, is no stranger to adapting its programming to meet the rapidly changing interests of its young audience. A recent development has seen the channel preparing to pivot away from one of its most iconic offerings, \"Pok\u00e9mon,\" despite having two years remaining on its contract. This move has sparked speculation and a buzz of anticipation about what might come next.\n\n#### The Pok\u00e9mon Phenomenon\n\nFor decades, \"Pok\u00e9mon\" has been a cornerstone of children's television, capturing the imagination of millions around the globe. Its success lies in its captivating stories, endearing characters, and the universal appeal of its \"Gotta Catch 'Em All!\" mantra. Nickelodeon UK's decision to start distancing itself from the Pok\u00e9mon franchise thus comes as a surprise to many fans who have grown up with Ash, Pikachu, and the countless adventures across the Pok\u00e9mon world.\n\n#### A Strategic Evolution\n\nInsiders suggest that this shift is a strategic response to the changing landscape of children's media consumption. With the rise of streaming services and on-demand viewing, traditional TV channels are challenged to offer content that can not only compete with the vast libraries available online but also cater to the new interests emerging from this digital age.\n\nMoreover, Nickelodeon UK\u2019s intensive push of Pok\u00e9mon-themed content, including making it the theme for their next pop-up channel, may be a move to maximize the franchise's potential while it's still part of their repertoire. This \"Pok\u00e9Blitz\" could very well be a celebration of the franchise\u2019s legacy on the channel, giving it the send-off it deserves.\n\n#### Looking Ahead: What's Next for Nickelodeon UK\n\nThe impending post-Pok\u00e9mon era for Nickelodeon UK points to a future where the channel is placing bets on new and possibly original content to fill the void. Recent trends show a leaning towards themes and genres that resonate with today\u2019s kids, who are more in tune with social media trends and global issues than any generation before them.\n\nSpeculation is rife about potential replacements. There's a strong case for more interactive and educational content, shows with environmental messages, or even series that incorporate technology and coding\u2014skills that are becoming ever more important in today's digital world. Nickelodeon's recent pop-up ventures, such as \"NickTooniverse,\" show a willingness to experiment and innovate, suggesting that whatever comes next will be both fresh and forward-thinking.\n\n#### Embracing Change\n\nChange can often be met with trepidation, but it is also a doorway to new opportunities. For Nickelodeon UK, moving on from Pok\u00e9mon is a bold step into uncharted territory. It's a chance to redefine what children's programming can be and, in doing so, remain a leader in an industry that never stops moving.\n\nFor fans, while the prospect of losing a beloved franchise might be bittersweet, there's also the excitement of discovering new worlds and characters to fall in love with. Nickelodeon UK's journey beyond Pok\u00e9mon promises to be one worth watching.\n\nIn conclusion, as we say goodbye to the familiar faces of Ash and Pikachu, let\u2019s stay tuned to see how Nickelodeon UK will continue to innovate and entertain the next generation of viewers. The Pok\u00e9mon legacy will undoubtedly be a hard act to follow, but if anyone's up to the task, it's Nickelodeon UK."}]}, {"facetValue": "The user engaged in a detailed discussion about television schedules and show replacements, expressing a range of opinions and reactions.

Looks like Bunsen is a Beast, Danny Phantom, and Avatar have been replaced. Now there\u2019s a whole Monster Block with Monster High, AAHH! Real Monsters, and Monster Allergy. What\u2019s up with that?\n\n\u2014\n\nLoudHouseLover21: Yeah, I noticed that too! I\u2019m kinda bummed about Danny Phantom and Avatar being replaced, those were my go-to shows after school. The Monster Block sounds interesting though, haven\u2019t seen Monster Allergy in ages. But I\u2019ll miss my daily Avatar fix for sure.\n\n\u2014\n\nPokeMaster98: Did anyone catch that Pokemon Advanced is replacing XYZ next week? They keep switching these up. I was really getting into the XYZ series. Hopefully, Advanced will be just as good. At least the SpongeBob and Loud House mix is still the same.\n\n\u2014\n\nMonsterManiax: Totally psyched for the Monster Block! AAHH! Real Monsters is a classic, and I\u2019ve been a Monster High fan for years. It\u2019s a nice switch-up, but I do get why some might miss the old lineup. Variety is the spice of life, though, right?\n\n\u2014\n\nNickNostalgia: Can\u2019t believe they\u2019re sidelining Danny Phantom and Avatar. Those are some seriously iconic shows. The Monster Block could be cool for a bit, but I hope they bring back the classics soon. Also, mixing in more Pok\u00e9mon never hurts, but the constant series switching is a bit much.\n\n\u2014\n\nAvatarAangFan: This is really disappointing. Replacing Avatar? That show has such a strong fan base and it\u2019s timeless. I understand trying out new themes like the Monster Block, but Avatar should be a staple! Guess it\u2019s time to dust off the old DVDs.\n\n\u2014\n\nGhoulGirl: Honestly, I\u2019m here for the Monster Block! It\u2019s perfect for the Halloween season if they decide to keep it around for a bit. Plus, Monster High has a lot of fans that will be thrilled. Monster Allergy is an underrated gem too. Still, the absence of Danny Phantom seems like a missed opportunity during a monster-themed block.\n\n\u2014\n\nPikachu4Ever: Welp, there goes my daily XYZ binge. Pokemon Advanced is okay, but XYZ had some epic battles. Hope Advanced has some good stuff too. At least SpongeBob and The Loud House are untouched. They kinda act as the backbone for Nicktoons\u2019 schedule anyway.\n\n\u2014\n\nDannyPhanatic: Removing Danny Phantom just when I thought there was a resurgence in interest\u2026 Not cool, Nicktoons UK, not cool. He\u2019s practically a monster-fighting hero himself. Would\u2019ve fit right in with the block. Guess I\u2019ll have to stick to fan communities for my ghost boy fix.\n\n\u2014\n\nRealMonstersFan: Finally, AAHH! Real Monsters is getting the love it deserves! That show was way ahead of its time. Sad to see some favorites go, but this does shake things up. Maybe it\u2019ll introduce these classics to a new audience.

My Dad the Rockstar Takes Over!\n\n\u2014\n\nTalesOfTerror: Did anyone else notice Grizzly Tales got slashed in half on the late-night roster? I thought it was a solid choice for those looking to enjoy something a bit different. Now it\u2019s just to fill those independent quotas since it\u2019s from Honeycomb Animation and aired on CITV. Replaced by My Dad the Rockstar? Was expecting more Pok\u00e9mon or even Monster Allergy to take its place. Thoughts?\n\n\u2014\n\nRockstarRiffs: Honestly didn\u2019t expect My Dad the Rockstar to make a comeback, especially not at the expense of Grizzly Tales. I\u2019ve got nothing against it, but the shift is\u2026unexpected. Thought they\u2019d double down on Pok\u00e9mon or something more in line with current trends.\n\n\u2014\n\nAnimationAdvocate: It\u2019s a shame to see Grizzly Tales pushed back. I get the vibe they\u2019re only keeping it to meet quotas, which feels a tad disrespectful to the show. As for My Dad the Rockstar, it\u2019s an interesting choice. Maybe it\u2019s a play for nostalgia?\n\n\u2014\n\nQuotaConundrum: Let\u2019s face facts, folks. Filling quotas is a big part of scheduling decisions, and Grizzly Tales fits that niche for them. My Dad the Rockstar coming in might just be their way of shaking things up. Perhaps it tested well in groups we\u2019re not aware of?\n\n\u2014\n\nLateNightLurker: Grizzly Tales was my late-night guilty pleasure! \u2639\ufe0f The eerie vibe was perfect right before bed. My Dad the Rockstar is okay, but it doesn\u2019t hit the same spot. Seems like a weird choice to replace something so unique.\n\n\u2014\n\nNostalgiaKnight: Wait, people are upset about My Dad the Rockstar? I loved that show! Sure, it\u2019s sad about Grizzly Tales, but isn\u2019t variety the spice of life? Maybe they\u2019re just trying to appeal to a broader audience at the late-night slot.\n\n\u2014\n\nMonsterAllergyFan: Really thought they\u2019d pick Monster Allergy to replace it, considering the Monster Block and all. Strange decision. My Dad the Rockstar has its charm, but feels off for the late-night vibe Grizzly Tales offered.\n\n\u2014\n\nGrizzlyGuru: Disappointed but not surprised. Grizzly Tales always felt like a show that was underappreciated, thrown in to check a box rather than celebrated for its storytelling. Here\u2019s hoping it finds its way back to a more prominent slot. As for My Dad the Rockstar, might give it a shot; who knows? It could grow on me.\n\n\u2014\n\nRockRevival: TBH, My Dad the Rockstar returning is a win for me. I miss shows that aren\u2019t afraid to be a little weird and wild. This might not be the popular opinion, but let\u2019s give it a chance before we write it off completely for not being Pok\u00e9mon or Monster Allergy.\n\n\u2014\n\nThread Moderator: This thread is lively! Good to see so many passionate opinions. Remember, the TV landscape is always changing, and who knows what the future holds? Maybe Grizzly Tales will get more slots back or My Dad the Rockstar will become the next big hit.

Noticed they\u2019ve been trying to boost its popularity by pairing it up with other monster-themed shows. Even saw Aaahh!!! Real Monsters (ARM) got brought back into the mix. Think this will give MA the bump it needs?\n\n\u2014\n\nGarfieldFanatic: Honestly, it\u2019s a smart move but The Garfield Show has its own loyal audience because, well, it\u2019s Garfield. MA has its charm, but it\u2019s fighting an uphill battle. Monster mania is cool, but does it have what it takes to stand next to Pok\u00e9mon? Pairing it up with classics like ARM is clever, but only time will tell.\n\n\u2014\n\nPokeMasterX: Every show has its day, but Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s throne is pretty much untouchable. That said, MA has been getting more attention since the monster-themed programming kicked in. The pairings make for a fun, themed block that\u2019s been quite enjoyable. It certainly sets the right atmosphere for MA to thrive.\n\n\u2014\n\nAaahhFan: Thrilled to see ARM back in the lineup! If anything, I tune in for that nostalgia hit and stick around for MA. It\u2019s a fun show with a lot of potentials. This strategy could introduce it to new viewers who come for the monsters and stay for the story.\n\n\u2014\n\nAnimationAnalyst: The tactic here is pretty clear: they\u2019re attempting to create a monster universe of sorts to leverage the thematic continuity between shows. MA benefits from this association, particularly when paired with well-loved shows. It\u2019s a solid strategy for audience crossover but boosting it past The Garfield Show\u2014that\u2019s a tall order.\n\n\u2014\n\nMonsterKid2000: MA has always been underrated IMO. Pairing it with the likes of ARM just highlights what fans of monster genres enjoy. It\u2019s a smart play, and I\u2019ve definitely found myself watching more of it since the pairings started. Plus, who doesn\u2019t love a good monster mash-up?\n\n\u2014\n\nClassicToonLover: Is it just me, or have they been pushing MA really hard lately? I mean, I appreciate the effort to diversify, but I worry that forcing it into these blocks might deter some folks. It should stand on its own merits. That being said, the monster block has been entertaining.\n\n\u2014\n\nDigitalDuo: At the end of the day, it\u2019s all about content consumption. By cleverly packaging MA with thematic shows, they\u2019re not just trying to boost its viewership but also enhancing the overall viewing experience. It\u2019s a smart way to capitalize on monster mania, inviting viewers to dive deeper into that world.\n\n\u2014\n\nMonsterHighway: Love or hate the strategy, it\u2019s definitely got people talking about MA more. Plus, seeing ARM again is a total bonus. There\u2019s a certain genius in revitalizing interest in monster themes this way. MA might just surprise us and climb up the ranks.\n\n\u2014\n\nThread Moderator: Interesting points all around! It\u2019s great to see such varied perspectives on the network\u2019s strategy with Monster Allergy and its pairing with other monster-centric shows. This could indeed be the beginning of a new era for monster-themed programming. Let\u2019s keep the conversation respectful and see how this monster block evolves!

Just read that the Monster Block is officially closing down. Monster High (MH) is heading back to regular Nick, and Aaahh!!! Real Monsters (ARM) is moving to Paramount+ exclusively. Interestingly, Monster Allergy (MA) seems to be the sole survivor, not just staying put but also taking over TMNT Fast Forward\u2019s slot next week. Looks like MA is gaining some serious traction. Thoughts?\n\n\u2014\n\nTMNTfan1987: This is bittersweet. Sad to see TMNT Fast Forward replaced, but it\u2019s intriguing that MA is the one taking up the mantle. This show\u2019s been quite the dark horse, huh? Must say, its popularity seems to be skyrocketing. Curious to see how this will play out.\n\n\u2014\n\nDigitalStreamer: So, ARM is a Paramount+ exclusive now. This seems like a move to bolster their streaming content with proven fan-favorite titles. As for MH moving back to regular Nick, seems like a strategic repositioning. MA\u2019s success must be really turning heads for it to snag more prime slots.\n\n\u2014\n\nMonsterMashup: Honestly, MA\u2019s strong performance is a testament to its quality and the network's strategy in pushing monster-themed content. While I\u2019ll miss the variety the Monster Block offered, it\u2019s exciting to see one of the underdogs getting its well-deserved spotlight.\n\n\u2014\n\nNickNostalgic: It's always a rollercoaster with these schedules, isn't it? Moving MH and ARM feels like they're banking a lot on MA. With its place confirmed in the lineup, replacing even TMNT, MA's got a lot to live up to. Excited yet cautious about these changes.\n\n\u2014\n\nGarfieldGuru: Wasn't expecting MA to be the last monster standing. The shift back to regular Nick for MH and ARM becoming a streaming exclusive is a sign of the times, I guess. Content is moving fluidly between platforms. MA really needs to capitalize on this opportunity now.\n\n\u2014\n\nPokeMaster98: While MA stepping up is cool and all, I was really hoping the Monster Block would bring about a new era of dedicated themed programming. It's a shame to see it dismantle so soon. At least MA seems to be thriving, which is a win for its fans.\n\n\u2014\n\nAnimationAdmirer: The landscape of TV and streaming is indeed evolving. MA taking over TMNT\u2019s slot is huge, signaling a shift in viewer interests or at least in network strategy. Curious to see if MA will become as iconic as its predecessors.\n\n\u2014\n\nMonsterHighLover: Mixed feelings here. Happy for MA but sad to see MH being shuffled back to regular Nick, and ARM to Paramount+. The dynamics of where and how we watch our favorite shows are certainly changing. MA\u2019s success represents a bold new direction for the network.\n\n\u2014\n\nThread Moderator: This shift surely marks an interesting turn in the ongoing saga of our favorite shows and how they're presented to us. Whether it's the end of an era or the start of a new chapter, it\u2019s the fans who keep these shows alive with their enthusiasm and support. Let\u2019s watch closely as MA steps up to its new role in the lineup.

Monster Allergy taking over the prime slot is huge; the network must be banking heavily on its success. Hope it lives up to the hype!\n\n\u2014\n\nGarfieldGuru: Kinda loving that Monster Allergy is getting so much attention. Zick joining the ranks of iconic characters like Garfield on the Sky banner is something I didn\u2019t see coming this quickly. This boost in visibility might just introduce MA to audiences who've missed out so far.\n\n\u2014\n\nAnimationAnalyst: It's intriguing to see how networks maneuver their assets to adapt to viewer trends and demands. Zick's prominence is a calculated move, possibly aiming to fill the void left by other series. The creative ads add a touch of class to the transition. Curious to see how the viewership adjusts come May 1st.\n\n\u2014\n\nThread Moderator: The end of the Monster Block and the rise of Monster Allergy mark a pivotal moment in children's television programming. Zick's ascension to the Sky on-demand banner cements his place among animated nobility. As one chapter closes with heartfelt goodbyes, another awaits with untold adventures.

I get that channels need to refresh their lineups now and then, but it's been tough on the little one. We've found some solace in Squish, Horrid Henry, and The Owl & Co, which have been fantastic in their own right, but it's just not the same. It's adorable yet heartbreaking how they frequently ask if Kikoriki will ever come back. Has anyone else's kid been in a similar boat? How are you folks managing?\n\n**Reply by:** ParentingInToonTown\n\nAbsolutely understand where you're coming from, CartoonLover1990. My two are the same - we've transitioned well enough to the new shows, and they adore The Owl & Co, but Kikoriki held a special place. It was a uniquely charming show. I've tried finding some episodes online and setting up little 'nostalgia' viewings at home to ease the transition. Maybe that could work for you?\n\n**Reply by:** NostalgicNick\n\nFeeling the Kikoriki blues here too! Although, not a parent, but I grew up with Kikoriki and was sad to see it go from CartoonLand's lineup. It's interesting how certain cartoons, even the less mainstream ones, can leave such a lasting impact. On the bright side, it's given me an excuse to dive into other similar shows for that nostalgic kick. \n\n**Reply by:** ToonParent101\n\nCartoonLover1990, you're not alone. My youngest had a similar phase when CartoonLand phased out Dude, That's My Ghost. What really helped us was getting engaged with the newer shows, like you mentioned - Squish, Horrid Henry, and The Owl & Co. But they occasionally still ask for the ones that are gone. Sometimes introducing them to completely different activities (like drawing or outdoor play) when they bring up missing Kikoriki helps divert their attention and lessen the asking over time.\n\n**Reply by:** Tech savvy Dad\n\nHey, all! A bit off the beaten path, but I took to compiling playlists of similar shows and even found some Kikoriki episodes and clips online. Creating a media library for easy access helped keep the fond memories of Kikoriki alive while gradually welcoming new favorites into the fold. Sometimes blending old and new keeps everyone happy - or at least wards off the \"When is Kikoriki coming back?\" questions for a little while longer!\n\n**Post by:** CartoonLover1990\n\nThank you all for your thoughtful responses and suggestions! It's comforting to know we're not alone in this transition period. I appreciate the idea of creating nostalgia viewings and blending the old with the new. It's about making new happy memories while cherishing the old ones, right? Gonna start looking up some episodes online and planning a fun viewing party.

My kid's current favorites on CartoonLand are Chaotic, Skatoony, Johnny Test (though only Season 1 is on, they just can't get enough of it!), and YooHoo and Friends. It's great to see them so engaged with these shows, but they can't help missing Kikoriki. And, oh, the \"show with the orange blob\" \u2013 they meant Lamput, and now I realize how much of a staple it had become in our household.\n\nIt's fascinating to see what sticks with them and what becomes a fleeting memory. I\u2019m trying to find ways to keep these shows alive in our daily routines, maybe through drawing characters or storytelling, but I\u2019d love more ideas or to hear if any of you are dealing with similar nostalgic requests from your little ones!\n\n**Reply by:** RetroToonRanger\n\nTotally understand where you're coming from, ToonMixMaster! Lamput and Kikoriki have such unique premises and memorable characters; it's hard to find anything quite like them airing nowadays. Since you\u2019re seeking ideas, maybe try some DIY crafts based on these shows? There are tutorials online for creating simple animations or even clay models. It could be a fun project to do together and help fill that void left by their absence on CartoonLand.\n\n**Reply by:** CartoonLover1990\n\nHey ToonMixMaster, we're in the same boat here. My little one loved Lamput\u2014the hilarity of that orange blob's escapades was unmatched. Since reading your post, I've been inspired to hunt down some episodes and clips online. Maybe you could do the same and have a special movie night featuring Kikoriki and Lamput? Also, creating a scrapbook with images or drawings from their favorite episodes could be a nice way to keep the memories of their beloved shows fresh.\n\n**Reply by:** TechSavvyParent\n\nI went through a similar phase with my kids. They were massive fans of both Kikoriki and Lamput. Not to mention, the current love affairs with Chaotic and Skatoony. What worked for us was creating a \"mixtape\" (well, a digital playlist) of their favorite episodes across these shows, including any online finds of Kikoriki and Lamput. It became a fun weekend ritual to watch together. It might not bring the shows back to CartoonLand, but it keeps the spirit alive at home.\n\n**Reply by:** AnimatedHeart\n\nYour kiddos have great taste, ToonMixMaster! Chaotic, Skatoony, and the others are classics in their own right. Missing Kikoriki and Lamput shows they've got a deep appreciation for good storytelling and fun characters. Have you thought about introducing them to comic books or graphic novels that have a similar vibe? Sometimes, new yet familiar storylines can help bridge the gap left by beloved shows. Plus, it's a great way to encourage reading and imagination!\n\n**Post by:** ToonMixMaster\n\nThank you all for your ideas and encouragement! I love the suggestions of creating a digital playlist and engaging in some arts and crafts. The comic book or graphic novel idea sounds like a fantastic way to keep their imaginations fueled and maybe ease the longing for Kikoriki and Lamput a bit.

I was curious how your kids reacted and how you're managing their questions. \n\n**Reply 1 by AnimationAdmirer:**\n\nYes! We're in the same boat. My two were baffled when *Lamput* was nowhere to be found. My youngest actually thought our TV was broken and wanted to help \"fix\" it so Lamput could come back! It was both sweet and sad. I just told them maybe Lamput is on a super secret mission and we have to wait and see if he comes back.\n\n**Reply 2 by SciFiMom:**\n\nI've had a tough time explaining to my daughter. She thinks the scientists finally caught Lamput and got really upset about it. We've been drawing our own \"Lamput escapes\" comics to make up for it. It's our little coping mechanism, creating new adventures for Lamput until (or if) the show comes back.\n\n**Reply 3 by CartoonDad83:**\n\nIt's been a rollercoaster here too. My son asked if we could send a letter to the TV channel asking where Lamput went. So, we actually did.

On the bright side, it sparked his interest in writing and storytelling.\n\n**Reply 4 by GeekyGuardian:**\n\nOur reaction was a bit different. My kid shrugged and moved on to a new favorite show within days. Kids are resilient! Though, I must admit, *I* miss Lamput. It was one of the few shows we all enjoyed together. I\u2019ve been secretly hoping for its return or at least for an official statement about why it was removed.\n\n**Reply 5 by NostalgicNanny:**\n\nThis happened so suddenly! My granddaughter has been asking about Lamput every day. We've started making up our own stories about where Lamput could be, turning it into a fun bedtime story routine. It's our way of keeping the character alive in our home. I hope CartoonLand brings it back or at least gives us some closure.\n\n**Reply 6 by CalmCollector:**\n\nInteresting to see all the different reactions. It's a bummer when shows vanish without notice, more so for kids who form attachments to these characters.

It's been a few weeks since I started this thread, and I've witnessed a fascinating transition in my 8-year-old's viewing habits.\n\nAfter the initial sadness and repeated questions about why Lamput was gone, something unexpected happened. We stumbled upon three new shows that quickly captured my child's imagination, much to my surprise and relief.\n\n1. **\"Adventure Hunters\"**: A show filled with mysteries and exploration, which hooked him instantly. The vibrant characters and their endless quests for ancient artifacts around the world seem to have filled the adventurous gap left by Lamput.\n\n2. **\"Space Rascals\"**: This animated series about a group of mischievous kids exploring the galaxy in their spaceship introduced a whole new world of excitement. The sci-fi element added a fresh layer of intrigue and wonder that he absolutely loves.\n\n3. **\"Magicville\"**: A magical town with talking animals and mystical events at every turn. This show, in particular, has sparked not just an interest in magic but also in drawing and storytelling, as he now creates his own magical tales.\n\nSeeing this shift has been remarkable. While he occasionally mentions Lamput with a nostalgic tone, these three shows have largely filled the void and expanded his horizons. It's a testament to how resilient and adaptable children can be, finding new sources of joy and creativity.\n\nHas anyone else observed similar changes in their kids' viewing preferences?

We\u2019ve had a similar experience in our house. \"Space Rascals\" has been a hit here too! It's amazing how quickly kids can bounce back and find new interests. It makes me think that as much as they loved Lamput, it\u2019s the excitement of discovery and the joy of storytelling that really captivates them.\n\n**Reply 2 by GeekyGuardian:**\n\nThanks for sharing this! It really resonates with us. My child found a new love in \"Magicville\" as well, and it's been wonderful seeing her imagination run wild.

It's a lovely reminder that there\u2019s always something new that can capture their hearts and minds.\n\n**Reply 3 by AnimationAdmirer:**\n\nIncredible update, ToonWatcher101! \"Adventure Hunters\" has become my kids' new obsession.

However, this exciting influx of new programming comes with a bittersweet note for long-time fans. It\u2019s time to bid farewell to some beloved series, including \"Loonatics Unleashed,\" \"Xiaolin Showdown,\" and the cosmic adventures of \"MoonGoons.\" Additionally, classics like \"Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated\" and \"Tom and Jerry Tales\" are also exiting the lineup.\n\nWhile it's always hard to see favorites go, change is an inevitable part of the entertainment landscape, and it opens the door to fresh content and new fandoms. The departure of these shows makes room for series such as \"TMNT: Fast Forward,\" \"Chaotic,\" and \"Yu-Gi-Oh! GX,\" marking a new era for The CW4Kids with a heavier focus on action and strategy-based narratives.\n\n### What\u2019s Shifting?\n\nThe reshuffle doesn't stop with farewells and introductions.

This strategic move is designed to give these shows a fresh audience while accommodating the slate of new programming designed to captivate and engage viewers like never before.\n\n### Looking Forward\n\nChange, while often nostalgic, heralds an exciting time of growth and evolution.

With all the shake-ups happening on The CW4Kids schedule, I've been doing some heavy nostalgia-tripping lately. There are three shows I miss terribly: \"Xiaolin Showdown,\" \"MoonGoons,\" and \"Loonatics Unleashed.\" Each of them had something unique to offer, whether it was the epic quests of \"Xiaolin,\" the quirky adventures of \"MoonGoons,\" or the futuristic action of \"Loonatics.\" But apart from missing these gems, does anyone have info on when \"World of Quest\" is coming back? It kinda vanished in late April for some \"Xiaolin Showdown\" reruns, and I've been eagerly waiting for its return. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83c\udf0e\ud83d\udde1 Has anyone heard anything?\n\n**ToonSleuth**: @CartoonFan101, totally feel you on missing those classics! \"Xiaolin Showdown\" had some of the best showdowns that I remember rushing home from school to watch. Regarding \"World of Quest,\" no official word yet. There were rumors about schedule reshuffling because of the new shows coming in. It might be a while before we see our favorite warrior returning to action. \ud83d\ude1f\n\n**NostalgiaKnight**: Ah, \"Loonatics Unleashed\"... That show was ahead of its time! As for \"World of Quest,\" I've been scanning the networks for any news. Given The CW4Kids' history of spring surprises, I'm holding out hope we'll see it back by mid-summer. \ud83e\udd1e\n\n**RetroToonRaver**: Hey @CartoonFan101! It's tough seeing your favorites go. \"MoonGoons\" was such a unique concept; it really deserved more time to shine. About \"World of Quest,\" I'm right there with you. Those reruns of \"Xiaolin Showdown\" were a blast from the past but pushing \"WoQ\" off the schedule? Heartbreaking. I've got my fingers crossed that they're just making room for a big \"World of Quest\" return. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83d\ude80\n\n**CartoonFan101**: Thanks for the insights, everyone! It\u2019s comforting to know I\u2019m not alone in missing those shows. \"Xiaolin Showdown\" really did set the bar high for adventure cartoons. I guess all we can do is hope and keep our eyes peeled for any news regarding \"World of Quest.\" Here's to hoping our quest for \"World of Quest\" doesn't last too long! \ud83c\udf40\u2728 If anyone catches wind of its return, please be sure to shout it out here. Until then, I might dive into some good ol' reruns. Happy watching, everyone!"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a follow up where a user considers Loonatics to be \"Looney Tunes: Fast Forward\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**ToonConnoisseur**: Jumping back into the \"Loonatics Unleashed\" conversation a bit late, but I've been stewing over something. Is it just me, or can we essentially consider \"Loonatics Unleashed\" to be \"Looney Tunes: Fast Forward\"? \ud83e\udd14 Hear me out. The show, at its core, took our beloved Looney Tunes characters, reimagined them as their descendants in a futuristic setting, and threw them into high-octane adventures. It's like the creators took the essence and humor of the classic Looney Tunes, pumped it full of adrenaline, and launched it into the future.\n\n**RabbitSeason**: @ToonConnoisseur, that's an interesting take! I hadn't considered it that way, but now that you mention it, \"Loonatics Unleashed\" does feel like \"Looney Tunes: Fast Forward.\" It's like a love letter to the original series but adds a twist that appeals to both new viewers and long-time fans. Plus, the futuristic settings and tech-savvy storylines gave it a whole new dimension.\n\n**DaffyDuckFan**: LOL, \"Looney Tunes: Fast Forward,\" I like that! \ud83d\ude02 Honestly, @ToonConnoisseur, that makes a lot of sense. \"Loonatics Unleashed\" always felt like it had the spirit of the original Looney Tunes, even if the delivery was wildly different. The show took the slapstick and personality quirks of the originals and adapted them into superhero traits. If you squint a bit, it's not hard to see the connections.\n\n**ChuckJonesJr**: Interesting perspective, @ToonConnoisseur. I've always had mixed feelings about \"Loonatics Unleashed\" because of how different it was from the Looney Tunes I grew up with. But considering it as a \"Fast Forward\" version kind of helps reconcile that. It wasn't trying to replace the originals but rather offer a fresh, imaginative take. Maybe it\u2019s time for me to give it another chance with this new frame of mind.\n\n**ToonConnoisseur**: Yeah, @ChuckJonesJr, it's a balancing act of respecting the original while embracing the new. \"Loonatics Unleashed\" took bold steps, and while not everyone was on board initially, viewing it as a forward leap in the Looney Tunes timeline might make it more palatable for skeptics. I'm glad to see it's sparked some thought. Maybe it'll lead more fans to revisit the show with an open heart. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcab Let\u2019s keep the classics alive while welcoming new interpretations."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a follow up in late June where a user asks why they removed the MoonGoons, and say the show they kept over it, "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**MoonGoonsLover**: Hi everyone, I've been out of the loop for a bit and just saw the updated lineup for The CW4Kids in late June. Can someone tell me why they decided to remove \"MoonGoons\"? That show was incredibly creative, with Boofus and Diggle\u2019s adventures bringing something truly unique to Saturday mornings. It was both entertaining and had a beautiful way of teaching important life lessons through their cosmic journeys. What\u2019s puzzling me even more is the show they decided to keep over it. Why would they prioritize \u201cJohnny Test\u201d over \u201cMoonGoons\u201d? Don't get me wrong, I understand \u201cJohnny Test\u201d has its fans, but \u201cMoonGoons\u201d felt like it was in a league of its own, offering something different from the usual fare. Can anyone shed light on this decision?\n\n**ToonStrategist**: Hey @MoonGoonsLover! I share your disappointment. \"MoonGoons\" did have a special charm and brought a fresh perspective. The decision seems to have been influenced by ratings and possibly merchandise sales. \"Johnny Test\" has been a solid performer for years, with a built-in audience that consistently tunes in. Networks often have to make tough choices based on these metrics, even if it means cutting innovative shows that haven\u2019t yet built a comparable following.\n\n**AnimationAnalyst**: Adding to what @ToonStrategist mentioned, \"Johnny Test\" also has a broader international appeal and has been syndicated in multiple countries, making it a safer bet financially for the network. \"MoonGoons,\" while unique and beloved by its fans, may not have reached the same level of global recognition, affecting its perceived value to the network's lineup. It\u2019s a tough reality of the entertainment industry, where not all decisions can be based solely on creativity or quality.\n\n**ChildhoodRevisited**: This is such a bummer to hear! \ud83d\ude22 \u201cMoonGoons\u201d was literally the highlight of my Saturday mornings. \"Johnny Test\" is okay, but it feels like we've seen that formula before. I thought networks were about taking risks and bringing new ideas to the table. \u201cMoonGoons\u201d was exactly that\u2014a risk that paid off in terms of originality and depth. It\u2019s sad to see it go because of the so-called \u2018safe choices\u2019.\n\n**GalacticFan88**: It's really a loss for original storytelling in children's programming. \u201cMoonGoons\u201d had the potential to grow and evolve into something even bigger. I guess all we can do now is support the show in other ways, like online petitions or social media shout-outs, and hope the network notices. Sometimes they bring shows back when they see there's enough demand. Here\u2019s to hoping \u201cMoonGoons\u201d finds its way back to us or onto another platform where it can continue to shine!\n\n**MoonGoonsLover**: Thanks for the insights, everyone. It does shed some light on the situation, even if it\u2019s not the news I was hoping for. I agree that it might be worth rallying for its return. \u201cMoonGoons\u201d has a special place in many of our hearts, and who knows? Maybe with enough support, we can see our beloved characters, Boofus and Diggle, embark on new cosmic adventures once again.

I've been digging around for some explanations about the \"MoonGoons\" removal and stumbled upon something intriguing. Looks like \"GoGoRiki\" is slated to hit The CW4Kids lineup this Fall. For those unaware, \"GoGoRiki\" features a cast of round, animal characters living out comedic and moral-driven storylines, somewhat reminiscent of \"MoonGoons'\" own round, adventurous creatures. \n\nIt leads me to speculate: Could 4Kids have been wary of having two shows with visually similar premises? Given that \"Johnny Test\" has a significantly different vibe and style, they might have thought it safer to bank on that diversity leading up to \"GoGoRiki's\" debut. They could be betting on viewers focusing on \"Johnny Test\" in the interim, hoping any affection for \"MoonGoons\" fades, thus avoiding any potential confusion or competition between the two when \"GoGoRiki\" launches.\n\n**ArtAndToons**: That's a fascinating theory, @CinemaSavvy2023! It definitely makes sense from a branding standpoint. \"GoGoRiki\" and \"MoonGoons\" sharing similar aesthetic characteristics could indeed create a dilemma for 4Kids concerning their show lineup. Unfortunately, this strategy might underappreciate the viewer's ability to distinguish and enjoy multiple shows of a similar style, especially if they offer unique stories and characters. Though, in the world of network programming decisions, sometimes it's all about playing it safe and avoiding direct overlaps.\n\n**TellyTales**: While I see the logic, it\u2019s still a shame that \"MoonGoons\" had to be a casualty of such strategy. @CinemaSavvy2023\u2019s point does paint the broader picture of 4Kids' programming decisions. I\u2019m excited for \"GoGoRiki\" but saddened that it potentially came at the expense of another beloved show. Show diversity is important, but so is giving shows a chance to flourish and win over their audience.\n\n**ViewerVanguard**: I agree with @ArtAndToons on the viewers' ability to enjoy shows with visually similar premises. Both \"GoGoRiki\" and \"MoonGoons\" could have coexisted, each appealing to viewers in different ways. It seems like an oversight to underestimate the audience's capacity for appreciation. However, 4Kids might have other data or considerations guiding their decisions. Hopefully, \"GoGoRiki\" receives a warm welcome while we find other ways to keep \"MoonGoons\" alive in our hearts and perhaps in other media forms.\n\n**NostalgicNavigator**: It's interesting to consider the strategic decisions behind the cartoon lineup changes. If \"GoGoRiki\" is indeed part of a preemptive move to streamline the theme of the shows, I hope it proves to be a worthy successor in terms of quality content. Still, \"MoonGoons\" had such a unique charm and potential for developing its universe and characters further.
