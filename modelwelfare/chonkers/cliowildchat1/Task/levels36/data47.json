It has since evolved and gained worldwide recognition as one of the most popular and influential music genres. Rap music features rhythmic speech or spoken rhymes delivered over a beat, often accompanied by various elements such as DJs, breakdancers, and graffiti artists, making it a cultural phenomenon beyond the music itself.\n\n1. Origins: Rap music has roots in African and Afro-Caribbean music traditions, such as the griots of West Africa \u2013 traveling poets and storytellers who shared oral histories through rhythmic performances. The influence of Jamaican sound system culture and the art of \"toasting\" \u2013 talking over instrumental tracks \u2013 was also crucial in the early development of rap music.\n\n2. The emergence of hip-hop: By the early 1970s, underprivileged youths in the Bronx started hosting block parties to escape the hardships of life in their neighborhood. DJs like Kool Herc and Afrika Bambaataa emerged as key figures who mixed popular funk and soul records, extending the instrumental portions called \"breaks\" by using multiple turntables. This allowed them to create a continuous beat for people to dance to \u2013 a style known as breakdancing.\n\n3. Birth of rap: During these parties, MCs (Master of Ceremonies) began to speak over the music, initially to keep the crowd engaged and later to deliver rhythmic rhymes and wordplay. This verbal performance is known as rapping. Pioneering rap groups like The Sugarhill Gang and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five gained popularity with the release of tracks like \"Rapper's Delight\" (1979) and \"The Message\" (1982), which brought hip-hop into the mainstream media.\n\n4. Golden Age (mid-1980s to early 1990s): This period saw great innovation in rap music, marked by complex lyricism, storytelling, and social commentary. East Coast hip-hop rose to prominence with artists like Run-DMC, Public Enemy, Boogie Down Productions, and Eric B. & Rakim. On the West Coast, groups like N.W.A. and Ice-T introduced \"gangsta rap,\" discussing crime, violence, and controversial themes, leading to widespread attention and debates on rap's influence on society.\n\n5. 1990s to early 2000s: Rap music continued to evolve, with diverse sub-genres and styles emerging. The East Coast-West Coast rivalry peaked with iconic artists like Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G., leading to tragic deaths and increased scrutiny on rap music. Concurrently, Southern rap gained prominence with the rise of OutKast, Scarface, and the Geto Boys, while the late 1990s saw artists like Jay-Z, Nas, and Eminem gain worldwide fame.\n\n6. 2000s to present: Rap music has continued to thrive, with artists like Kanye West, Lil Wayne, Drake, and Kendrick Lamar pushing the genre's boundaries and exploring new realms, such as a fusion with electronic, pop, and rock music. Additionally, independent and underground hip-hop scenes have flourished, giving rise to local and regional sub-genres and movements worldwide.\n\nIn conclusion, rap music has a rich and complex history, reflecting the diverse experiences and viewpoints of its creators. It remains a significant cultural force and continues to evolve, redefine boundaries, and contribute to social and political dialogue."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are turntables and what is breakdancing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Turntables are a type of musical device used by DJs (disc jockeys) to play, manipulate, and mix vinyl records. They consist of a revolving platter on which the record is placed, a tonearm and stylus to pick up the sound, and various controls for adjusting the speed and movement of the platter. Turntables are a crucial component of hip-hop and rap music culture, as they were utilized by early DJs to create beats and extended musical breaks for MCs to rap over and for dancers to perform to.\n\nBreakdancing, also known as breaking or b-boying/b-girling, is a form of street dance that emerged in the 1970s, primarily among African-American and Puerto Rican youths in the Bronx, New York City. It is closely associated with hip-hop culture and has become an integral part of it. Breakdancing is characterized by its acrobatic and athletic moves, which incorporate elements from several dance styles, including martial arts, gymnastics, and traditional dance forms.\n\nBreakdancing consists of four primary elements:\n\n1. Toprock: This refers to the stance and dance moves performed while standing, which often serve as an introduction to a breakdance routine.\n\n2. Downrock: Also known as footwork, downrock involves floor-based movement patterns executed using the hands and feet while maintaining a constant flow and rhythm.\n\n3. Power moves: These are the most dynamic and visually impressive moves in breakdancing, showcasing strength, agility, and control. Power moves often include spins, flips, and other acrobatic stunts performed in quick succession.\n\n4. Freezes: As the name suggests, a freeze is a pose or position held by the dancer for a moment, demonstrating balance, control, and strength. Freezes are usually performed at the end of a sequence of moves to create a visual punctuation or climax.\n\nBreakdancing has evolved over time and has become an internationally recognized form of dance, with numerous competitions, exhibitions, and performances taking place around the world."}]}, {"facetValue": "provide information about hip-hop and rap culture.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "gather information about a museum in Seattle that has exhibits on hip-hop and rap culture, including the specific raps that might be taught in the museum."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "provide information about hip-hop and rap culture."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "In a museum in Seattle, I listened to the music sweet dreams.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "It all started in the Bronx in the early '70s as a low-class subculture. The working-class New Yorkers plunged into a primitive and later, with the emergence of rap, an aggressive movement, then called hip-hop. How did it happen that after 50 years he acquired the prefix lo-fi and became the basis for calm background music popular among young people?\n\nThe prefix lo-fi, that is, low fidelity, implies the presence of extraneous noises, echoes, and distortions on the recording, that is, all those imperfections that disappeared from music with the development of technology. At the same time, the quality of listening left much to be desired, but there was a special charm in it. Perhaps it is this charm that has been prompting talented musicians to write music with deliberately poor quality for many years. Or maybe it's not about that at all. In any case, lo-fi is a genre that competes quite successfully with other areas in the battle for popularity. Lo-fi hip-hop, like a grandson who found old grandfather's things in the attic, back in fashion, becoming a representative of another era. The rustle of film, the soft crackle of vinyl, and other sound artifacts today perform a cosmetic role and serve one purpose - to create an atmosphere and aesthetics of retro. And in such an amazing place as the internet, which has become an ideal place for the existence of Lo-Fi.\n\nThe harshness of instruments, barely distinguishable percussion or beat strikes, technical noise, and distorted voice - you wouldn't believe it, but a decade and a half ago, many recorded their favorite music from players onto tape recorders built into ancient button phones. Or they heavily compressed files so that more would fit into the 15-megabyte memory. And they listened to these songs from the built-in speakers. The quality of listening at the same time left much to be desired, but there was a special charm in it.

She was trained in the art of combat from a young age and proved herself to be a formidable warrior. However, her father, the lord of the house, always wanted a son to inherit the family's name, and so Selene was forced to balance her duties as a lady with her passion for knighthood.\n\nDespite her gender, Lady Knight Selene's skills with the sword are unmatched. She is agile, quick-witted, and can anticipate her enemies' moves effortlessly. She is also a strategic thinker, often outsmarting her foes and turning the tide of battle in her favor. Her strength lies not just in her sword arm, but also in her empathy and compassion, which she uses to rally her troops and inspire those around her.\n\nSelene's primary flaw lies in her pride. She can be obstinate and unwilling to accept help, even when she is in over her head. This often makes her vulnerable in battle, and she has been captured and imprisoned a few times because of it. She also struggles with her identity as both a lady and a knight. She resents the societal expectations and pressures that have been placed on her, and it often leads to her feeling isolated and alone.\n\nDespite these flaws, Selene is respected and admired by many. She has a quick wit and a sharp tongue, and her sense of humor often breaks the tension in tense situations. Her kindness and generosity have earned her many allies, and she has become somewhat of a champion for the common folk.\n\nAs for her crush, Selene has always had a soft spot for her childhood friend, a fellow noble who also happens to be a skilled fighter. They have been friends for as long as she can remember, and their bond is strong. However, circumstances have kept them apart for years, and Selene worries that their relationship will never evolve beyond mere friendship."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Selene has a Yorkshire accent.
