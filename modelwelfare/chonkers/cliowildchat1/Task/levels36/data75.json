I'll see you then!\"// Call ends.\nCaller approximates a loose time range, but the agent puts down a firm time for the appointment. In these instances, the agent\u2019s statement trumps the caller's.\nExample - Caller: \"I can be there between 2:00 and 4:00.\" // Agent: \"I'll put you down for 3:00, and then if you show up a little earlier or later, that's fine.\"\nCaller agrees to an appointment with a specific date and time but plans to drop the vehicle off before the scheduled appointment.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need an oil change.\"// Agent: \"I will schedule you for 10:00 AM tomorrow.\"// Caller: \"Can I drop my car off before my appointment?\" // Agent: \"Yes, you can drop your car off any time, and just leave your keys in the drop box.\"// Caller: \"Great, thanks!\" // Call ends.\nCaller agrees to an approximate time within a 1 hour time range because they are able to be serviced at the time of arrival.\nA walk-in time within an hour range, for a vehicle that can be serviced immediately, should be considered a specific appointment time. This is true because, even if an appointment is not put on the schedule, the service shop has an expected arrival time for the caller and the service can be completed at that arrival time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need to get my brakes repaired. Do you have any openings today?\"// Agent: \"You can come in now if you'd like\"// Caller: \"Great! I'll be there in half an hour.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"My car is being towed there right now and should be there in about 20 minutes. Can it be looked at right away?\" // Agent: \"Yeah, that's no problem.

We'll be there at 4:00.\"\nOption 2.

However, a specific walk-in time with no specific service time cannot be considered a specific appointment, because the vehicle cannot be serviced immediately upon arrival. In the following example, the caller gives a specific arrival time, but the service time cannot be set for a specific time. Thus, it is a soft appointment time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need to get my car serviced as soon as possible.\" // Agent: \"We're all booked through the whole week.\" // Caller: \"Can I just come in and have my car serviced between other appointments?\" // Agent: \"You can come in and possibly have your car serviced if they have time, but we cannot guarantee a service time and you may be here for a few hours.\" // Caller: \"I'll just get there when you open tomorrow at 8:00, and I'll wait.\"\nCaller is having his or her vehicle towed in but no appointment time is guaranteed.\nReceptionist or agent tells the caller that no appointment is necessary, they can just show up.\nExample call - Caller: \"Can I get my tire rotated today?\" // Receptionist or agent: \"Absolutely. You don't need an appointment. Just come on in.\"// Caller acknowledges this and the call ends.\nThe time of the visit or walk-in is for a window of time that exceeds 1 hour.\nExample call - Caller: \"My check engine light is on and I'd like to come in to have it checked out.\" // Agent: \"No problem. Can you come in today? We have openings after 12pm\" // Caller: \"Yeah, I'll be there between 12:30 and 2:30.\" // Call ends.\nCaller agrees to drop off his or her vehicle for an unscheduled appointment time.\nExample call - Caller: \"Can I get my car in for service tomorrow?\" // Agent: \"What time do you need it done?\" // Caller: \"Anytime is fine. I'll just drop it off at 7:00 and leave it there for the day.\" // Agent: \"Great, we'll get it done before the end of the day.\"\nOption 3. Appointment requested / mentioned but not set\nCaller asked about a service appointment but did not agree to an appointment.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need to bring my car in for some routine service.\"// Receptionist or agent: \"We can fit you in tomorrow morning.\"// Caller: \"That won't work for me. I need to get it serviced today.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"I want to get my motor oil replaced. How much do you charge for that?\" // Price is provided and appointment requested. // Caller: \"Oh, that's too much. I'm not interested. Thanks.\"\nOption 4. No appointment, walk-in, or drop-off discussed\nCaller is asking about a service or there was an opportunity to book an appointment but no appointment, walk-in, or drop-off was discussed.\nExample call - Caller: \"Does your service department do oil changes?\"// Receptionist or agent: \"Yes\"// Caller: \"Thanks.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"I want to get my fluids flushed and replaced. How much do you charge for that?\" // Only the price is provided and NO potential appointment is mentioned. // Caller: \"Oh, that's too much. I\u2019m not interested. Thanks.\"\nOption 5. Upcoming scheduled appointment\nCaller discusses an existing appointment already scheduled for an upcoming time and/or date.\nCaller cancels or reschedules an appointment that was already scheduled for an upcoming time and/or date.\nOption 6. Vehicle already in service\nCaller discusses or asks about the status of a vehicle already in service.\nCaller adds services to a vehicle already in service.\nOption 7. No, not an appointment opportunity\nCall is general conversation, a personal call, or employee-to-employee conversation and no appointment opportunity exists.\nThe service requested is not offered by the dealership/shop/business.\nCaller asks if there are any recalls and is told there are no open recalls.\nCaller asks if vehicle is due for service and is told the vehicle is not due for service.\nCall is about parts only and there is no service mentioned.\nCaller is only discussing a bill without any discussion of services.\nCaller is only asking about a car wash without any discussion of services.\nCaller asks how to service something on their own and services are not needed from the service shop.\nExample: \"Can you tell me how to reset the code in my door panel?\" // Agent provides instructions over the phone. No appointment is requested/needed.\nCall is intended for the body shop. The body shop is a separate department from service.\nCall is intended for the collision center. The collision center is a separate department from service.\nOption 8.

Unscheduled walk-in or loose appointment time/range exceeding 1 hour:\nThe caller agrees on an unscheduled walk-in or provides a loose time range that's longer than 1 hour for a planned visit. There might be no guarantee for an exact appointment time, and callers might acknowledge first-come, first-served scenarios.\n\n3. Appointment requested/mentioned but not set:\nThe caller inquires about an appointment but doesn't confirm a specific appointment time. In this situation, the appointment is mentioned or requested, but no definitive plans are made.\n\n4. No appointment, walk-in, or drop-off discussed:\nThe conversation focuses on service-related inquiries, but there's no discussion regarding appointments, walk-ins, or vehicle drop-offs. It includes conversations about pricing, services available, and other related information without scheduling a visit.\n\n5. Upcoming scheduled appointment:\nThe caller discusses an existing appointment that has already been scheduled for an upcoming time and date. It may involve the caller rescheduling or canceling the appointment.\n\n6. Vehicle already in service:\nThe discussion concerns a vehicle already in service. Callers ask about the status of their vehicle, seek updates, or request additional services while their vehicle is in the service center.\n\n7. No appointment opportunity:\nConversations that don't present potential appointment opportunities fall into this category. These calls may involve general conversations, discussions about services not offered, inquiries about recalls or car washes, or billing issues without mentioning service requests.\n\n8.

We'll look at it as soon as it arrives.\"\nCaller agrees to an approximate time of \"around 1 hour\".\nCaller discusses an existing appointment and agrees to a new appointment during the same call.\nExample call - Caller: \"I'm checking on the status of my car that's in service, and I also wanted to know if I could bring my wife's car in for an oil change.\"// Agent: \"Your car is ready to be picked up, we can get your wife's car in at 4:00 if that time works for you.\"// Caller: \"That works. We'll be there at 4:00.\"\nOption 2. Unscheduled walk-in or loose appointment time / range exceeding 1 hour\nCaller gives a vague agreement to possibly come in.\nExample call - Caller: Do you have availability tomorrow morning. // Agent: \"Yes, we're pretty open all morning.\" // Caller: \"Okay, I may drop it off in the morning.\" // Call ends.\nCaller agrees to come in but approximates a time range that exceeds 1 hour.\nExample call - Caller: \"I'll be there in about 2 hours.\"\nCaller agrees to come in before or after a specific time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I can be there sometime before 4:00 PM.\"\nIn this example, the caller could be there anytime before 4:00, making this a loose appointment time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I won't be able to get there until after 5:00.\"\nIn this example, the caller could be there anytime after 5:00.\nReceptionist or agent tells the caller that it is first come, first served and the caller says \"OK.\"\nExample call - Caller: \"Do I need an appointment for an oil change?\"// Receptionist or agent: \"It is first come, first served.\"// Caller acknowledges this and the call ends.\nCaller agrees to be an unscheduled walk-in.\nExample call - Caller - \"Do you accept walk-ins?\" // Agent: \"We'll be accepting walk-ins all day Saturday.\" // Caller: \"I'll be there sometime Saturday then!\"\nCaller agrees to come in at a certain time but no appointment time is guaranteed.\nA walk-in time within an hour range, that can be serviced immediately, is a specific appointment time. However, a specific walk-in time with no specific service time cannot be considered a specific appointment, because the vehicle cannot be serviced immediately upon arrival. In the following example, the caller gives a specific arrival time, but the service time cannot be set for a specific time. Thus, it is a soft appointment time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need to get my car serviced as soon as possible.\" // Agent: \"We're all booked through the whole week.\" // Caller: \"Can I just come in and have my car serviced between other appointments?\" // Agent: \"You can come in and possibly have your car serviced if they have time, but we cannot guarantee a service time and you may be here for a few hours.\" // Caller: \"I'll just get there when you open tomorrow at 8:00, and I'll wait.\"\nCaller is having his or her vehicle towed in but no appointment time is guaranteed.\nReceptionist or agent tells the caller that no appointment is necessary, they can just show up.\nExample call - Caller: \"Can I get my tire rotated today?\" // Receptionist or agent: \"Absolutely. You don't need an appointment. Just come on in.\"// Caller acknowledges this and the call ends.\nThe time of the visit or walk-in is for a window of time that exceeds 1 hour.\nExample call - Caller: \"My check engine light is on and I'd like to come in to have it checked out.\" // Agent: \"No problem. Can you come in today? We have openings after 12pm\" // Caller: \"Yeah, I'll be there between 12:30 and 2:30.\" // Call ends.\nCaller agrees to drop off his or her vehicle for an unscheduled appointment time.\nExample call - Caller: \"Can I get my car in for service tomorrow?\" // Agent: \"What time do you need it done?\" // Caller: \"Anytime is fine. I'll just drop it off at 7:00 and leave it there for the day.\" // Agent: \"Great, we'll get it done before the end of the day.\"\nOption 3. Appointment requested / mentioned but not set\nCaller asked about a service appointment but did not agree to an appointment.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need to bring my car in for some routine service.\"// Receptionist or agent: \"We can fit you in tomorrow morning.\"// Caller: \"That won't work for me. I need to get it serviced today.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"I want to get my motor oil replaced. How much do you charge for that?\" // Price is provided and appointment requested. // Caller: \"Oh, that's too much. I'm not interested. Thanks.\"\nOption 4. No appointment, walk-in, or drop-off discussed\nCaller is asking about a service or there was an opportunity to book an appointment but no appointment, walk-in, or drop-off was discussed.\nExample call - Caller: \"Does your service department do oil changes?\"// Receptionist or agent: \"Yes\"// Caller: \"Thanks.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"I want to get my fluids flushed and replaced. How much do you charge for that?\" // Only the price is provided and NO potential appointment is mentioned. // Caller: \"Oh, that's too much. I\u2019m not interested. Thanks.\"\nOption 5. Upcoming scheduled appointment\nCaller discusses an existing appointment already scheduled for an upcoming time and/or date.\nCaller cancels or reschedules an appointment that was already scheduled for an upcoming time and/or date.\nOption 6. Vehicle already in service\nCaller discusses or asks about the status of a vehicle already in service.\nCaller adds services to a vehicle already in service.\nOption 7. No, not an appointment opportunity\nCall is general conversation, a personal call, or employee-to-employee conversation and no appointment opportunity exists.\nThe service requested is not offered by the dealership/shop/business.\nCaller asks if there are any recalls and is told there are no open recalls.\nCaller asks if vehicle is due for service and is told the vehicle is not due for service.\nCall is about parts only and there is no service mentioned.\nCaller is only discussing a bill without any discussion of services.\nCaller is only asking about a car wash without any discussion of services.\nCaller asks how to service something on their own and services are not needed from the service shop.\nExample: \"Can you tell me how to reset the code in my door panel?\" // Agent provides instructions over the phone. No appointment is requested/needed.\nCall is intended for the body shop. The body shop is a separate department from service.\nCall is intended for the collision center.

The qualified employee may at times need to call back in order to provide an answer or solution. As long as the same employee is the one intending to return the call, it is still considered connected.\nUnqualified agent: An employee that is not able to assist the caller with his or her inquiry. A caller may reach an unqualified employee and hold a conversation, but it is not considered a connected call unless the caller is connected to someone who can assist him or her with their inquiry.\nAppointment opportunity: Connected calls about potential maintenance or repair service(s) the shop can perform, repair or installation of a part that the shop can perform, or confirmed open recalls that the service shop can perform.\nService opportunities include but are not limited to:\nOil changes\nFluid flushes\nKey programming / key cutting / key battery replacement\nPart installation\nTire installation\nBattery installation\nCar detailing\nCall types that should NOT be considered service:\nBody work or collision repair\nCar washes\nFinance, sales, etc.\nInteractive systems and auto-attendants: Calls handled by an interactive system or auto-attendant will sound like interactive recordings that ask questions or request information and require the caller to interact by making phone selections. When a call is successfully handled by an interactive system or auto-attendant it should be considered a connected call, and proper review selections should be made according to the content and outcome of the call. When a caller leaves a call back number with the interactive system, instead of successfully handling their inquiry or need, then the call should be considered not connected.\nReminders:\nCalls in this category need to be reviewed based on this category's instructions. Overview instructions for other appointment related categories do not apply to this category.\nThe service appointment time should be considered the time the vehicle can be serviced.\nHere are the options:\nOption 1. Specific appointment or walk-in time / range within 1 hour\nCaller agrees to an appointment with a specific date and time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need a tune-up.\"// Receptionist or agent: \"We can fit you in at 11:45 tomorrow morning.\"// Caller: \"Perfect. I'll see you then!\"// Call ends.\nCaller approximates a loose time range, but the agent puts down a firm time for the appointment. In these instances, the agent\u2019s statement trumps the caller's.\nExample - Caller: \"I can be there between 2:00 and 4:00.\" // Agent: \"I'll put you down for 3:00, and then if you show up a little earlier or later, that's fine.\"\nCaller agrees to an appointment with a specific date and time but plans to drop the vehicle off before the scheduled appointment.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need an oil change.\"// Agent: \"I will schedule you for 10:00 AM tomorrow.\"// Caller: \"Can I drop my car off before my appointment?\" // Agent: \"Yes, you can drop your car off any time, and just leave your keys in the drop box.\"// Caller: \"Great, thanks!\" // Call ends.\nCaller agrees to an approximate time within a 1 hour time range because they are able to be serviced at the time of arrival.\nA walk-in time within an hour range, for a vehicle that can be serviced immediately, should be considered a specific appointment time. This is true because, even if an appointment is not put on the schedule, the service shop has an expected arrival time for the caller and the service can be completed at that arrival time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need to get my brakes repaired. Do you have any openings today?\"// Agent: \"You can come in now if you'd like\"// Caller: \"Great! I'll be there in half an hour.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"My car is being towed there right now and should be there in about 20 minutes. Can it be looked at right away?\" // Agent: \"Yeah, that's no problem. We'll look at it as soon as it arrives.\"\nCaller agrees to an approximate time of \"around 1 hour\".\nCaller discusses an existing appointment and agrees to a new appointment during the same call.\nExample call - Caller: \"I'm checking on the status of my car that's in service, and I also wanted to know if I could bring my wife's car in for an oil change.\"// Agent: \"Your car is ready to be picked up, we can get your wife's car in at 4:00 if that time works for you.\"// Caller: \"That works.

The caller may plan to drop off their vehicle before the scheduled appointment or agrees to an approximate time within a 1-hour range.

These calls may include callers who ask for information about a service, but do not commit to an appointment. The examples provided show callers who request an appointment, but do not agree to the offered appointment time, or decline to make an appointment after hearing the price.\n\nOption 4: means that there was no appointment, walk-in, or drop-off discussed during the call. The caller inquires about a service, such as oil changes or fluid replacement, but does not mention scheduling an appointment. In one example call, the caller simply thanks the receptionist or agent after inquiring about oil changes. In another example call, the caller asks about the cost of fluid replacement but ultimately decides not to proceed due to the price.\n\nOption 5: refers to a caller who already has an appointment scheduled for an upcoming date and time, and discusses it during the call. If the caller needs to cancel or reschedule their existing appointment, they can do so during the call.\n\nOption 6: pertains to callers whose vehicles are already in service. They may inquire about the status of their vehicle or request additional services to be performed while the vehicle is already being serviced.\n\nOption 7: covers a range of situations where no appointment opportunity is available. The call may be a general conversation, unrelated to an appointment or scheduling of services. Additionally, the service requested might not be offered by the dealership/shop/business. In other cases, the caller might ask about recalls or maintenance, but there are no open recalls or the vehicle is not due for service. The caller may discuss parts only, a bill, a car wash or how to service something on their own without needing any services from the service shop. The call may also pertain to the body shop or collision center, which are separate from the service department. In some cases, the agent may provide instructions or information, but no appointment is necessary.\n\nOption 8: indicates that the caller did not connect to a live, qualified agent. This may occur when the caller is left on hold, the call is disconnected and no contact information is shared or appointment discussion takes place or the caller reaches voicemail. It may also indicate situations when the caller had the wrong number or didn\u2019t reach the desired person or hung up during the bridge greeting Additionally, there may be cases when the call only consists of fax machine sounds or other similar noises.\n\nPlease read the transcript below and determine which category best applies:\n\n\"I need to get my brakes repaired.

The qualified employee may at times need to call back in order to provide an answer or solution. As long as the same employee is the one intending to return the call, it is still considered connected.\nUnqualified agent: An employee that is not able to assist the caller with his or her inquiry. A caller may reach an unqualified employee and hold a conversation, but it is not considered a connected call unless the caller is connected to someone who can assist him or her with their inquiry.\nAppointment opportunity: Connected calls about potential maintenance or repair service(s) the shop can perform, repair or installation of a part that the shop can perform, or confirmed open recalls that the service shop can perform.\nService opportunities include but are not limited to:\nOil changes\nFluid flushes\nKey programming / key cutting / key battery replacement\nPart installation\nTire installation\nBattery installation\nCar detailing\nCall types that should NOT be considered service:\nBody work or collision repair\nCar washes\nFinance, sales, etc.\nInteractive systems and auto-attendants: Calls handled by an interactive system or auto-attendant will sound like interactive recordings that ask questions or request information and require the caller to interact by making phone selections. When a call is successfully handled by an interactive system or auto-attendant it should be considered a connected call, and proper review selections should be made according to the content and outcome of the call. When a caller leaves a call back number with the interactive system, instead of successfully handling their inquiry or need, then the call should be considered not connected.\nReminders:\nCalls in this category need to be reviewed based on this category's instructions. Overview instructions for other appointment related categories do not apply to this category.\nThe service appointment time should be considered the time the vehicle can be serviced.\nHere are the options:\nOption 1. Specific appointment or walk-in time / range within 1 hour\nCaller agrees to an appointment with a specific date and time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need a tune-up.\"// Receptionist or agent: \"We can fit you in at 11:45 tomorrow morning.\"// Caller: \"Perfect. I'll see you then!\"// Call ends.\nCaller approximates a loose time range, but the agent puts down a firm time for the appointment. In these instances, the agent\u2019s statement trumps the caller's.\nExample - Caller: \"I can be there between 2:00 and 4:00.\" // Agent: \"I'll put you down for 3:00, and then if you show up a little earlier or later, that's fine.\"\nCaller agrees to an appointment with a specific date and time but plans to drop the vehicle off before the scheduled appointment.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need an oil change.\"// Agent: \"I will schedule you for 10:00 AM tomorrow.\"// Caller: \"Can I drop my car off before my appointment?\" // Agent: \"Yes, you can drop your car off any time, and just leave your keys in the drop box.\"// Caller: \"Great, thanks!\" // Call ends.\nCaller agrees to an approximate time within a 1 hour time range because they are able to be serviced at the time of arrival.\nA walk-in time within an hour range, for a vehicle that can be serviced immediately, should be considered a specific appointment time. This is true because, even if an appointment is not put on the schedule, the service shop has an expected arrival time for the caller and the service can be completed at that arrival time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need to get my brakes repaired. Do you have any openings today?\"// Agent: \"You can come in now if you'd like\"// Caller: \"Great! I'll be there in half an hour.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"My car is being towed there right now and should be there in about 20 minutes. Can it be looked at right away?\" // Agent: \"Yeah, that's no problem. We'll look at it as soon as it arrives.\"\nCaller agrees to an approximate time of \"around 1 hour\".\nCaller discusses an existing appointment and agrees to a new appointment during the same call.\nExample call - Caller: \"I'm checking on the status of my car that's in service, and I also wanted to know if I could bring my wife's car in for an oil change.\"// Agent: \"Your car is ready to be picked up, we can get your wife's car in at 4:00 if that time works for you.\"// Caller: \"That works. We'll be there at 4:00.\"\nOption 2. Unscheduled walk-in or loose appointment time / range exceeding 1 hour\nCaller gives a vague agreement to possibly come in.\nExample call - Caller: Do you have availability tomorrow morning. // Agent: \"Yes, we're pretty open all morning.\" // Caller: \"Okay, I may drop it off in the morning.\" // Call ends.\nCaller agrees to come in but approximates a time range that exceeds 1 hour.\nExample call - Caller: \"I'll be there in about 2 hours.\"\nCaller agrees to come in before or after a specific time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I can be there sometime before 4:00 PM.\"\nIn this example, the caller could be there anytime before 4:00, making this a loose appointment time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I won't be able to get there until after 5:00.\"\nIn this example, the caller could be there anytime after 5:00.\nReceptionist or agent tells the caller that it is first come, first served and the caller says \"OK.\"\nExample call - Caller: \"Do I need an appointment for an oil change?\"// Receptionist or agent: \"It is first come, first served.\"// Caller acknowledges this and the call ends.\nCaller agrees to be an unscheduled walk-in.\nExample call - Caller - \"Do you accept walk-ins?\" // Agent: \"We'll be accepting walk-ins all day Saturday.\" // Caller: \"I'll be there sometime Saturday then!\"\nCaller agrees to come in at a certain time but no appointment time is guaranteed.\nA walk-in time within an hour range, that can be serviced immediately, is a specific appointment time. However, a specific walk-in time with no specific service time cannot be considered a specific appointment, because the vehicle cannot be serviced immediately upon arrival. In the following example, the caller gives a specific arrival time, but the service time cannot be set for a specific time. Thus, it is a soft appointment time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need to get my car serviced as soon as possible.\" // Agent: \"We're all booked through the whole week.\" // Caller: \"Can I just come in and have my car serviced between other appointments?\" // Agent: \"You can come in and possibly have your car serviced if they have time, but we cannot guarantee a service time and you may be here for a few hours.\" // Caller: \"I'll just get there when you open tomorrow at 8:00, and I'll wait.\"\nCaller is having his or her vehicle towed in but no appointment time is guaranteed.\nReceptionist or agent tells the caller that no appointment is necessary, they can just show up.\nExample call - Caller: \"Can I get my tire rotated today?\" // Receptionist or agent: \"Absolutely. You don't need an appointment. Just come on in.\"// Caller acknowledges this and the call ends.\nThe time of the visit or walk-in is for a window of time that exceeds 1 hour.\nExample call - Caller: \"My check engine light is on and I'd like to come in to have it checked out.\" // Agent: \"No problem. Can you come in today? We have openings after 12pm\" // Caller: \"Yeah, I'll be there between 12:30 and 2:30.\" // Call ends.\nCaller agrees to drop off his or her vehicle for an unscheduled appointment time.\nExample call - Caller: \"Can I get my car in for service tomorrow?\" // Agent: \"What time do you need it done?\" // Caller: \"Anytime is fine. I'll just drop it off at 7:00 and leave it there for the day.\" // Agent: \"Great, we'll get it done before the end of the day.\"\nOption 3. Appointment requested / mentioned but not set\nCaller asked about a service appointment but did not agree to an appointment.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need to bring my car in for some routine service.\"// Receptionist or agent: \"We can fit you in tomorrow morning.\"// Caller: \"That won't work for me. I need to get it serviced today.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"I want to get my motor oil replaced. How much do you charge for that?\" // Price is provided and appointment requested. // Caller: \"Oh, that's too much. I'm not interested. Thanks.\"\nOption 4. No appointment, walk-in, or drop-off discussed\nCaller is asking about a service or there was an opportunity to book an appointment but no appointment, walk-in, or drop-off was discussed.\nExample call - Caller: \"Does your service department do oil changes?\"// Receptionist or agent: \"Yes\"// Caller: \"Thanks.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"I want to get my fluids flushed and replaced. How much do you charge for that?\" // Only the price is provided and NO potential appointment is mentioned. // Caller: \"Oh, that's too much. I\u2019m not interested. Thanks.\"\nOption 5. Upcoming scheduled appointment\nCaller discusses an existing appointment already scheduled for an upcoming time and/or date.\nCaller cancels or reschedules an appointment that was already scheduled for an upcoming time and/or date.\nOption 6. Vehicle already in service\nCaller discusses or asks about the status of a vehicle already in service.\nCaller adds services to a vehicle already in service.\nOption 7. No, not an appointment opportunity\nCall is general conversation, a personal call, or employee-to-employee conversation and no appointment opportunity exists.\nThe service requested is not offered by the dealership/shop/business.\nCaller asks if there are any recalls and is told there are no open recalls.\nCaller asks if vehicle is due for service and is told the vehicle is not due for service.\nCall is about parts only and there is no service mentioned.\nCaller is only discussing a bill without any discussion of services.\nCaller is only asking about a car wash without any discussion of services.\nCaller asks how to service something on their own and services are not needed from the service shop.\nExample: \"Can you tell me how to reset the code in my door panel?\" // Agent provides instructions over the phone. No appointment is requested/needed.\nCall is intended for the body shop. The body shop is a separate department from service.\nCall is intended for the collision center. The collision center is a separate department from service.\nOption 8. Correction: caller never connected to a live, qualified agent\nCaller never connected to a live, qualified agent.\nCaller is left on hold.\nCall connection was lost and no contact information was shared and/or no appointment discussion took place.\nCaller reached voicemail.\nCaller had the wrong number.\nCaller did not reach the desired person and left a live message.\n\n\nCaller did not reach the desired person and declined to leave a live message.\nCaller hung up during the bridge greeting.\nCall only consists of fax machine sounds or other similar noises.\n\nPlease read the transcript below and determine which category best applies:\n\n[insert transcript here]\n\nBased on the provided transcript, which category does this call belong to?

These can be either Connected or Not Connected.\nWhen a call is successfully handled by an interactive system or auto-attendant it should be considered a connected call, and proper review selections should be made according to the content and outcome of the call.\nWhen a caller leaves a call back number with the interactive system, instead of successfully handling their inquiry or need, then the call should be considered not connected.\nHere are the options:\nOpportunity to buy/sell/lease/trade a vehicle\nCall represented an opportunity for the dealership to buy, sell, lease, or trade a vehicle\nThe call does not have to include the mention of a particular make or model.\nSome opportunities to buy, sell, lease, or trade may at times only mention vehicle specs. These should be listened to carefully to determine if there is an opportunity for the dealership to buy, sell, lease, or trade a vehicle.\nAll calls that include a caller's interest in buying, selling, leasing, or trading a vehicle should be reviewed with this option, even if the vehicle is not currently available.\nCaller inquiries about a vehicle of interest\nThis may include but is not limited to inquiries about vehicles seen online, in an advertisement, or from driving past the dealership's lot.\nCaller expresses general interest in vehicle inventory\nThis may include but is not limited to inquiries regarding what vehicles are available that fit the caller's price range or what vehicles meet certain desired criteria.\nCall is about payment or financing options for the purchase of a vehicle\nThis does not include calls regarding the financing of a vehicle that is already in the caller's possession.\nCaller is inquiring about leasing a vehicle or is interested in a lease buyout\nCaller would like to sell or trade a vehicle to the dealership\nCaller is another dealership that represents an opportunity to buy or sell a vehicle\nThis does not include conversations about dealer trades. Dealer trades are not opportunities for a dealership to buy or sell a vehicle. Dealer trades, sometimes also referred to as dealer swaps, are when competing dealerships trade cars with each other, swapping similar cars to meet the demands of their customers. These are exchanges of vehicles only, and they do not represent buying or selling.\nService / parts / collision / body shop\nCall is regarding automotive service\nThis may include but is not limited to service department hour inquiries, general service questions, service needs, service appointments, or inquiring about the status of a vehicle that is already being serviced by the dealership.\nCall is regarding automotive parts\nThis may include but is not limited to parts department hour inquiries, general parts questions, part orders, or price and installation inquiries.\nCall is regarding automotive collision or the body shop\nThis may include but is not limited to collision or body shop department hour inquiries, general collision or body shop questions, price and repair inquiries, and collision or body shop appointments.\nGeneral / caller not in market / dealer trade\nCaller has general questions or a general conversation that does not represent an opportunity for the buying, selling, or trading of a vehicle\nCaller is inquiring about the status of a vehicle order that has already been placed\nCaller is inquiring about the delivery of a vehicle they have already purchased\nCaller is from a transport company delivering a vehicle or multiple vehicles\nCall is about financing and there was no opportunity for the buying, selling, or trading of a vehicle\nCall is about the refinancing of a vehicle that is already in the caller's possession\nCall is about the payments for a vehicle that is already in the caller's possession\nCaller only states that they are coming to the dealership to drop off paperwork, payment, or another item but they do not specify what the drop off is for\nUnless a caller specifies that the drop off is regarding an opportunity to buy, sell, lease, or trade a vehicle, or that the drop off is for the service, parts, collision, or body shop departments, then we cannot assume what the drop off is regarding and the call should be considered general.\nCall is about the renewal of an existing lease\nCall is about the rental of a vehicle or a loaner car\nCaller is inquiring about a warranty, tags, or plates\nCaller only asks about hours of operation for the business and does not specify a department of service, parts, collision, or body shop\nIf a caller specifies the sales department, but they only ask about hours of operation for the sales department, it does not represent an opportunity for the buying, selling, or trading of a vehicle and should be considered a general call.\nCaller is returning a missed call but the call ends with neither caller nor business identifying the original caller or reason for the call\nIf a caller's sole inquiry is to identify the reason for a missed call, and they are told by the answering agent that the original caller or reason for the call cannot be identified, this is considered enough information to satisfy the caller's reason for calling. The caller needs no further information, nor needs any further connection to any agent or employee. Thus, the answering agent is qualified, and the call is considered handled.\nCaller is returning a missed call but is not in the market to buy, sell, trade, or lease a vehicle\nThis will often sound like an agent asking a caller if he or she is interested in buying, selling, leasing, or trading in a vehicle, and the caller informing the agent that he or she is not in the market.\nCalls should only be considered opportunities when the caller is in the market, regardless of if the agent mentioned a specific vehicle or attempted to encourage the caller to buy, sell, lease, or trade a vehicle. When callers are not in the market, they do not represent business opportunities for the dealership.\nCall is regarding a dealer trade\nDealer trades are not opportunities for a dealership to buy or sell a vehicle. Dealer trades, sometimes also referred to as dealer swaps, are when competing dealerships trade cars with each other, swapping similar cars to meet the demands of their customers. These are exchanges of vehicles only, and they do not represent buying or selling.\nCaller is from a third-party company asking for information about a vehicle that a mutual customer is interested in\nCalls from a third-party company, such as a finance company, may request vehicle information for their own business needs regarding the mutual customer. These third-party companies are not customers, and therefore should not be considered an opportunity to buy, sell, lease, or trade a vehicle.\nCaller only refers someone to the dealership but does not themself represent an opportunity for the caller to buy, sell, lease, or trade a vehicle\nA referrer alone is not the customer. They are solely attempting to provide the dealership with information about a potential customer. A call should only be considered an opportunity to buy, sell, lease, or trade a vehicle once the actual customer and dealership connect.\nCall is an agent-to-agent discussion about a mutual customer but does not represent an opportunity to buy, sell, lease, or trade a vehicle on behalf of the customer\nAgent-to-agent discussions, regarding internal business for the dealership, do not themselves represent opportunities.\nA call should only be considered an opportunity to buy, sell, lease, or trade a vehicle when the actual customer is the one involved in the discussion with dealership or when the agent involved is speaking on behalf of the customer with the intent to buy, sell, lease, or trade a vehicle.\nCorrection: caller never connected to a live, qualified agent\nCall was not handled by a live, qualified employee/agent.\nYou can reference the instructions for the upstream category Inbound if you need assistance in understanding what qualifies as a call that is handled by a live, qualified employee/agent"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Dealership Discussion category aims to identify the topic of conversation between the caller and the dealership. \n\nImportant information:\nConnected calls:\nFor a call to be reviewed under this category, it must be connected.

I'll see you then!\"// Call ends.\nCaller approximates a loose time range, but the agent puts down a firm time for the appointment. In these instances, the agent\u2019s statement trumps the caller's.\nExample - Caller: \"I can be there between 2:00 and 4:00.\" // Agent: \"I'll put you down for 3:00, and then if you show up a little earlier or later, that's fine.\"\nCaller agrees to an appointment with a specific date and time but plans to drop the vehicle off before the scheduled appointment.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need an oil change.\"// Agent: \"I will schedule you for 10:00 AM tomorrow.\"// Caller: \"Can I drop my car off before my appointment?\" // Agent: \"Yes, you can drop your car off any time, and just leave your keys in the drop box.\"// Caller: \"Great, thanks!\" // Call ends.\nCaller agrees to an approximate time within a 1 hour time range because they are able to be serviced at the time of arrival.\nA walk-in time within an hour range, for a vehicle that can be serviced immediately, should be considered a specific appointment time. This is true because, even if an appointment is not put on the schedule, the service shop has an expected arrival time for the caller and the service can be completed at that arrival time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need to get my brakes repaired. Do you have any openings today?\"// Agent: \"You can come in now if you'd like\"// Caller: \"Great!

However, a specific walk-in time with no specific service time cannot be considered a specific appointment, because the vehicle cannot be serviced immediately upon arrival. In the following example, the caller gives a specific arrival time, but the service time cannot be set for a specific time. Thus, it is a soft appointment time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need to get my car serviced as soon as possible.\" // Agent: \"We're all booked through the whole week.\" // Caller: \"Can I just come in and have my car serviced between other appointments?\" // Agent: \"You can come in and possibly have your car serviced if they have time, but we cannot guarantee a service time and you may be here for a few hours.\" // Caller: \"I'll just get there when you open tomorrow at 8:00, and I'll wait.\"\nCaller is having his or her vehicle towed in but no appointment time is guaranteed.\nReceptionist or agent tells the caller that no appointment is necessary, they can just show up.\nExample call - Caller: \"Can I get my tire rotated today?\" // Receptionist or agent: \"Absolutely. You don't need an appointment. Just come on in.\"// Caller acknowledges this and the call ends.\nThe time of the visit or walk-in is for a window of time that exceeds 1 hour.\nExample call - Caller: \"My check engine light is on and I'd like to come in to have it checked out.\" // Agent: \"No problem. Can you come in today? We have openings after 12pm\" // Caller: \"Yeah, I'll be there between 12:30 and 2:30.\" // Call ends.\nCaller agrees to drop off his or her vehicle for an unscheduled appointment time.\nExample call - Caller: \"Can I get my car in for service tomorrow?\" // Agent: \"What time do you need it done?\" // Caller: \"Anytime is fine. I'll just drop it off at 7:00 and leave it there for the day.\" // Agent: \"Great, we'll get it done before the end of the day.\"\nAppointment requested / mentioned but not set\nCaller asked about a service appointment but did not agree to an appointment.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need to bring my car in for some routine service.\"// Receptionist or agent: \"We can fit you in tomorrow morning.\"// Caller: \"That won't work for me. I need to get it serviced today.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"I want to get my motor oil replaced. How much do you charge for that?\" // Price is provided and appointment requested. // Caller: \"Oh, that's too much. I'm not interested. Thanks.\"\nNo appointment, walk-in, or drop-off discussed\nCaller is asking about a service or there was an opportunity to book an appointment but no appointment, walk-in, or drop-off was discussed.\nExample call - Caller: \"Does your service department do oil changes?\"// Receptionist or agent: \"Yes\"// Caller: \"Thanks.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"I want to get my fluids flushed and replaced.

No appointment is requested/needed.\nCall is intended for the body shop. The body shop is a separate department from service.\nCall is intended for the collision center.
