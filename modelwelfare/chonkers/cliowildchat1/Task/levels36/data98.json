However, there might be some other issues that prevent it from working correctly.\n\nHere are a few things you can try to troubleshoot the issue:\n\n1. Make sure the bot is properly connected to the Minecraft server and is listening for chat messages. You can test this by having a player send a chat message to the server and see if the bot responds to it.\n\n2. Check the exact text of the chat message that triggers the bot response. Make sure it exactly matches the pattern \"\u4eceusername\u6536\u5230\u4e86$amount\u3002\", including the full stop (.) at the end. Also, double-check that the username and amount values are correctly extracted from the message.\n\n3. Make sure there are no other bots or plugins on the server that might interfere with the chat message handling. Sometimes, other bots or plugins might also listen for chat messages and consume them before your code has a chance to handle them.\n\n4. Add some console.log statements in your code to print out debugging information, such as the chat message text and the extracted username and amount values. This can help you verify that your code is correctly processing the chat message and responding with the correct message.\n\nIf none of the above suggestions work, you can also try running your code in a standalone Node.js script and see if it responds to test chat messages. That way, you can isolate the code from any other factors that might influence its behavior."}, {"role": "user", "content": " the text is the text is \"\u4eceYokomi_\u6536\u5230\u4e86$1\u3002\" why is it not working? bot.on('chat', (username, message) => {\n    if (message.toString().match(/^\u4ece(.+)\u6536\u5230\u4e86\\$(\\d+)\\\u3002$/)) {\n      const match = message.toString().match(/^\u4ece(.+)\u6536\u5230\u4e86\\$(\\d+)\\\u3002$/);\n      const giverUsername = match[1];\n      const amount = match[2];\n      bot.chat(`Thank you, ${giverUsername}, for giving me $${amount}!`);\n    }\n  });"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The code you provided looks like it should work fine for this specific chat message \"\u4eceYokomi_\u6536\u5230\u4e86$1\u3002\". It uses a regular expression to match the pattern and extracts the giver's username and the dollar amount from the message.\n\nThe only issue I can think of is that the bot may not be listening for chat messages at all, or there might be some other code that is overriding this code block. Here are a few things you can try:\n\n1. Make sure the bot instance is properly created and logged in to the server.\n\n2. Verify that the chat event is being properly triggered on the bot by adding a `console.log` statement to the event listener:\n\n```\nbot.on('chat', (username, message) => {\n  console.log(`Received chat message: ${message}`);\n  // rest of the code...\n});\n```\n\nIf you see the chat messages being displayed in the console, then the bot is properly receiving chat messages.\n\n3. Try testing with a different chat message to make sure the regular expression is correctly matching the pattern. For example, you can send a message like \"Hey, I just got $1 from Yokomi_! Thanks!\" and see if the bot responds to it.\n\n4. Make sure there are no other bots or plugins on the server that might interfere with the chat message handling. Sometimes, other bots or plugins might also listen for chat messages and consume them before your code has a chance to handle them.\n\nI hope this helps you troubleshoot the issue!

Then create a new Python file (e.g., `bot.py`) and add the following code:\n\n```python\nimport logging\nimport os\nfrom dropbox import DropboxOAuth2FlowNoRedirect\nfrom dropbox import Dropbox\nfrom aiogram import Bot, Dispatcher, types\nfrom aiogram.contrib.middlewares.logging import LoggingMiddleware\nfrom aiogram.types import ParseMode\nfrom aiogram.utils import executor\n\nTOKEN = 'YOUR_TG_BOT_API_TOKEN'\nAPP_KEY = 'YOUR_DROPBOX_APP_KEY'\nAPP_SECRET = 'YOUR_DROPBOX_APP_SECRET'\n\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n\nbot = Bot(token=TOKEN)\ndp = Dispatcher(bot)\ndp.middleware.setup(LoggingMiddleware())\n\n\n@dp.message_handler(commands=['start'])\nasync def cmd_start(message: types.Message):\n    auth_flow = DropboxOAuth2FlowNoRedirect(APP_KEY, APP_SECRET)\n    authorize_url = auth_flow.start()\n\n    reply_text = (\n        \"To use this bot, authorize me to access your Dropbox account.\\n\"\n        f\"[Click here to authorize access]({authorize_url})\"\n    )\n    await message.reply(reply_text, parse_mode=ParseMode.MARKDOWN, disable_web_page_preview=True)\n    \n\n@dp.message_handler(commands=['auth'])\nasync def cmd_auth(message: types.Message):\n    auth_code = message.get_args()\n\n    if not auth_code:\n        await message.reply(\"Please provide the OAuth2 code received after authorization.\")\n        return\n\n    auth_flow = DropboxOAuth2FlowNoRedirect(APP_KEY, APP_SECRET)\n    try:\n        access_token, user_id, url_state = auth_flow.finish(auth_code)\n    except Exception as e:\n        await message.reply(f\"Error: {e}\")\n        return\n\n    dbx = Dropbox(access_token)\n    try:\n        account = dbx.users_get_current_account()\n        await message.reply(f\"Hello, {account.name.display_name}!

Run the `bot.py` script, and your bot will be up and running.\n\nCurrently, the bot only lists the files in the root directory of your Dropbox account. Add more functional commands to develop your bot further.\n\n**Note**: The example above doesn't handle user-specific access tokens.

First, make sure you have the Transformers library installed. Run the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\npip install transformers\n```\n\n2. Here's an example using GPT-2 from the Transformers library:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel\n\n# Load pre-trained GPT-2 model and tokenizer\ntokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(\"gpt2\")\nmodel = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(\"gpt2\").cuda()\n\ndef chatbot_response(prompt):\n    input_text = f\"{prompt}\\n\"\n    inputs = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").cuda()\n    outputs = model.generate(inputs, max_length=250, no_repeat_ngram_size=3, do_sample=True, pad_token_id=50256, temperature=0.8, top_p=0.8)\n    response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\n    return response.strip().split(\"\\n\")[-1]\n\nprint(\"Chatbot ready, type 'bye' to end the conversation.\")\nwhile True:\n    user_input = input(\"You: \")\n    if user_input.lower() == \"bye\":\n        print(\"AI Chatbot: Goodbye!\")\n        break\n    else:\n        reply = chatbot_response(user_input)\n        print(\"AI Chatbot:\", reply)\n```\n\nThis code sets up a chatbot using the GPT-2 model from the Transformers library. In the `chatbot_response` function, it takes user input as a prompt, generates tokens, and gets the model's response. The conversation loop is similar to the previous example.\n\nRemember, GPT-2 model is resource-intensive, and it's recommended to run this on a machine with a GPU. If you're running this on a CPU-only machine, you can remove the `.cuda()` calls from the code. Keep in mind that the response time will likely be slower without GPU acceleration.\n\nIf you want to use GPT-3, you will need an API key from OpenAI, as it is not available as a pre-trained model like GPT-2.

The parents, Ma and Ba, are both of Chinese descent, something most people today would consider an anomaly. However, in her book, Zhang explores the untold stories of thousands of Chinese people who set out toward the wild west in search of gold. Throughout the novel, Zhang explores themes of race, home, belonging, and gender and how they shape the world around the four main characters, including the two children, Lucy and Sam. When viewing the text from a literary analysis perspective, an interesting question arises: How do Lucy and Ma\u2019s gender as women shape their experiences and interactions with the world around them, and how does Zhang portray gender expression and the connotations associated with that expression? Through the clever use of sentence structure, metaphor, dialogue, and word choice, Zhang uses the characters of Lucy and Ma to tell the untold story of women in the wild west and comment on the impact that gender had on shaping the lives of these women. \nUtilizing literary devices of metaphor and contrast, Zhang helps the reader understand the implications of beauty and the role of gender in the life of Lucy. Understanding the unfortunate reality of being a woman in the wild west in the 1850s, Ma takes it upon herself to teach Lucy the strategies and methods that have brought her success throughout her life. One of these lessons is to use beauty to her advantage, a theme introduced in the first chapter when Lucy recalls her mother\u2019s words, \u201cBeauty is a weapon,\u201d (Zhang 77). This short sentence fragment allows Zhang to convey the urgency and intensity of Ma\u2019s speech. Frequently, the most essential ideas must be conveyed concisely, and Ma\u2019s comment to Lucy exemplifies this. Additionally, Zhang\u2019s use of metaphor helps to convey the complexity of beauty as a weapon. This comparison implies that it can be used to attack or defend, depending on the wielder\u2019s intentions. Additionally, the metaphor underscores the idea that beauty is not simply a passive trait but an active force that shapes a person\u2019s experiences and interactions. Shortly thereafter, Ma tells Lucy that beauty is \u201cnot the kind of weapon (Sam) plays with,\u201d creating a contrast between Lucy and Sam, who are different in their gender identities and, consequently, different in their life paths (Zhang 77). Using this contrast, the author is able to effectively convey Ma\u2019s belief that Lucy\u2019s value is in her beauty. While Sam prefers to use guns and knives, Lucy is more traditionally feminine, leading to the world expecting certain things from her. Through Ma\u2019s teachings, the author reveals the harsh reality of a world that does not value women for their intellect or strength but rather for their physical appearance. Ma teaches Lucy that she is expected to use her beauty as a means of protection and advantage and that she should leverage it to gain favor and security in a hostile environment. \nZhang includes literary devices of word choice, analogy, and dialogue to comment on the reality Lucy endures as a woman of Chinese descent in the 1850s. While Ma taught Lucy to use beauty to her advantage, what Ma fails to teach her daughter is that beauty is a double-edged sword. Eventually, Ma\u2019s teachings are put into practice when Lucy and Sam end up in a financial predicament. Sam gets himself into debt when he steals gold from a rival prospector named the Gold Rush Man, and Lucy knows that there will be dire consequences if Sam\u2019s debt is not paid off. Lucy then takes it upon herself to work as a prostitute to earn money to pay off the debt, paying it back remarkably quickly. Lucy describes it as easy because she \u201cdug a grave years ago; now she throws into it every Sam and every Lucy that came before,\u201d (Zhang 221). Zhang depicts an almost impossible predicament in which Lucy finds herself: While no part of Lucy wants to sell her body to pay off a debt, Lucy also understands the unfortunate reality that there are very few other ways for a single woman in the wild west to acquire money. The imagery and analogy Zhang uses of throwing one\u2019s old self into a grave serve to depict Lucy adopting a new persona. By burying her past and adopting a new identity, she is able to distance herself from the shame and stigma associated with sex work. The passage also highlights the dehumanizing nature of prostitution, as men see her as an object to be used for their own pleasure and desires. Zhang writes about Lucy\u2019s first experience with her madam, saying that \u201cLucy knows what value this woman sees in her\u2026 Lucy\u2019s difference. She speaks the first words that come to her. \u2018Nu er.\u2019 Elske sighs. \u2018How very beautiful. How very precious and rare,\u201d\u2019 (Zhang 210). Zhang\u2019s use of dialogue depicts how Lucy\u2019s difference in race is exploited by others who see her as a commodity rather than a person. Elske is intrigued by her beauty, claiming that she is \u201cvery precious and rare,\u201d however, Elske\u2019s words are ironic and insincere, as she only values Lucy for the money she can make from her. Zhang utilizes the character of Elske to show how non-white people in the wild west were never able to truly fit in, even with those who claim to value their diversity. Elske does not care about Lucy\u2019s identity or history but only about her exotic appearance. Zhang also shows how Lucy is forced to lie about her origins and pretend to be a foreigner by speaking in Mandarin. The word \u201cNu er\u201d means \u201cdaughter\u201d in Mandarin, a term of affection that Ma used to call Lucy. By using this word, Zhang creates a contrast between Ma\u2019s genuine love for Lucy and Elske\u2019s fake interest in her. The author\u2019s choices of words and language reveal how Lucy\u2019s race and gender are both sources of pride and pain for her and how she tries to survive in a society that does not accept her. Shortly after ending her job with Elske, Lucy realizes that, \u201cMa wasn\u2019t wrong, just as Ma wasn\u2019t right. Beauty is a weapon, one that can strangle its wielder,\u201d highlighting the double-edged nature of beauty as a tool that can both empower and harm women (Zhang 197).  Zhang\u2019s use of the word \u201cstrangle\u201d emphasizes the danger of beauty, suggesting that Lucy\u2019s pressure to conform to societal beauty standards suffocates her true identity. Additionally, the use of parallelism in \u201cMa wasn\u2019t wrong, just as Ma wasn\u2019t right\u201d also serves to highlight the nuanced nature of beauty and its impact on individuals. By acknowledging that beauty is not inherently good or bad, Zhang invites readers to consider the complex ways in which gender, identity, and societal expectations intersect. \nFinally, Zhang explores themes of gender and societal expectations through the character Ma and leverages word choice to underline ideas of gender expectations and empowering women. An example of these literary choices appears when Ma prepares Lucy for her day at school with teacher Leigh. Ma teaches Lucy that \u201cGirls have power too,\u201d the word \u201ctoo\u201d carrying interesting connotations with it (Zhang 77). Zhang uses it to comment on the gender power dynamics of the time. Zhang\u2019s addition of the word \u201ctoo\u201d challenges the stereotypes and myths of the Old West, where women are often portrayed as passive victims who are at the whim of their husbands. This challenging of stereotypes is a persistent theme throughout the book, as all four characters\u2019 presence in the wild west alone contradicts the norms of the time. Whether it is through race or gender, Zhang is not hesitant to have her characters challenge the status quo, reflective of an intention to provoke deep discourse amongst readers. Circling back to the concept of beauty, it may seem that beauty has only brought Ma and Lucy success in life; however, Zhang also shows the limitations and dangers of relying on beauty as a weapon. Throughout the novel, Lucy faces discrimination, harassment, and violence because of her looks, resulting in an inner struggle with her self-image and identity as she tries to fit into different roles and expectations. Zhang\u2019s literary choice reveals how beauty can be both a blessing and a curse for a girl who is searching for her place in the world, ultimately suggesting that beauty is not a reliable or empowering weapon but rather a source of vulnerability and conflict, as seen in Lucy\u2019s story. Another literary choice Zhang makes is using the word \u201ccostume\u201d to describe how Ma disguises herself as a man to work in the mine with Ba. Zhang writes, \u201cMa transformed each morning before heading to the mine with Ba. She hid her hair under a cap\u2026 It was a costume, Ma explained,\u201d (Zhang 51).  Zhang\u2019s utilization of the word \u201ccostume\u201d implies that Ma is not showing her true self but rather putting on a performance to fit into a hostile environment that does not accept her as a Chinese woman. Zhang also uses the word \u201chid,\u201d which conveys the idea of how Ma has to conceal her hair and, as a result, her femininity. Ma must reduce who she truly is in order to survive in the wild west. By using these words, Zhang shows how Ma sacrifices her identity and dignity for the sake of survival and the protection of her family, revealing how the characters struggle to find a place to call home in a land that does not welcome them.\n\tIn summary, the literary devices Zhang uses help the reader understand the characters\u2019 experiences and how their gender shapes their stories and the world around them. Through the use of literary devices such as sentence structure, analogy, metaphor, dialogue, and word choice, Zhang tells the untold story of women in the wild west and uses the characters Ma and Lucy to challenge the gender norms of the time. Additionally, the story of Chinese Americans throughout the gold rush has been historically underrepresented, and most people today are unfortunately unaware of the lived experiences of women throughout this time. However, Zhang makes an important step in the right direction toward representing these historically underrepresented people in literature today.\n\nWorks Cited\nZhang, C. Pam.

To install it, simply run:\n\n```\ngo get -u github.com/go-telegram-bot-api/telegram-bot-api\n```\n\n2. Create a bot using the BotFather and get the API token\nYou need to create a bot on Telegram using the BotFather bot. Search for \"BotFather\" on Telegram, send it a message with `/newbot` and follow the instructions. Once you finish, the BotFather will give you the API token for your bot.\n\n3. Implement the bot\nCreate a file called `main.go` and paste the following code into it. Replace `<your_bot_api_token>` with the API token provided by the BotFather.\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"log\"\n\n\t\"github.com/go-telegram-bot-api/telegram-bot-api\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tbot, err := tgbotapi.NewBotAPI(\"<your_bot_api_token>\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Panic(err)\n\t}\n\n\tbot.Debug = false\n\tlog.Printf(\"Authorized on account %s\", bot.Self.UserName)\n\n\tu := tgbotapi.NewUpdate(0)\n\tu.Timeout = 60\n\tupdates, err := bot.GetUpdatesChan(u)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Panic(err)\n\t}\n\n\tfor update := range updates {\n\t\tif update.Message == nil {\n\t\t\tcontinue\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tlog.Printf(\"[%s] %s\", update.Message.From.UserName, update.Message.Text)\n\t\tmsg := tgbotapi.NewMessage(update.Message.Chat.ID, \"Hello, I am your bot!\")\n\n\t\tif _, err := bot.Send(msg); err != nil {\n\t\t\tlog.Panic(err)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n5. Build and run the bot\nRun the following command to build and run the bot:\n\n```\ngo build main.go\n./main\n```\n\nThe bot should be up and running now. You can search for the bot by its username on Telegram and interact with it.\n\nRemember this is a simple example of a telegrab bot.

Another is holding the line at four robot-performed jobs. \"Five would be overkill,\" he said.\nMS\nBy Maxwell Strachan\nApril 12, 2023, 1:00pm\n\n\n\n\nLoading your audio article\n\nScreen Shot 2023-04-11 at 4\nCREDIT: GETTY STOCK PHOTO)\nAbout a year ago, Ben found out that one of his friends had quietly started to work multiple jobs at the same time. The idea had become popular during the COVID-19 pandemic, when working from home became normalized, making the scheme easier to pull off. A community of multi-job hustlers, in fact, had come together online, referring to themselves as the \u201coveremployed.\u201d \n\nThe idea excited Ben, who lives in Toronto and asked that Motherboard not use his real name, but he didn\u2019t think it was possible for someone like him to pull it off. He helps financial technology companies market new products; the job involves creating reports, storyboards, and presentations, all of which involve writing. There was \u201cno way,\u201d he said, that he could have done his job two times over on his own. \n\nADVERTISEMENT\nThen, last year, he started to hear more and more about ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence chatbot developed by the research lab OpenAI. Soon enough, he was trying to figure out how to use it to do his job faster and more efficiently, and what had been a time-consuming job became much easier. (\"Not a little bit more easy,\u201d he said, \u201clike, way easier.\") That alone didn\u2019t make him unique in the marketing world. Everyone he knew was using ChatGPT at work, he said. But he started to wonder whether he could pull off a second job. Then, this year, he took the plunge, a decision he attributes to his new favorite online robot toy. \n\nHow are people you know using ChatGPT at work? We want to hear from you. From a non-work device, contact our reporter at <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> or via Signal at 310-614-3752 for extra security.\n\n\u201cThat's the only reason I got my job this year,\u201d Ben said of OpenAI's tool. \u201cChatGPT does like 80 percent of my job if I\u2019m being honest.\u201d He even used it to generate cover letters to apply for jobs.\n\nOver the last few months, the exploding popularity of ChatGPT and similar products has led to growing concerns about AI\u2019s potential effects on the international job market\u2014specifically, the percentage of jobs that could be automated away, replaced by a well-oiled army of chatbots. But for a small cohort of fast-thinking and occasionally devious go-getters, AI technology has turned into an opportunity not to be feared but exploited, with their employers apparently none the wiser. \n\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe people Motherboard spoke with for this article requested anonymity to avoid losing their jobs. For clarity, Motherboard in some cases assigned people aliases in order to differentiate them, though we verified each of their identities. Some, like Ben, were drawn into the overemployed community as a result of ChatGPT. Others who were already working multiple jobs have used recent advancements in AI to turbocharge their situation, like one Ohio-based technology worker who upped his number of jobs from two to four after he started to integrate ChatGPT into his work process. \u201cI think five would probably just be overkill,\u201d he said. \n\n\u2018The Best Assistant Ever\u2019\nThroughout the overemployed community, there is a quiet arms race to figure out just how much of the corporate workday can be automated away using an assortment of AI tools, some of which predate ChatGPT. The possibility of increasing their income, or at least easing the burden of holding down multiple jobs, has led to an explosion of experimentation.\n\nWhen one of Ben\u2019s bosses, for example, now asks him to create a story for an upcoming product release, he will explain the context and provide a template to ChatGPT, which then creates an outline for him and helps fill out the sections. The AI chatbot knows Ben\u2019s title and the parameters of his duties and has become even better at understanding the context since the launch of GPT-4, the latest edition, he said. \u201cI can just tell it to create a story,\u201d said Ben, \u201cand it just does it for me, based off the context that I gave it.\u201d Ben still needs to verify the information\u2014\u201dsometimes it gets stuff wrong, which is totally normal,\u201d he said\u2014but the adjustments are relatively \u201cminor\u201d and easy to fix. \n\nADVERTISEMENT\nOccasionally, he even asks ChatGPT to craft responses to Slack messages from his manager. In such cases, he requests that ChatGPT write the message in all lowercase, so that it appears more organic to the boss.  Another overemployed worker also told me they have started using ChatGPT to transcribe Zoom meetings so they can be largely ignored in the moment and referenced later.\n\nCharles, who has worked as a software engineer and product manager and solutions architect, including at a FAANG company, had been all-in on overemployment since 2020\u2014while he currently works two jobs, he worked four at the height of the pandemic\u2014but said that AI tools have made juggling the positions much easier. \n\nAt the FAANG company, he was able to outsource written tasks to AI tools, like writing a memo to defend and justify a business decision. In such a case, he\u2019d input the relevant facts and parameters into an AI chatbot, which would cohesively lay them out more quickly than he ever could. Additionally, he\u2019d use it to lay out directions for engineers (\u201cIt allows you to take, basically, a sentence and expand it out into a paragraph\u201d); and create a \u201cfoundation\u201d when coding. The ChatGPT-created code \u201coftentimes\u201d would work perfectly, he said, but the errors could be identified and resolved easily enough, he said. \n\nOne member of the overemployed, who, unusually, works three financial reporting jobs, said he\u2019s found ChatGPT useful in the creation of macros in Excel. \u201cI can create macros, but it takes me an hour, two hours, plus, to write the code, test it, make sure everything's working,\u201d he said. By comparison, with ChatGPT, he can provide the parameters and it\u2019ll \u201cspit something out\u201d that he can update and tweak to his specifications. The process can allow him to cram what is traditionally a \u201ctwo-week long process\u201d into a few hours.  (He says he avoids providing ChatGPT with confidential information.)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nDaniel, a staff engineer on the East Coast who works one director-level position and another as a senior dev (one job is on Pacific time and one is in the United Kingdom), similarly said that ChatGPT\u2019s code can leave something to be desired, but said it\u2019s been useful when it comes to writing emails. \u201cMost people in tech probably aren't as good at writing things as most other people,\u201d Daniel said. He included himself in that critique of his own industry, but said it\u2019s no longer a problem, as he can plug the key points into ChatGPT and ask the AI assistant to rewrite it \u201cin a more professional way,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's really good for stuff like that.\u201d\n\nExcitement for the potential of ChatGPT isn\u2019t limited to the technology and financial spheres of the overemployed community. Marshall, a university lecturer in the United Kingdom who secretly runs a digital marketing agency and tech startup on the side, has become a ChatGPT fanatic since its release. (During class, he often has students run through exercises, during which time he is often able to open up his laptop and work on his side hustles.) \u201cIt\u2019s the best assistant ever,\u201d he told me excitedly.\n\nMarshall has come to see himself as the idea man, and ChatGPT as the labor. \u201cI'm quite a conceptualizing person. So I'm quite happy for my brain to do that. But the first draft of anything almost always goes through GPT,\u201d he said.  Already, the chatbot has helped him generate business plans, internal system documents, blog posts, and Excel spreadsheets. He estimated that ChatGPT can often pull off 80 percent of the legwork, leaving him to handle the final 20 percent.  \n\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe tool has even helped him win a grant from the U.K. government (the application was \u201c50-50 me and ChatGPT,\u201d he said) and complete coursework for a master\u2019s degree necessary to receive a university teaching qualification he was too busy to handle by himself while working three jobs.\n\nThe members of the overemployed community know that what they\u2019re doing is frowned on by corporate leaders. But that doesn\u2019t mean they think what they are doing is amoral. \u201cI never could mentally comprehend why it was so taboo for me to work two salaried positions,\u201d said the Ohio-based technology worker. \u201cThere's plenty of people I've known in my personal life who have worked at Walmart from 4 a.m. to 2 p.m., and then gone and worked another job.\u201d The financial professional similarly said he started working multiple jobs because he doesn't trust that working as hard as he can at a single job will be \u201crewarded with more pay,\u201d just \u201cmore work.\u201d By taking on more jobs, he can do more work but also \u201cget paid for it,\u201d he said. \n\n\u2018One Loom Operator As Opposed to 100 Weavers\u2019\nMore than a member of the overemployed community, Charles, the FAANG alumni, considers himself part of the FIRE movement\u2014short for \u201cFinancial Independence, Retire Early\u201d Not yet 30, he is already making $500,000 working two jobs and worth around $3 million, claims he backed up to Motherboard with documentation. But he hopes to increase his compensation to $800,000 by tacking on a third position, and reach a net worth of $10 million by 35.\n\nEven though he is already using ChatGPT to work multiple jobs, Charles still is trying to figure out ways to make his dream even easier to obtain. When we spoke he said he\u2019s already been \u201cable to outsource\u201d coding tasks to a third party in the past, and that he has been hard at work trying to develop a way to have someone else mimic both his voice and image on a computer screen. Once he can do so, he said, he hopes to offshore his job to someone in India who can \u201cdo my job for me.\u201d \n\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn such moments, it can feel like the AI-infused overemployed community is taking advantage of a brief moment in time, when the tools that can be used to automate a job are much better understood by the workforce than the bosses with hiring and firing ability. One person, who works multiple jobs in information technology, spoke openly about the tension that created: People can more easily hold down multiple jobs today; but, should the bosses realize just how much their jobs can be handled by robots, they could be at risk of their jobs being automated away. As a result, he said, there\u2019s good reason to keep quiet about what they\u2019ve discovered.\n\nMost of the overemployed workers themselves maintain that their jobs require a baseline level of expertise, even with ChatGPT. Still, some members of the overemployed community feel they have peered into the future, and not liked everything they\u2019ve seen.\n\nOne such person is Ryan, who works multiple jobs in data analytics and marketing in a large Midwestern city. Over the last year, he has watched in astonishment as ChatGPT figured out a way to automate an ever-growing percentage of his job, including writing ad copy and blog posts. The feat can feel exciting, and it has temporarily made his job easier.  \u201cI can crank out a blog post in, you know, 45 minutes now, as opposed to three hours. It's insane,\u201d he said. \n\nBut Ryan does worry. At times, he said, he could not help but feel that the entrance of ChatGPT into the marketing sector felt like the insertion of the modern loom into the textile industry. \n\n\u201cIt's gonna be one loom operator, as opposed to, you know, 100 weavers,\u201d he said.\n\nTAGGED:\nOPENAIAIARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCEOVEREMPLOYED\nORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.\nYour email address\nYour Email:\nSubscribe\nBy signing up, you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy & to receive electronic communications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content.\n\nMORE\nFROM VICE\nTech\nReddit Moderators Brace for a ChatGPT Spam Apocalypse\nLAURIE CLARKE\n04.11.23\n\nTech\nFounder: You'll Soon Be Able to Talk to Your Dead Mom In the Metaverse Thanks to ChatGPT\n<PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>\n02.01.23\n\nTech\nFor the Love of God, AI Chatbots Can\u2019t \u2018Decide\u2019 to Do Anything\nJANUS ROSE\n03.28.23\n\nTech\nSomeone Asked an Autonomous AI to 'Destroy Humanity': This Is What Happened\nJASON KOEBLER\n04.07.23\n\nTech\nChatGPT Can Replace the Underpaid Workers Who Train AI, Researchers Say\nCHLOE XIANG\n03.29.23\n\nTech\nGoogle's AI Explains Google's Monopolistic Practices in Great Detail\nCHLOE XIANG\n03.22.23\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nABOUT\nJOBS\nPARTNER\nVICE VOICES\nCONTENT FUNDING ON VICE\nSECURITY POLICY\nPRIVACY & TERMS\nACCESSIBILITY STATEMENT\n\u00a9 2023 VICE MEDIA GROUP"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Overemployed workers are using OpenAI's ChatGPT to take on multiple full-time jobs simultaneously.

step-by-step instructions. DoNotPay CEO Joshua Browder shared his own experience of the same on Twitter.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDivyanshi Sharma\n<PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>\nNew Delhi,UPDATED: Apr 3, 2023 12:16 IST\n\nIn Short\nChatGPT helped DoNotPay CEO Joshua Browder recover money.\nThe CEO got around USD 200.\nHe shared the experience on Twitter.\nBy Divyanshi Sharma: Ever wondered how nice it would be if you could just sit at home and had some money coming your way? Well, ChatGPT might be able to help you with that. Now it won't exactly 'make it rain' as AI isn't that magical, but the viral chatbot can surely help you recover money if you have unclaimed receipts and didn't know about them until now. In other words, ChatGPT can help you recover money that you, for some reason, might have not claimed yet.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nChatGPT helps recover money\nThe CEO of DoNotPay, Joshua Browder, shared his experience of recovering over USD 200 (Rs 16,480) with the help of ChatGPT's browsing extension. He asked ChatGPT if it could 'find him some money' and the AI chatbot obliged. Within minutes, Browder got USD 210 from the California Government. It is to be noted that these were unclaimed receipts that Browder hadn't collected in the past. Browder elaborated on his experience in a Twitter thread.\n\n\nElaborating on the experience, Browder revealed in the same Twitter thread that the chatbot first came up with the idea of visiting a website called 'California State Controller'. \"This website holds unclaimed refunds from companies that can't contact you. It gave me a link with step by step instructions on what to do,\" the young entrepreneur wrote.\n\n\"I followed the instructions and, sure enough, $209.67 was waiting for me, one minute later,\" he added.\n\n\nAmit\nMUST READ\nWhy Amit Shah is visiting Mamata's state on eve of Bengali New Year's Day\n\nTRENDING TOPICS\nIPL 2023\nKarnataka Polls\nAmritpal Singh\nRahul Gandhi\nTech Layoffs\nWhen ChatGPT got superpowers\nOpenAI introduced ChatGPT\u2019s successor, the GPT-4 to the world last month and it proved to be capable of doing much more than its predecessor. From taking various exams with exceptional performance to being able to handle more complex tasks, the GPT-4 soon became the talk of the town. With the launch of GPT-4, OpenAI also made it possible for the chatbot to accept images as inputs and generate the output accordingly.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s blog post introducing GPT-4 read, \u201cWe\u2019ve created GPT-4, the latest milestone in OpenAI\u2019s effort in scaling up deep learning. GPT-4 is a large multimodal model (accepting image and text inputs, emitting text outputs) that, while less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks.\u201d\n\nThe company also released a list of exams that the new GPT-4 has passed and shared its scores as well. For instance, the language model passed LSAT with 88 percentile and SAT Math with 89 percentile. It also passed GRE Quantitative exam with 80th percentile and GRE verbal and writing exams with 99th and 54th percentile.\n\nWhen ChatGPT was initially rolled out to the public in November 2022, it was a free-for-all model. Gradually, a premium version of the chatbot became available and is called the ChatGPT Plus. Currently, only people who have ChatGPT Plus can experience the new GPT-4.\n\n--- ENDS ---\nALSO READ | Italy bans ChatGPT over privacy concerns, here is everything we know\nALSO READ | Fake WhatsApp message claims government is offering free phone recharge to users, do not fall for it\nALSO READ | Sundar Pichai says Google's ChatGPT rival Bard will get upgrades and show progress soon\n\nEdited By:\nDivyanshi Sharma\nPublished On:\nApr 3, 2023\nWatch Live TV\nFollow Us On:\nDOWNLOAD APP\nAndriod App\nios App\nSmartTv App\nABOUT US\nCONTACT US\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\nARCHIVES\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 Living Media India Limited.

and\n0:06\nit\u2019s already changing the World by\n0:07\nwriting books that are being sold on\n0:09\nAmazon creating super popular tweets for\n0:11\ninfluencers and even writing and passing\n0:13\nUniversity exams so I decided to push it\n0:16\nto the limits and find the top 10 best\n0:17\nthings you can do with it that\u2019ll change\n0:19\nyour life\nAsk it to Summarise\n0:21\n[Music]\n0:23\nso to get started open your browser and\n0:25\nhead on over to\n0:27\nchat.openai.com It\u2019ll ask you to sign up\n0:29\nso just pop in your details and then\n0:31\nyou\u2019re pretty much good to go and one of\n0:33\nthe first powerful things you\u2019ve got to\n0:35\ndo with it is ask it to summarize things\n0:37\nlike if you have a web link to a super\n0:39\nlong article that you don\u2019t necessarily\n0:41\nwant to spend your time reading you can\n0:43\ngo ahead copy that link and then hop\n0:45\ninto chat GPT and actually ask it to\n0:48\nsummarize this article for you in one\n0:50\nsentence then just paste the link and\n0:52\nwatch the magic happen as chat gbt does\n0:54\nan incredible job at summarizing what\n0:56\nwould have been a fairly long article to\n0:58\nread into a couple of sentences that you\n1:00\ncan read in seconds but what really blew\n1:03\nmy mind is you can ask it to summarize\n1:05\nYouTube videos and this is really useful\n1:07\nespecially when the videos along like\n1:08\nthis podcast which was an hour and 12\n1:10\nminutes all you do is select the link\n1:12\nhit that copy button and once again in\n1:15\nchat gbt ask it to summarize this video\n1:18\nthen paste the link but importantly head\n1:20\non back to YouTube video and also copy\n1:22\nthe title then paste that title just\n1:25\nbelow the link it\u2019s not gonna lie\n1:26\nwithout using the title you can\n1:28\nsometimes get some mixed results but\n1:30\nonce again instantly it gives you a\n1:32\nsummary of what was actually in the\n1:33\nvideo without having to spend an hour\n1:35\nand 12 minutes where things get really\n1:37\ncrazy is it can summarize hundreds of\n1:40\npages in seconds so again instead of\n1:42\nspending hours of reading through files\n1:44\nor documents you can literally just copy\n1:47\nthe pages of text then go into chat GPT\n1:49\nand type out tldr too long didn\u2019t read\n1:53\nthen just ask it to summarize in two\n1:55\nsweet sentences for you paste all those\n1:57\npages of text and watch as this bad boy\n2:00\nspits out the quickest summary you\u2019ve\n2:02\never seen and what\u2019s crazy is just how\n2:04\nfast it can do it another thing you can\n2:07\ndo is if you\u2019re on your phone with the\n2:08\nsame web link you can ask chat GPT to\n2:11\nsummarize or explain something that went\n2:13\non in the news or old history and it\u2019ll\n2:15\nmake it so much quicker and easier to\n2:17\nunderstand but that is just the start\n2:19\nthere is so much more you can do with it\n2:21\nlike it can teach you pretty much\n2:22\nanything\nAsk it to Teach\n2:25\nnow let\u2019s say you wanted to learn\n2:27\nsomething really quickly well instead of\n2:29\nsearching through Google or going\n2:30\nthrough manuals you can ask chatgpt to\n2:32\nteach you whatever it is you want and\n2:34\namazingly it actually gives you a really\n2:36\ndetailed guide and step by step on how\n2:38\nto get started it told me the chord what\n2:41\nfret and even what string I needed to\n2:43\nput my finger on to get started with\n2:44\nplaying guitar and from what I tested it\n2:46\nalso does a really good job at teaching\n2:48\nyou different languages and even certain\n2:51\nsoftware like Photoshop and remember\n2:53\nwhat\u2019s totally wild is this is all for\n2:55\nfree and what\u2019s also so crazy is if\n2:57\nyou\u2019re stuck on a project or some super\n2:59\nannoying math homework you can just put\n3:01\nit into chat GPT and ask it to solve it\n3:03\nfor you honestly I wish I had this when\n3:05\nI was back in school because it explains\n3:07\neverything you need to know convenient\n3:10\nand after all that you can still then\n3:12\nask it to check your project or even\n3:14\ngrade your homework for you so for\n3:17\nexample you could ask it to grade your\n3:18\npaper out of 100 and the BAM not only\n3:21\ndoes it grade your homework or project\n3:23\nbut it even gives you a reason as to why\n3:25\nit gave that so I mean you can turn\n3:27\nchatibility into teach GPT but you can\n3:31\nalso turn it into dark GPT\nGet Healthy\n3:35\nokay so of course chat GPT is not a real\n3:38\ndoctor but it can help you get really\n3:40\nhealthy and this seriously blew my mind\n3:43\nso let\u2019s just say you want to get fit\n3:45\nhealthy gain some muscle and maybe lose\n3:47\nsome weight you can ask it for a\n3:48\ndetailed exercise plan and honestly it\n3:51\ngives some great advice and an amazing\n3:53\nplan to follow and if this isn\u2019t\n3:54\ndetailed enough for you remember you can\n3:56\nask it to get even more specific but we\n3:59\ncan take this one step further and ask\n4:01\nChachi BT to make a weekly meal plan for\n4:04\nyou with a calorie allowance and look at\n4:07\nhow detailed it can get you can then ask\n4:09\nit to take that meal plan and break it\n4:11\ndown into a freaking shopping list for\n4:13\nyou and what really blew my mind is how\n4:15\nit categorized all the different\n4:16\ningredients but pretty life-changing\n4:19\nwhat you can also ask it to do is come\n4:21\nup with a great recipe for you based on\n4:23\nwhat couple food items you have at home\n4:25\nso for example if you only have a couple\n4:27\ningredients laying around you can ask\n4:28\nchat GPT what you can cook with these\n4:31\ningredients and it\u2019ll actually generate\n4:32\ndifferent recipes for you or you can\n4:34\neven ask it for a recipe on a specific\n4:37\nmeal like let\u2019s say you were allergic to\n4:39\nnuts or maybe you wanted a vegan Mac and\n4:41\ncheeks so charge EBT can turn into a lot\n4:43\nof things but it can also turn into a\n4:46\nyou\nWrite Like You\n4:49\nit is so wild that it can even do this\n4:52\nbut let\u2019s just say you copied a message\n4:54\nor email that you\u2019ve written and head\n4:56\ninto chatgpt you can ask it to analyze a\n4:59\nmessage and learn to write like you\n5:01\nit\u2019ll ask you to paste in exactly what\n5:03\nmessage or mail you\u2019ve written so it can\n5:05\nlearn from it and once you do it\u2019s\n5:07\nabsolutely insane and what it picks up\n5:09\nand how accurate it is for example I\n5:11\nhave a casual way of speaking I like to\n5:13\nuse these words and I have some humor in\n5:15\nmy writing not wrong this is kind of\n5:18\nlike making an AI clone of yourself and\n5:20\nit\u2019s actually pretty useful especially\n5:22\nwhen you need chat GPT to write and\n5:24\nreply for you people will literally\n5:26\nthink you wrote everything and if that\n5:29\ndoesn\u2019t blow your mind then check this\n5:30\nout you can paste anything into chat GPT\n5:33\nand ask it to rewrite it in a person\u2019s\n5:35\nstyle like Snoop Dogg for example this\n5:38\nwas honestly hilarious and I also\n5:39\ncouldn\u2019t believe at how well it rewroted\n5:42\nin his style theyo\u2019s world all the way\n5:44\nbut what\u2019s even better is you can assign\n5:46\npersonas\n5:48\nand what\u2019s crazy is it\u2019ll give you\n5:50\nbetter responses when it\u2019s in that\n5:52\ncharacter you do just have to prompt\n5:54\nchat GPT to pretend to be the specific\n5:57\nperson but then after that every time\n5:59\nyou chat to it it\u2019ll respond like that\n6:01\nperson would whether it\u2019s Snoop Dogg\n6:03\nOprah Winfrey or Abraham Lincoln the\n6:05\noptions are honestly endless and this\n6:07\ncan actually be so useful especially\n6:10\nwhen you need to ask chatgpt for some\n6:12\nadvice\nAsk for Advice\n6:16\nso let\u2019s just say you needed some advice\n6:18\nbecause your roommate kept stealing your\n6:20\nbananas well you can ask chat GPT to\n6:23\nhelp you out and somehow the advice it\n6:25\ngives is so balanced and reasonable it\u2019s\n6:27\nas if you\u2019re talking to a professional\n6:29\nyou can literally ask it for any advice\n6:31\nlike how to deal with a tricky situation\n6:33\nor how to impress your in-laws or get a\n6:36\nraise at work literally anything you can\n6:39\neven ask it how to respond to Something\n6:41\nin tricky situations like if your boss\n6:43\nor co-worker sent you a nasty message\n6:45\nall you need to do is paste in the\n6:47\nmessage they sent you then ask chargpt\n6:50\nfor some help and advice and probably\n6:52\none of my favorite things is it\u2019ll even\n6:54\nwrite a response for you neat\nScan Images\n7:00\nnow another amazing thing chat GPT can\n7:02\ndo is actually scan images so let\u2019s just\n7:04\nsay you had a complex diagram or\n7:06\nintricate chart you could just copy the\n7:08\nlink to that image go into chatgpt and\n7:11\nask it to describe what is in this image\n7:13\nthen just paste the link to it and in a\n7:15\ncouple of seconds it\u2019ll explain and\n7:17\ndescribe exactly what is happening in\n7:19\nthis pick and sometimes it does get the\n7:21\nexplanation completely wrong but if you\n7:24\ndo give it a bit more information it\n7:25\nshould get it right on the second try\n7:28\nforeign\n7:30\nthing you might not have thought to do\n7:32\nwith chat GPT is actually ask you to\n7:34\nplan out a holiday for you it\u2019ll give\n7:36\nyou a day-to-day itinerary of things you\n7:38\ncan do while on your trip and you can\n7:40\neven ask it to get more specific and\n7:42\nprovide options for flights something\n7:43\nelse I actually really like using it for\n7:45\nis movie and book recommendations so you\n7:48\ncan ask it like what were the top comedy\n7:49\nmovies in the 90s it\u2019ll give you a list\n7:52\njust choose one then sit back relax and\n7:54\nenjoy then something else I really like\n7:56\nusing it for is taking these super\n7:57\ncomplicated formal agreements and making\n8:00\nthem more informal and actually\n8:01\nunderstandable so again you just copy\n8:04\nand paste the text ask it to make it\n8:05\ninformal so that finally you can\n8:07\nactually understand it but now let\u2019s get\n8:09\nour game on with chat GPT because\n8:11\nbelieve it or not you can actually play\n8:13\ngames with it\nGames\n8:16\nokay so if you open up chat GPT and ask\n8:19\nit what games you can play with it it\u2019ll\n8:22\ngive you a whole list of different\n8:23\noptions to choose from but one of my\n8:24\nfavorite has got to be trivia and that\n8:26\nis because if you use this prompt over\n8:28\nhere you can play any trivia game you\n8:30\nwant with it so I mean if you wanted to\n8:32\nyou could play Tech trivia movie trivia\n8:34\nor even something as crazy as cheese\n8:36\ntrivia but you can take things to\n8:38\nanother level and ask chat GPT to code a\n8:42\ngame for you which you can then play in\n8:44\nyour browser it does take a few steps to\n8:46\nget this right but you can ask chat GPT\n8:48\nthe entire way on how to do this but I\n8:50\nmean the fact that it can literally make\n8:52\na game from scratch is just whoa and if\n8:55\nall that was enough you can even play\n8:57\ntext Adventure Games with it like\n8:58\nDungeons and Dragons I personally don\u2019t\n9:00\nplay Dungeons and Dragons but you gotta\n9:02\nadmit it\u2019s pretty crazy that I can make\n9:04\na completely original story for you from\n9:07\nabsolutely nothing\n9:09\noh\nBetter Responses\n9:11\nnow to get better responses the best\n9:13\nthing to do is to pretend as though\n9:15\nyou\u2019re talking to a real person if you\n9:17\nare something simple like what\u2019s one\n9:18\nplus one you\u2019ll get a simple answer but\n9:20\nthe more details you are in your\n9:22\nquestions like why exactly does one plus\n9:24\none equal two the more detailed and\n9:26\ninformative its responses the second\n9:28\nthing to do for better responses is\n9:30\nalways correct chat gbt when you think\n9:32\nit\u2019s made a mistake I asked it who\n9:34\nHale\u2019s world was and let\u2019s just say it\n9:36\ngot it totally wrong so as you go the\n9:39\nmore you correct it the more it can\n9:40\nlearn from its mistakes and hopefully\n9:42\njust not make them again then also don\u2019t\n9:45\nforget something else you can do is\n9:46\nassign personas wherever you can because\n9:49\nevery chat GPT personality you assign it\n9:51\ncan actually give you a different\n9:53\nresponse and the crazy thing is don\u2019t\n9:55\nask me how some personalities even give\n9:58\nyou better responses than others\nOriginal Content\n10:03\nnow if all that wasn\u2019t enough don\u2019t\n10:05\nforget that chat GPT can create\n10:07\ncompletely original content like write a\n10:10\nsong for you about aliens that make bad\n10:11\njokes create an Instagram caption write\n10:14\nyour best math speech that you\u2019ve only\n10:15\nknown for one week the options of\n10:17\ncontent it can create for you are\n10:19\nabsolutely unlimited and I mean you\n10:21\ncould even take a job description with\n10:23\nall its information pop that into chat\n10:25\nGPT and ask it to write a one-page cover\n10:28\nletter for you so if you think about it\n10:30\nwhen it comes to content creation the\n10:32\nsky is the absolute limit and believe it\n10:35\nor not I actually use chat gbt to write\n10:37\nthis entire video I\u2019m just kidding but\n10:40\nmost of it\n10:41\nso if you think about it this is only\n10:44\nthe beginning and AI is only going to\n10:46\nget better so hit that sub button if you\n10:49\nwant to see some more cool things you\n10:50\ncan do with AI otherwise I\u2019ll see

It is powerful, versatile, and easy to use for a wide range of applications. In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of using ChatGPT, covering key aspects such as setting up an API key, formatting prompts, and examining the output. Let's jump in!\n\n1. Obtain an API Key:\nTo start using ChatGPT, sign up on the OpenAI platform to acquire an API key. This key is essential to access ChatGPT and use it for various applications.\n\n- Go to OpenAI's website (https://beta.openai.com/signup/) and sign up for an account.\n- After signing up, log in and navigate to the API Key section.\n- Generate your unique API Key and store it safely, as it will be required for any interaction with ChatGPT.\n\n2. Set Up Your Environment:\nDepending on your preferred programming language or environment, you may need to install an OpenAI library, such as the OpenAI Python library.\n\nFor Python, install the library by running:\n```\npip install openai\n```\n\nAfter installing the required library, import it in your project and configure your API Key as follows:\n\n```python\nimport openai\n\nopenai.api_key = \"your_api_key_here\"\n```\n\nReplace \"your_api_key_here\" with the actual API key you acquired in step 1.\n\n3. Compose a Prompts:\nChatGPT requires a prompt to generate a response. A prompt can be a simple question, a statement, or even a series of dialogues or text. Spend some time crafting a well-phrased prompt to obtain better results from the model.\n\nExample of a single question prompt:\n```\n\"What are the health benefits of regular exercise?\"\n```\n\nExample of a dialog with multiple user inputs:\n```\n[\n  {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an assistant that provides information about famous landmarks.\"},\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Tell me about the Eiffel Tower.\"},\n  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The Eiffel Tower is a ...\"},\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"How tall is it?\"}\n]\n\n```\n\n4. Make an API Call:\nUse your preferred programming language to make an API call to ChatGPT with your prompt. In Python, you can use the following example code:\n\n```python\nimport openai\n\nopenai.api_key = \"your_api_key_here\"\n\nresponse = openai.Completion.create(\n  engine=\"text-davinci-002\",\n  prompt=\"Your prompt here\",\n  max_tokens=100,\n  n=1,\n  stop=None,\n  temperature=0.5\n)\n```\n\nReplace \"Your prompt here\" with the prompt you composed in step 3.\n\nYou can also customize different parameters in the API call such as:\n- `max_tokens`: Maximum number of tokens in the response output.\n- `n`: Number of responses to generate.\n- `stop`: Token(s) that, when encountered, will signal the end of the response generation.\n- `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output. Higher values (e.g., 1.0) yield more random output, while lower values (e.g., 0.1) produce more focused and deterministic output.\n\n5. Analyze the Output:\nAfter receiving the response from the API call, you can retrieve the generated text and analyze it. In Python, you can use the following code to extract the output:\n\n```python\ngenerated_text = response.choices[0].text.strip()\nprint(generated_text)\n```\n\nThis code will display the AI-generated text based on your provided prompt.\n\nConclusion:\nNow you are ready to harness the power of ChatGPT for your projects. By following this tutorial, you can successfully set up your environment, craft effective prompts, and interact with the ChatGPT API to generate meaningful and contextually relevant text. Experiment with different settings and prompts for various applications and discover what ChatGPT can do for you!"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I thought you can use it online?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, you can use ChatGPT online through the OpenAI platform or third-party applications, such as the OpenAI Playground, without any setup or programming.\n\nHere's how to use ChatGPT online using the OpenAI Playground:\n\n1. Visit the OpenAI Playground at https://platform.openai.com/playground\n2. Sign up or log in to your OpenAI account.\n3. Once you are logged in, you will see a page with a text input area and various settings.\n4. From the \"Model\" dropdown, select the desired ChatGPT model, such as \"gpt-3.5-turbo.\"\n5. Type your prompt or question into the text input area.\n6. Configure optional settings, such as \"Temperature\" (to control the randomness of the generated text) or \"Tokens\" (to limit the length of the output).\n7. Click on the \"Run\" button, and the generated response will appear on the right side of the screen.\n\nKeep in mind that while it is convenient, the OpenAI Playground does not provide the full range of customization options available through the API.

"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In today's fast-paced world, salespeople are constantly looking for ways to improve their productivity and close more deals. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), salespeople can now use ChatGPT3/4, a language generation model that can produce human-like text, to revolutionize their daily work. In this article, we will dive deeper into the various ways ChatGPT3/4 can be leveraged by salespeople to enhance their productivity and conversions.\n\n1. Generating Outreach Emails\n\nAs a sales rep, you know how crucial it is to draft a compelling outreach email that captures the prospect's attention and exudes personalization, context, and value. However, writing such emails can be a daunting task, especially when you're pressed for time or lack inspiration. With ChatGPT3/4, sales reps can now generate outreach emails with minimal effort and time.\n\nTo start with, you can provide the AI model with basic details such as the prospective customer's name, business, and industry. The model can then leverage this information to generate personalized, high-quality outreach emails that align with your sales objectives. ChatGPT3/4 can analyze the customer's persona and generate language that resonates with them, fostering a stronger connection and potential deal.\n\n2. Streamlining Lead Qualification\n\nOne of the biggest challenges that sales reps are faced with is qualifying leads. It is time-consuming and often distracts sales teams from other essential tasks. However, with ChatGPT3/4, sales reps can efficiently qualify leads and channel their time and resources towards high-quality prospects. \n\nChatGPT3/4 can analyze incoming leads and categorize them based on their readiness to buy, interest in the product/service, budget, and other essential criteria. This categorization enables sales reps to prioritize leads based on the level of personalization and attention required for nurturing. Additionally, the AI model can also generate personalized follow-up emails based on the customer's requirement or existing interaction, further streamlining the qualification process.\n\n3. Enhancing Customer Engagement\n\nIn today's digital age, customers expect personalization in every interaction they have with a company. Sales reps must use high-levels of personalization with customers to entice them better to take the next step in completing the sale. This is where ChatGPT3/4 can assist sales reps to build a better relationship with prospects and improve the chances of closing deals.\n\nUsing language models, ChatGPT3/4 can help sales reps analyze a customer's data and past purchases to identify areas of interest or content that will resonate with them. Based on this data, the AI model can then craft personalized answers or solutions that will engage the customer and draw them closer to a purchase. This level of personalization fosters stronger customer relationships, ultimately leading to better sales.\n\n4. Augmenting Sales Proposals\n\nSales proposals are the crux of sales deals, and a weak proposal can make or break a deal. Crafting the perfect proposal takes time, effort, and a deep understanding of the customer's requirements. By leveraging ChatGPT3/4, sales reps can create proposals that are not only personalized but also showcase strong value propositions.\n\nChatGPT3/4 can analyze the customer's requirements, profile, and preferences to generate a precise and data-rich proposal. The AI model can also suggest content or even modifying the proposals based on past-successful campaigns. By presenting a proposal with more personalization and better value, sales reps can augment their chances of winning the deal, and probably cause more upsell in the future.\n\n5. Improving Customer Service through Smart Responses\n\nTalking to potential clients and answering their queries can be a daunting task, especially when you are dealing with a high volume of queries. With ChatGPT3/4, sales reps can now improve their customer service response rates and, in turn, deliver a better customer experience.\n\nUsing ChatGPT3/4, sales reps can create a repository of pre-drafted responses to frequently asked questions. The chatbot can handle simple queries and less time-consuming tasks like FAQ\u2019s about the product or shipping. ChatGPT3/4 can also suggest responses or routes for the customer based on their questions that will take them closer to a sale. Additionally, the AI model can also identify and escalate more complex queries that require human intervention, further improving the overall customer experience.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, ChatGPT3/4 presents a significant opportunity for salespeople to improve their productivity and sales outcomes in unprecedented ways. Sales rep's can tap into ChatGPT3/4's potential to streamline and automate various sales processes such as generating personalized outreach emails, qualifying leads, enhancing customer engagement, augmenting sales proposals, and improving customer service. Using the right AI tools, sales teams can streamline their processes, stand out in their communication, and ultimately close stronger deals. Whether you are a B2B or a B2C salesperson, ChatGPT3/4 AI can help you decrease the time spent on repetitive tasks and increase the time spent on meaningful ones that result in closed deals, happy customers, and a fuller bottom line."}]}, {"facetValue": "troubleshoot issues with the ChatGPT application.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "understand why their ChatGPT is experiencing errors."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "troubleshoot issues with the ChatGPT application."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u6211\u7684chatgpt\u7528\u6ca1\u591a\u4e45\u5c31\u62a5\u9519"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u4ee5\u4e0b\u539f\u56e0\uff1a\n\n1. \u7f51\u7edc\u8fde\u63a5\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6216\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\uff0c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4ChatGPT\u65e0\u6cd5\u6b63\u5e38\u8fd0\u884c\u3002\n\n2. \u670d\u52a1\u5668\u95ee\u9898\uff1aChatGPT\u662f\u5728\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u51fa\u73b0\u6545\u969c\u6216\u7ef4\u62a4\uff0c\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4ChatGPT\u65e0\u6cd5\u6b63\u5e38\u8fd0\u884c\u3002\n\n3. \u8f93\u5165\u9519\u8bef\uff1a\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u8f93\u5165\u4e86\u65e0\u6548\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\uff0cChatGPT\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u9519\u8bef\u3002\n\n4.

Go to \"Campaigns\" in the main menu.\n2. Click on \"New Campaign\" to create a new campaign.\n3. Name your campaign and fill out the necessary information, then click \"Create Campaign.\"\n4. Inside the campaign builder, click on \"Add Trigger\" and choose the trigger that fits your needs, such as \"New Lead Created\" or any other event that will initiate the email being sent.\n5. Once the trigger is set, click on \"Add Action\" and choose the \"Send Email\" action.\n6. You can choose to send the email from the connected email address in the \"From\" field.\n7. In the \u201cTo\u201d field, type in your email address and your agents' email addresses; separate multiple email addresses with a comma (e.g., you@example.com, agent1@example.com, agent2@example.com).\n8. Fill out the \"Subject\" and \"Body\" fields according to the information you want to include in the email you'll receive. You can use tags, images, and HTML formatting to personalize the email.\n9. Click on \"Save\" to save the email action within the campaign.\n10. After you have created the automation, every time the selected trigger occurs, an email notification will be sent to you and your agents' inboxes.\n\nKeep in mind that these instructions will only enable you to receive emails from the GoHighLevel platform.

Start by creating a new Android Studio project and setting it up with the necessary dependencies, such as the GPT chatbot API.\n\n2. Define the UI elements of the app, such as the rainbow animation and main story selection page, using XML layout files. Add buttons and input fields for the user to choose their character, settings, and genre preferences.\n\n3. Use Java code to handle user input and call the appropriate GPT chatbot API function to generate the story. Use Async/await to ensure that the app doesn't freeze while waiting for the chatbot to return a response.\n\n4. To minimize the risk of retain cycles and objects dropping out of memory, make sure to properly manage memory within the app. Use lifecycle-aware components, such as ViewModel and LiveData, to ensure that data is not retained beyond the lifecycle of the app's components.\n\n5. Test the app thoroughly, making sure to handle edge cases such as invalid user input or chatbot errors.\n\nHere is pseudocode for the main logic of the app:\n\n```\nclass StorytellingActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\n  \n  // Define UI elements\n  private Button adventureButton;\n  private EditText characterInput;\n  private EditText settingInput;\n  \n  // Call this method when the \"adventure\" button is clicked\n  private void onAdventureButtonClick() {\n    // Get user input\n    String character = characterInput.getText().toString();\n    String setting = settingInput.getText().toString();\n    \n    // Call GPT chatbot API to generate story\n    String story = await GPTChatbot.generateStory(character, setting, \"adventure\");\n    \n    // Display story to user\n    showStory(story);\n  }\n  \n  // Display the given story to the user\n  private void showStory(String story) {\n    // TODO: Display story in a new activity or dialog box\n  }\n  \n  // Override lifecycle methods to properly manage memory\n  // TODO: Implement lifecycle-aware components\n  \n}\n```\n\nNote: This pseudocode is simplified and does not include error handling or other necessary details.

I got side track but I know how to build an app now and I have an idea for one!! using chat gpt to create bed time stories for V ! she will chose the characters genera and setting and chat gpt will create the story since its super good at that ..I have a prompt to help me write the code which I got chat gpt to make it better lol.. ive pieced it together from all the videos I been watching this past week so technically I can do this \u2026 I used a free version of chatgpt 3.5 to do this pretty legit a but limited in customization but I now have a reason to cough up the 20 bucks to get the legit version for gpt 4 to help me write the code and intergrate it into the app with the api key plus the 25 bucks to get a google play console account to publish it on the app store. I think its doable and the idea is not too complicated basicly its like using chat gpt now you tell it create a kids story of a bear in san quintin looking for ice cream that get the help of a girl named v ...actually ...damn you can do that now \u2026.im just putting it in an app ...I guess because thats what every one else is essentially doing just inseting chat gpt in things and calling it there own ai but really its just chat gpt doing every thing.. hmmmmmmmmmmmm  well damn \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.well the prompt look good and should work.. id just have to think a bit more how the app would look and how v would interact with it I was thinking options with pictures of the characters adventures and settings predetermined and chat gpt would generate a different and original story each time no mater if the selections were the same figured that be easier to code than typing it out for her and she could chose it her self . maybe a section where the parent could go in and change the characters setting and adventure type by typing different ones? its all a matter of describing it to the ai a botton for characters will give you pictures of a bear a zombie a pony for the main character a picture designating the adventure type ect.. then GPT would recognize that as creat a fun creative story about ( chosen character)  in blank setting \u2026.. all this would run in the background V would only see three dots then the story starts generating and the story would have to be read to her easier than having to intergrate something to read it out loud like gooogle assistant would \u2026\u2026\u2026 okay maybe I haven't flusked out the app idea enough \u2026 I jumped the gun as per usual \u2026 but check out the prompt Im thinking this could be better reading it over \u2026...I\u2019m looking to build an interactive kids storytelling app in Java for Android 12 in a single code file.

I got sidetracked, but I now know how to build an app, and I have an idea for one - using chat GPT to create customized bedtime stories for V. She can choose the characters, genre, and setting, and chat GPT will generate a story since it's particularly good at that. I have a prompt that helps me write the code, which I got chat GPT to improve. By piecing together everything from the videos I've been watching this past week, I think I can do this. I used a free version of chat GPT 3.5 for this, which is pretty legit but limited in customization. I now have a reason to buy the legit version for GPT 4 to help me write the code and integrate it into the app with the API key, and then spend $25 to get a Google Play Console account to publish it on the app store. I think it's doable, and the idea itself isn't too complicated - it's like using chat GPT to create a kids' story about a bear in San Quintin who is searching for ice cream with V's help. Actually... you can do that now... I'm simply putting it into an app. I guess everyone is essentially doing the same thing - inserting chat GPT into things and calling it their own AI, but really, it's just chat GPT doing everything.\n\nThe prompt looks good and should work. I just have to think a bit more about how the app would look and how V would interact with it. I was thinking about having options with pictures of the characters' adventures and predetermined settings, and chat GPT would generate a different and original story each time, regardless of whether the selections were the same. I figured that would be easier to code than typing it out for her, and she could choose it herself. Maybe there could be a section where the parent could go in and change the characters' settings and adventure type by typing in different ones? It's just a matter of describing it to the AI \u2014 a button for characters would give you pictures of a bear, a zombie, a pony, etc. for the main character, along with a picture designating the adventure type, etc. Then, GPT would recognize that and create a fun, creative story about the chosen character in a blank setting. All of this could run in the background, and V would only see three dots, after which the story would start generating, and it would have to be read to her since it would be easier than integrating something to read it out loud, like Google Assistant.\n\nOkay, maybe I haven't fleshed out the app idea enough; I jumped the gun, as per usual. But check out the prompt - I'm thinking this could be better by reading it over. I'm looking to build an interactive kids' storytelling app in Java for Android 12 in a single code file. The app will use chat GPT to create a unique and creative story that a 5-year-old would find entertaining. It will take the user's preferences for characters, settings, and genres and generate the story. I want to use Async/await, and I would like you to show me step-by-step how to build and output the code in pseudocode with minimal prose. I want to minimize the risk of retain cycles and objects dropping out of memory. If a requirement is not technically possible, please let me know. Also, if you make changes to the code you previously gave me, please only provide me with the updated changes.\n\nPlus, I have to describe the app I need to work on to add to the prompt so chat GPT 4 can write the code for that, like the buttons and the characters and settings it would show... Damn, okay, so maybe I'm not quite there yet, but it's starting to sound unique again. You open the app, and a rainbow appears across the screen displaying, \"It's Story Time!\" It then takes you to the main page \"\u00bfQu\u00e9 tipo de historia quieres?\" where you have adventure selections; (what kinds? Ask V). Once you select this, you will be asked to choose the characters. Should there be an option for conflict? Does it need to have a plot? Or does the user choose the setting, and chat GPT would take these inputs and insert them in designated slots within a predetermined prompt that says, \"Create a creative kids story about (kid's character selection)\" - the same for the adventure type (and setting). Create a simple, entertaining plot for a 5-year-old with a happy ending. Okay, this needs a lot of work. I need to imagine and describe what the app would look like and how it would function. Okay, the prompt needs more work...

In this example, we'll use the OpenAI Python library to interact with the OpenAI API. You can modify this outline to add more features and functionality as needed.\n\n1. Set up your environment:\n\n- Make sure Python 3.x is installed.\n- Create a virtual environment to separate your application dependencies from the system.\n- Install the required packages (flask, openai, etc.) in your virtual environment.\n\n2. Get your OpenAI API key:\n\n- Sign up on the OpenAI platform (https://beta.openai.com/signup) if you haven't already.\n- Obtain your API key from the OpenAI platform.\n\n3. Create the application structure:\n\n- Create a folder for your application.\n- Within the folder, create the following files: app.py, templates/, and static/ (for CSS, JS, etc.).\n\n4. Install required libraries:\n\nFor this application, we need the following Python libraries, which can be installed using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install Flask\npip install openai\n```\n\n5.

Run the application:\n\n```bash\npython app.py\n```\n\nYour application should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Users can enter their goals, and the chatbot will provide guidance on achieving those goals using GPT-3.5.\n\nRemember to replace \"your_openai_api_key\" with your own API key.

You can send text prompts or questions to GPT-3 through the API, and receive responses from the model in return. To keep the chat session going, you can keep sending prompts and receiving responses until either the user or model decides to end the conversation.\n\nTo maintain the context of the chat session, you can use some form of session ID to keep track of the conversation history. You can store the session ID on the user's device or server, and use it to retrieve context and conversation history from previous interactions. This will help ensure that the conversation flows smoothly and seamlessly, with each response building on the previous one.\n\nIn summary, using the OpenAI API to chat with GPT-3 and maintain a chat session involves sending requests to the API endpoint, receiving responses from the model, and using a session ID to keep track of the conversation history."}]}, {"facetValue": "demonstrate how to set up and use the OpenAI API to facilitate a chat session with GPT-3 while maintaining context.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "set up a chat session using OpenAI's API key to communicate with GPT-3 and keep track of the conversation."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "demonstrate how to set up and use the OpenAI API to facilitate a chat session with GPT-3 while maintaining context."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "3"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How to use openai api key to chat with chatgpt 3.5 and keep chat session, should i use some id or something else?

Install the `openai` Python package using pip:\n\n```\npip install openai\n```\n\n2. Set up the OpenAI API key by creating a `.env` file in your project directory and adding the following line with your API key:\n\n```\nOPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key-here>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable directly in your code.\n\n3. Write a Python script to initialize the OpenAI API client, set up a chat session, and send messages to the API to get responses from GPT-3. Here is an example script:\n\n```\nimport openai\nimport os\n\n# Initialize OpenAI API client\nopenai.api_key = os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")\nmodel_engine = \"text-davinci-002\"\nprompt = \"Let's chat!\"\nchat_log = \"\"\n\n# Main loop to keep the chat session going\nwhile True:\n    # Get user input\n    message = input(\"> \")\n\n    # Add user message to chat log\n    chat_log += message + \"\\n\"\n\n    # Send chat log to OpenAI API\n    response = openai.Completion.create(\n        engine=model_engine,\n        prompt=prompt + \"\\n\" + chat_log,\n        temperature=0.7,\n        max_tokens=2048,\n        top_p=1,\n        frequency_penalty=0,\n        presence_penalty=0\n    )\n\n    # Get AI response\n    ai_message = response.choices[0].text.strip()\n\n    # Print AI response and add to chat log\n    print(ai_message)\n    chat_log += ai_message + \"\\n\"\n```\n\nIn this script, the loop continuously prompts the user to enter a message, sends the entire chat log (including the user's message) to the OpenAI API using the `openai.Completion.create()` method, and gets a response from GPT-3. The AI response is then printed to the console and added to the chat log.\n\nNote that this is a basic example and you should customize the script to fit your specific use case, such as adding input validation or error handling. Additionally, you might want to use a unique identifier (such as a user ID) to keep track of different chat sessions, so that you don't mix up messages from different users."}]}, {"facetValue": "provide guidance on integrating the Wolfram Alpha API with a GPT-3 chatbot to enhance its computational and information retrieval capabilities.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "learn how to integrate the Wolfram Alpha API with the GPT-3 chatbot to enhance its computational and factual answering capabilities."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "provide guidance on integrating the Wolfram Alpha API with a GPT-3 chatbot to enhance its computational and information retrieval capabilities."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "how do I install the Wolfram plugin in GPT4 Chatbot and how will the installation of the Wolfram plugin help me when using it "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As of now, there isn't a direct plugin available to integrate Wolfram Alpha API with GPT-4, given that GPT-4 itself has not been released.

Register and get the Wolfram Alpha API key: Sign up for an account on the Wolfram Alpha developer portal (https://developer.wolframalpha.com/). After registering, create a new App and obtain an App ID (API key).\n\n2. Install the Wolfram Alpha Python library: Use Python to integrate the Wolfram Alpha API. You can install the library via pip:\n```bash\npip install wolframalpha\n```\n\n3. Connect to the Wolfram Alpha API: Import the library and connect to the Wolfram Alpha API using your API key:\n```python\nimport wolframalpha\n\nAPI_KEY = 'your_app_id_here'\nclient = wolframalpha.Client(API_KEY)\n```\n\n4.

Integrate the Wolfram Alpha function with your GPT-3 chatbot. When using OpenAI's GPT-3, you may include a function call to `query_wolfram_alpha()` whenever you'd like to access Wolfram Alpha's computation capabilities.\n\nThe installation of the Wolfram Alpha plugin (API integration) will help you obtain quick answers and calculation results while using the chatbot.

This program, driven by GPT-4, chains together LLM \"thoughts\", to autonomously achieve whatever goal you set. As one of the first examples of GPT-4 running fully autonomously, Auto-GPT pushes the boundaries of what is possible with AI.\n\nDemo (30/03/2023):\n?? Help Fund Auto-GPT's Development ??\nIf you can spare a coffee, you can help to cover the API costs of developing Auto-GPT and help push the boundaries of fully autonomous AI! A full day of development can easily cost as much as $20 in API costs, which for a free project is quite limiting. Your support is greatly appreciated\n\nDevelopment of this free, open-source project is made possible by all the contributors and sponsors. If you'd like to sponsor this project and have your avatar or company logo appear below click here.\n\nIndividual Sponsors\nrobinicus  prompthero  crizzler  tob-le-rone  FSTatSBS  toverly1  ddtarazona  Nalhos  Kazamario  pingbotan  indoor47  AuroraHolding  kreativai  hunteraraujo  Explorergt92  judegomila   thepok   SpacingLily  merwanehamadi  m  zkonduit  maxxflyer  tekelsey  digisomni  nocodeclarity  tjarmain\n\nTable of Contents\nAuto-GPT: An Autonomous GPT-4 Experiment\nDemo (30/03/2023):\nTable of Contents\n??

Requirements\nPython 3.8 or later\nOpenAI API key\nPINECONE API key\nOptional:\n\nElevenLabs Key (If you want the AI to speak)\n?? Installation\nTo install Auto-GPT, follow these steps:\n\nMake sure you have all the requirements above, if not, install/get them.\nThe following commands should be executed in a CMD, Bash or Powershell window. To do this, go to a folder on your computer, click in the folder path at the top and type CMD, then press enter.\n\nClone the repository: For this step you need Git installed, but you can just download the zip file instead by clicking the button at the top of this page \u261d\ufe0f\ngit clone https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT.git\nNavigate to the project directory: (Type this into your CMD window, you're aiming to navigate the CMD window to the repository you just downloaded)\ncd 'Auto-GPT'\nInstall the required dependencies: (Again, type this into your CMD window)\npip install -r requirements.txt\nRename .env.template to .env and fill in your OPENAI_API_KEY. If you plan to use Speech Mode, fill in your ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY as well.\nObtain your OpenAI API key from: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.\nObtain your ElevenLabs API key from: https://elevenlabs.io. You can view your xi-api-key using the \"Profile\" tab on the website.\nIf you want to use GPT on an Azure instance, set USE_AZURE to True and then:\nRename azure.yaml.template to azure.yaml and provide the relevant azure_api_base, azure_api_version and all of the deployment ids for the relevant models in the azure_model_map section:\nfast_llm_model_deployment_id - your gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4 deployment id\nsmart_llm_model_deployment_id - your gpt-4 deployment id\nembedding_model_deployment_id - your text-embedding-ada-002 v2 deployment id\nPlease specify all of these values as double quoted strings\ndetails can be found here: https://pypi.org/project/openai/ in the Microsoft Azure Endpoints section and here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/tutorials/embeddings?tabs=command-line for the embedding model.\n?? Usage\nRun the main.py Python script in your terminal: (Type this into your CMD window)\npython scripts/main.py\nAfter each of AUTO-GPT's actions, type \"NEXT COMMAND\" to authorise them to continue.\nTo exit the program, type \"exit\" and press Enter.\nLogs\nYou will find activity and error logs in the folder ./output/logs\n\nTo output debug logs:\n\npython scripts/main.py --debug\n??\ufe0f Speech Mode\nUse this to use TTS for Auto-GPT\n\npython scripts/main.py --speak\n?? Google API Keys Configuration\nThis section is optional, use the official google api if you are having issues with error 429 when running a google search. To use the google_official_search command, you need to set up your Google API keys in your environment variables.\n\nGo to the Google Cloud Console.\nIf you don't already have an account, create one and log in.\nCreate a new project by clicking on the \"Select a Project\" dropdown at the top of the page and clicking \"New Project\". Give it a name and click \"Create\".\nGo to the APIs & Services Dashboard and click \"Enable APIs and Services\". Search for \"Custom Search API\" and click on it, then click \"Enable\".\nGo to the Credentials page and click \"Create Credentials\". Choose \"API Key\".\nCopy the API key and set it as an environment variable named GOOGLE_API_KEY on your machine. See setting up environment variables below.\nGo to the Custom Search Engine page and click \"Add\".\nSet up your search engine by following the prompts. You can choose to search the entire web or specific sites.\nOnce you've created your search engine, click on \"Control Panel\" and then \"Basics\". Copy the \"Search engine ID\" and set it as an environment variable named CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID on your machine. See setting up environment variables below.\nRemember that your free daily custom search quota allows only up to 100 searches. To increase this limit, you need to assign a billing account to the project to profit from up to 10K daily searches.\n\nSetting up environment variables\nFor Windows Users:\n\nsetx GOOGLE_API_KEY \"YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY\"\nsetx CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID \"YOUR_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID\"\n\nFor macOS and Linux users:\n\nexport GOOGLE_API_KEY=\"YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY\"\nexport CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=\"YOUR_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID\"\n\nRedis Setup\nInstall docker desktop.\n\nRun:\n\ndocker run -d --name redis-stack-server -p 6379:6379 redis/redis-stack-server:latest\nSee https://hub.docker.com/r/redis/redis-stack-server for setting a password and additional configuration.\n\nSet the following environment variables:\n\nMEMORY_BACKEND=redis\nREDIS_HOST=localhost\nREDIS_PORT=6379\nREDIS_PASSWORD=\nNote that this is not intended to be run facing the internet and is not secure, do not expose redis to the internet without a password or at all really.\n\nYou can optionally set\n\nWIPE_REDIS_ON_START=False\nTo persist memory stored in Redis.\n\nYou can specify the memory index for redis using the following:\n\nMEMORY_INDEX=whatever\n?? Pinecone API Key Setup\nPinecone enables the storage of vast amounts of vector-based memory, allowing for only relevant memories to be loaded for the agent at any given time.\n\nGo to pinecone and make an account if you don't already have one.\nChoose the Starter plan to avoid being charged.\nFind your API key and region under the default project in the left sidebar.\nSetting up environment variables\nSimply set them in the .env file.\n\nAlternatively, you can set them from the command line (advanced):\n\nFor Windows Users:\n\nsetx PINECONE_API_KEY \"YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY\"\nsetx PINECONE_ENV \"Your pinecone region\" # something like: us-east4-gcp\n\nFor macOS and Linux users:\n\nexport PINECONE_API_KEY=\"YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY\"\nexport PINECONE_ENV=\"Your pinecone region\" # something like: us-east4-gcp\n\nSetting Your Cache Type\nBy default Auto-GPT is going to use LocalCache instead of redis or Pinecone.\n\nTo switch to either, change the MEMORY_BACKEND env variable to the value that you want:\n\nlocal (default) uses a local JSON cache file pinecone uses the Pinecone.io account you configured in your ENV settings redis will use the redis cache that you configured\n\nView Memory Usage\nView memory usage by using the --debug flag :)\n?? Continuous Mode \u26a0\ufe0f\nRun the AI without user authorisation, 100% automated. Continuous mode is not recommended. It is potentially dangerous and may cause your AI to run forever or carry out actions you would not usually authorise. Use at your own risk.\n\nRun the main.py Python script in your terminal:\npython scripts/main.py --continuous\n\nTo exit the program, press Ctrl + C\nGPT3.5 ONLY Mode\nIf you don't have access to the GPT4 api, this mode will allow you to use Auto-GPT!\n\npython scripts/main.py --gpt3only\nIt is recommended to use a virtual machine for tasks that require high security measures to prevent any potential harm to the main computer's system and data.\n\n?? Image Generation\nBy default, Auto-GPT uses DALL-e for image generation. To use Stable Diffusion, a HuggingFace API Token is required.\n\nOnce you have a token, set these variables in your .env:\n\nIMAGE_PROVIDER=sd\nHUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=\"YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN\"\n\u26a0\ufe0f Limitations\nThis experiment aims to showcase the potential of GPT-4 but comes with some limitations:\n\nNot a polished application or product, just an experiment\nMay not perform well in complex, real-world business scenarios. In fact, if it actually does, please share your results!\nQuite expensive to run, so set and monitor your API key limits with OpenAI!\n??

Credit: Getty Images\n > Tech\nIf GPT-4 put hustle culture on steroids, then Auto-GPT is like those steroids taking steroids.\n\nAuto-GPT(Opens in a new tab) is the latest creation spawned from OpenAI's API that has hustle bros and get-rich-quick schemers in a tizzy. ChatGPT is already commonplace for hustle bros, who worship anything that will optimize efficiency \u2014 with the ultimate goal of making as much money as possible with the least amount of effort. And now Auto-GPT is making their prompt-engineered-heads explode with its capabilities.\n\nTo be clear, Auto-GPT is technically very impressive, and for all we know, the intentions of its creators were pure. But the way opportunists have latched onto it is what makes people leery of AI in the first place. If you're wondering why the crypto bro who became a ChatGPT bro is now tweeting about Auto-GPT, here's why.\n\nSEE ALSO: HustleGPT is a hilarious and scary AI experiment in capitalism \nWhat is Auto-GPT\nAuto-GPT is an open-source application, created by developer Toran Bruce Richards. It uses OpenAI's large language model, GPT-4, to automate the execution of multi-step projects that would have required back-and-forth prompting if you worked directly with GPT-4. In other words, it \"chains together LLM 'thoughts', to autonomously achieve whatever goal you set,\" according to the GitHub repo page. Auto-GPT was released last week, so it's early days, but Twitter is already giddy over its use cases for some of the time-honored hustle bro strategies, including analyzing stocks(Opens in a new tab), automating product reviews(Opens in a new tab), and creating a podcast(Opens in a new tab).\n\nTweet may have been deleted(opens in a new tab)(Opens in a new tab)\nTweet may have been deleted(opens in a new tab)(Opens in a new tab)\nTweet may have been deleted(opens in a new tab)(Opens in a new tab)\nHow does Auto-GPT work?\nAuto-GPT is publicly available on GitHub. But you need some kind of programming experience to know how use it, since it runs on Python and requires OpenAI and Pinecone API keys. However, theres already at least one similar app, AgentGPT,(Opens in a new tab) that doesn't require coding knowledge.\n\nFor now, users enter prompts directly in terminal. You're asked to describe the name, role, and objectives of your AI and specify up to five goals to achieve that objective.\n\nIn the demo video, \"Entrepreneur-GPT\" is given the role to \"autonomously develop and run businesses with the sole goal of increasing your net worth.\" The goals are to \"increase net worth,\" \"grow Twitter account,\" and \"develop and manage multiple businesses autonomously.\" Like a bloodhound with a scent, the demo of Auto-GPT is unleashed and immediately gets to work. No need to give it the next prompt. Auto-GPT will be ruthlessly and single-mindedly working to make its master the next magnate of affiliate-linked garbage or some other money-making scheme.\n\nWhy are hustle bros excited about Auto-GPT\nThe goal of Auto-GPT is to \"make GPT-4 fully autonomous.\" For people looking to optimize their productivity (a hustle bro tenet), that's a dream come true. ChatGPT was already taking hustle culture to the next level. After it launched, social media was flooded with ChatGPT hustlers flaunting ways \u2014 legitimate or not \u2014 of using the LLM to automate jobs like copywriting, setting up affiliate marketing content, and even making tutorials on Udemy, as The Verge reported(Opens in a new tab).\n\nBut such schemes still required human input to nudge ChatGPT to the next step. With Auto-GPT, you can simply describe what you want your AI to do, outline up to five goals, then kick up your feet and pat yourself on the back for outsmarting the system.\n\nRelated Stories\nUsers who spot bugs in ChatGPT can now make up to $20,000\nChatGPT banned in Italy\nNonprofit files FTC complaint against OpenAI's GPT-4\nOpenAI's GPT-4 aced all of its exams \u2013 except for these\nTweet may have been deleted(opens in a new tab)(Opens in a new tab)\nTweet may have been deleted(opens in a new tab)(Opens in a new tab)\nTweet may have been deleted(opens in a new tab)(Opens in a new tab)\nDoes Auto-GPT live up to the hype?\nLet's put aside the fact that affiliate marketing or freelance copywriting won't make you an overnight billionaire, and focus on the fact that it's a brand new technology that's explicitly described as \"experimental.\" Like GPT-4, anything that's built with it is prone to inaccuracies and hallucinations. When using ChatGPT, you can check it for errors or recalibrate your conversation if the model starts to go off the rails. But with Auto-GPT, you might give it a project, then go to bed, leaving the model unattended for hours (which is the point). By the time you wake up, who knows what could've happened \u2014 especially if you told GPT-4 something like \"make as much money as possible.\"\n\nTweet may have been deleted(opens in a new tab)(Opens in a new tab)\nIt's a classic jumping on the bandwagon situation. Except this bandwagon is perched on top of another bandwagon (ChatGPT) which is a very precarious position indeed. To be fair, claims that Auto-GPT is the \"next big thing\" are somewhat substantiated. OpenAI founding member Andrej Karpathy recently tweeted(Opens in a new tab) his opinion that tools like Auto-GPT would be \"the next frontier of prompt engineering.\" And the automation of ChatGPT tasks undoubtedly has massive potential.\n\nBut for now, we're just annoyed that hustle bros have a shiny new toy at their disposal.\n\nMore in Artificial Intelligence, ChatGPT\n\nMashable Image\nCecily Mauran\nCecily is a tech reporter at Mashable who covers AI, Apple, and emerging tech trends.

My first request is \"I want to write an opinion GPT-5 .\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Title: Why the Development of GPT-5 Demands Critical Consideration and Discussion\n\nAs we stand on the precipice of artificial intelligence truly transforming the way we live, work and communicate, it is essential for society to acknowledge and engage in discourse surrounding the ethical implications and potential impact of these advancements. One such development that demands our collective scrutiny is OpenAI's GPT-3 language model, and the expected emergence of its successor GPT-5. In this opinion piece, I delve into the importance of having a critical conversation and formulating thoughtful strategies to address the challenges and potential consequences posed by powerful AI like GPT-5.\n\nFirstly, let us consider the incredible capabilities of GPT-3, which has already demonstrated impressive language understanding, writing code, creating website designs, and even generating human-like responses in virtual conversations. While the technology has not yet reached perfection, GPT-5 will undoubtedly strive to improve upon its predecessor's shortcomings, like the lack of contextual awareness and potential for malicious use.\n\nThe critical question we must ask ourselves is how to maintain control and responsibility for AI systems as they become increasingly sophisticated and autonomous. Much of this responsibility falls on the shoulders of developers and regulators to collectively implement measures such as better monitoring, content filtering, and minimizing output bias. This is easier said than done, but transparency in AI governance and collaboration across the industry should be prioritized.\n\nMoreover, it is vital to cultivate a public understanding of AI developments like GPT-5. By highlighting its capabilities, potential for misuse, and the ethical boundaries that must be maintained, society can engage in informed discussions and contribute to responsible AI development. OpenAI\u2019s Charter, which emphasizes beneficial use and broad distribution, serves as a good starting point yet should continue to evolve as the conversation progresses.\n\nThe issue of job displacement should also not be overlooked. GPT-5's potential to create content at scale and remarkable accuracy might lead certain professional roles to become obsolete. As technology progresses, it is incumbent upon governments, businesses, and educators to prepare the workforce for future challenges through upskilling and reskilling, STEM education, and promoting the intertwined growth of both human expertise and AI capabilities.\n\nFurthermore, as AI-generated content becomes even more difficult to distinguish from human-generated work, it becomes essential to develop tools and strategies to identify such content. This is not only to maintain intellectual rights and property but also to ensure that users can trust and verify the sources of information they encounter. Striking a balance between AI advancement and content identification will be crucial in maintaining a cohesive digital space.\n\nLastly, the potential for misinformation and disinformation facilitated by advanced AI models should not be ignored. The ability of GPT-5 to generate accurate and coherent content can be a double-edged sword, capable of perpetuating misleading information or propaganda. It is critical that responsible parties, be it governments or companies, take decisive action to prevent the misuse of AI in spreading falsehoods, without inhibiting free speech or access to legitimate, helpful AI tools.\n\nIn conclusion, while the development of GPT-5 promises significant advancements in AI-powered language models and a myriad of potential applications, it also thrusts us into a new era of ethical and societal challenges. We must embrace these challenges, engage in meaningful discussion and collaboration, and address the complex problems that powerful AI systems like GPT-5 introduce. By adopting this proactive mindset, we can ensure that technology benefits mankind without crossing the thresholds of ethical use, responsibility, and public trust."}]}, {"facetValue": "analyze and describe an open-source project, Auto-GPT, which provides a GUI for interacting with the GPT-3 API.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "obtain an analysis of the Auto-GPT project, which provides a GUI for interacting with the GPT-3 API."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "analyze and describe an open-source project, Auto-GPT, which provides a GUI for interacting with the GPT-3 API."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "analiza en profundidad este desarrollo https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Auto-GPT es un proyecto de c\u00f3digo abierto alojado en GitHub que intenta brindar una GUI (interfaz gr\u00e1fica de usuario) amigable y din\u00e1mica a la API de OpenAI, en particular para trabajar con el modelo GPT-3. Proporciona una manera eficiente y c\u00f3moda de interactuar con los modelos de GPT-3 mientras automatiza ciertas interacciones. A continuaci\u00f3n se presenta un an\u00e1lisis detallado del proyecto.\n\n1. Estructura del proyecto:\n\nEl repositorio consta de tres secciones principales:\n  - El directorio \"docs\" que contiene la gu\u00eda de implementaci\u00f3n y configuraci\u00f3n de Auto-GPT. \n  - Los archivos de configuraci\u00f3n y requisitos de Python necesarios para instalar y ejecutar correctamente el proyecto en el entorno local.\n  - El archivo \"translate.py\" que es el principal punto de entrada de la aplicaci\u00f3n y contiene la l\u00f3gica de ejecuci\u00f3n de la aplicaci\u00f3n.\n\n2. Instalaci\u00f3n y configuraci\u00f3n:\n\nEl proyecto indica claramente c\u00f3mo llevar a cabo la instalaci\u00f3n y configuraci\u00f3n en las instrucciones presentes en el archivo \"README.md\" y el directorio \"docs\". Los requisitos se enumeran en el archivo \"requirements.txt\" y ser\u00e1 instalado utilizando el comando `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\n\n3. Funcionamiento:\n\nAuto-GPT utiliza Python y Streamlit, una biblioteca de Python, para implementar una interfaz web interactiva f\u00e1cilmente. El flujo de trabajo esencial en Auto-GPT es establecer la comunicaci\u00f3n con la API de OpenAI y manejar las interacciones con GPT-3 de una manera m\u00e1s intuitiva.\n\nLuego de ejecutar la aplicaci\u00f3n, mediante el comando `streamlit run x.py` donde x.py es uno de los archivos disponibles en el repositorio, el usuario ver\u00e1 una GUI a trav\u00e9s de su navegador donde podr\u00e1 especificar par\u00e1metros como \"Texto de entrada\", \"Temperatura\", \"Token m\u00e1ximo\" y otros ajustes relacionados con su consulta a GPT-3. Luego de proporcionar estos detalles el usuario puede generar la respuesta presionando el bot\u00f3n 'Enviar' y obtendr\u00e1 la respuesta correspondiente de GPT-3.\n\n4. Personalizaci\u00f3n:\n\nEl proyecto depende en gran medida de Streamlit para crear la GUI. Streamlit es una biblioteca ligera y altamente adaptable que utiliza funciones puras de Python. Esto significa que este proyecto puede ser f\u00e1cilmente personalizado en la medida en que lo permite Streamlit.\n\nPara cambiar la apariencia o la funcionalidad de la aplicaci\u00f3n, los usuarios pueden explorar la documentaci\u00f3n oficial de Streamlit: [Streamlit Docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/) y modificar el c\u00f3digo fuente en consecuencia.\n\n5. Beneficios y limitaciones:\n \nBeneficios:\n   - Interacci\u00f3n simple y visual con la API de OpenAI.\n   - Facilita la experimentaci\u00f3n y exploraci\u00f3n de caracter\u00edsticas de GPT-3.\n   - Proyecto modificado para proporcionar una demostraci\u00f3n de la traducci\u00f3n entre idiomas.\n   - Facilita ajustes de f\u00e1cil comprensi\u00f3n para los hiperpar\u00e1metros del modelo GPT-3.\n\nLimitaciones:\n   - La interfaz proporcionada est\u00e1 limitada a las capacidades de Streamlit.\n   - El n\u00famero de opciones de configuraci\u00f3n es limitado en comparaci\u00f3n con las interacciones directas con la API de OpenAI.\n   - Es necesario utilizar una clave API de OpenAI, lo cual puede incurrir en costos, dependiendo del acceso y uso del usuario de GPT-3.\n\nEn resumen, Auto-GPT es un proyecto interesante que facilita a los usuarios menos t\u00e9cnicos interactuar y aprovechar el poder de los modelos GPT-3 de OpenAI utilizando una GUI basada en Streamlit. Ofrece un punto de partida s\u00f3lido para aquellos interesados en experimentar con GPT-3 y aprender a utilizar API de OpenAI mientras proporciona una experiencia m\u00e1s completa al usuario gracias a su personalizaci\u00f3n y ajustes de hiperpar\u00e1metros.
