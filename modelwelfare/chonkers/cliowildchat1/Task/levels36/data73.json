Infrared spectroscopy is a powerful analytical technique that capitalizes on the absorption of infrared radiation by molecules at specific wavelengths, which are characteristic of their chemical structure and molecular vibrations.\n\nIn this experiment, we aim to use IR spectroscopy to identify and quantify the presence of Acetone and Hexane by examining their respective absorption bands in two key regions of the IR spectrum: the functional group region (4000 to 1500 cm-1) and the fingerprint region (1500 to 500 cm-1). These regions contain distinct peaks that correspond to the molecular vibrations of specific functional groups within the molecules, allowing for their identification and analysis.\n\nTo analyze the mixed Acetone/Hexane sample, the following steps will be undertaken:\n\n1. Sample Collection and Preparation: Prior to the analysis, air samples containing the unknown concentration of Acetone and Hexane are collected and prepared for analysis to ensure a representative and stable sample.\n\n2. IR Spectrophotometer Calibration: The IR spectrophotometer is calibrated using standard reference materials and baseline corrected to ensure accurate measurements and eliminate any potential instrument variations or errors.\n\n3. Spectral Acquisition: The mixed Acetone/Hexane sample is introduced into the IR spectrophotometer, and the infrared radiation is passed through the sample. The absorption of infrared radiation by Acetone and Hexane results in the generation of an IR spectrum exhibiting characteristic peaks in the functional group and fingerprint regions.\n\n4. Peak Identification and Quantification: The acquired IR spectrum is analyzed to identify the characteristic peaks of Acetone and Hexane based on their known absorption bands in the functional group and fingerprint regions. These peaks may include C=O stretching in Acetone (approximately 1710 cm-1) and CH stretching in Hexane (approximately 2900 - 2800 cm-1), among others.\n\n5. Concentration Determination: Once the characteristic peaks are identified, the peak intensities are measured and correlated to the concentration of each component through the use of Beer-Lambert Law, which states the absorbance of a sample is directly proportional to its concentration. By comparing the acquired data to standard reference data or calibration curves, the concentration of Acetone and Hexane in the sample can be accurately determined.\n\nBy undertaking this experimental process, analysts gain hands-on experience with infrared spectrophotometry, quantitative gas sampling, and analysis techniques.

Each of these techniques has distinct advantages and limitations for organ segmentation.\n\nMicro CT is a commonly used imaging technique that provides high spatial resolution and can be used to visualize the internal structures of small organs in 3D. However, micro CT requires high doses of radiation and is not suitable for sensitive or living tissues. Light sheet microscopy is another technique that can be used for organ segmentation, providing high-speed, high-resolution imaging of living tissue. Light sheet microscopy can capture optical sections without requiring tissue sectioning, which can prevent artifacts in organ segmentation. However, light sheet microscopy can suffer from limitations in penetration depth and may not penetrate through thick organs or tissues.\n\nMM-OCT provides unique advantages for organ segmentation due to its ability to extract detailed information about the polarization properties of the imaged tissue. This allows for the differentiation of different cellular and tissue structures based on their birefringence and polarization properties. MM-OCT can also perform non-destructive 3D imaging of living biological tissue with a high spatial resolution of a few microns.

Unlike conventional OCT, MM-OCT can additionally perform polarimetric analyses of the imaged tissue, enabling the characterization of biological tissues at the micron scale based on their scattering and polarization properties. These properties can be used to distinguish different cellular structures within a tissue, which can be valuable in organ segmentation.\n\nA study published in 2015 titled \"Mueller matrix optical coherence tomography for imaging the microstructure of zebrafish embryos\" demonstrated the superior organ segmentation capability of MM-OCT over conventional OCT for zebrafish embryo imaging. In this study, the authors compared the performance of conventional OCT and MM-OCT in imaging the microstructure of zebrafish embryos. They found that MM-OCT provided higher contrast and better definition of internal organ structure than conventional OCT.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, MM-OCT can capture information about birefringent structures (i.e., anisotropic structures that alter the polarization of light) within the tissue, which enables enhanced visualization of different internal structures with varying birefringent properties. The study specifically highlighted the capability of MM-OCT to identify many types of internal structures in zebrafish embryos, such as the spinal cord, yolk sac, and circulatory system, with high contrast and accuracy, demonstrating its superiority over conventional OCT in organ segmentation.\n\nOverall, the advantages of MM-OCT for organ segmentation include its ability to provide high-resolution 3D images of biological tissue with minimal tissue damage, while also providing important additional polarization information for improved contrast and differentiation of internal structures. While conventional OCT is still a valuable imaging technique, MM-OCT has the potential to provide better segmentation and more detailed analyses of biological tissue thanks to its unique polarimetric capabilities.\n\nReference:\n\nXie, T., Wang, Y., Li, Y., & Li, X.

In previous studies, a variety of OCT setups have been used to image zebrafish embryos, including time-domain OCT (TD-OCT), swept-source OCT (SS-OCT), and spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT). However, MM-OCT provides key advantages over these techniques due to its polarization-sensitive detection of tissue microstructure.\n\nOne of the key benefits of MM-OCT in imaging zebrafish embryos is its ability to provide detailed information about the polarization properties of the tissue. This enables better visualization of different cellular structures based on their anisotropic properties, such as the spinal cord, yolk sac, and circulatory system. Furthermore, MM-OCT can capture important contrast signals from scattering and birefringent structures that are difficult to observe with conventional OCT. In addition, MM-OCT can non-invasively image living embryos in three dimensions with high resolution, enabling longitudinal studies without significantly affecting the development or survival of the embryos.\n\nSeveral studies have compared MM-OCT to conventional OCT techniques in zebrafish embryo imaging, with results consistently favoring MM-OCT due to its superior capability to reveal tissue microstructure with more clarity and contrast. In a study by Xie et al. (2015), MM-OCT was found to provide better visualization of the spinal cord and circulatory system than TD-OCT, in addition to enhanced overall contrast. Similarly, a study by Wang et al. (2016) demonstrated improved visualization of the blood vessel network in zebrafish embryos using MM-OCT compared to SS-OCT. A more recent study by Cao et al. (2019) also showed that MM-OCT provides better differentiation of different embryonic tissues with enhanced contrast compared to SD-OCT.\n\nIn summary, while conventional OCT techniques have been used successfully to image zebrafish embryos, MM-OCT provides distinct benefits over these techniques, offering superior visualization of tissue microstructure and contrast while non-invasively imaging living embryos in three dimensions.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Zebrafish embryos also have small sizes, which require high resolution imaging approaches such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) or Mueller matrix OCT (MM-OCT). Here are some potential challenges related to organ segmentation in zebrafish organ analysis:\n\n1. Tissue transparency: Zebrafish embryos are relatively transparent, which can make it challenging to differentiate different organs within the tissue. This can make it difficult to identify boundaries between organs and may require additional imaging modalities, such as fluorescence imaging or electron microscopy, to aid in the segmentation process.\n\n2. Organ size: The small size of zebrafish embryos can make it difficult to accurately segment internal organs, particularly in cases where organs are located in close proximity to each other. This requires careful imaging and analysis to separate and segment the individual organs with minimal overlap or misclassification.\n\n3. Organ development: Zebrafish embryos undergo rapid, complex developmental changes, which can make accurate segmentation of organs challenging. The morphology and location of the organs can change quickly over time, so it is necessary to use imaging techniques with high temporal resolution to capture these changes.\n\n4. Image quality: High-quality imaging is critical for accurate organ segmentation. As imaging modalities such as MM-OCT, are sensitive to optical scattering and birefringence, issues related to refractive errors, surface roughness of the lenses or tissue interfaces or staining methods may affect image quality and subsequently, organ segmentation.\n\n5. Reproducibility: In zebrafish organ analysis, the segmentation of organs should be reproducible, accurate, and unbiased. Achieving this level of objectivity in organ segmentation may require using automated image processing and machine learning algorithms.\n\nAddressing these potential challenges requires careful planning and execution while performing imaging, processing and analysis of zebrafish embryos using MM-OCT.\n\nReferences: \n\n1.

Because people included in the study were so familiar with the Western alphabet, their brains expected to see the letters in their actual orientation.\n\nWhen letters appeared mirrored (\u0186 instead of C), people were more likely to remember the pseudo-letter as a real letter, even after only milliseconds had passed.\n\n\"It seems that short-term memory is not always an accurate representation of what was just perceived,\" the researchers write. \"Instead, memory is shaped by what we expected to see, right from the formation of the first memory trace.\"\n\n\nStudy participants were shown six or eight letters on a screen. They were then shown a 'memory display' with a box marking out the location of the target letter. Then there was an interference condition containing random letters, which was designed to scramble the original memory. At the end, they were asked to recall which letter was in the target region in the first slide and whether it was a pseudo-letter. (Otten et al., PLOS One, 2023)\nThe researchers showed these were false memories rather than wrong guesses by asking the participants how confident they were in their memories on a score of one to four.\n\n\"Participants consistently report, with high confidence, that they have seen the real counterpart of a pseudo-letter target,\" the researchers write.\n\nPeople were more likely to switch a pseudo-letter for a real letter than the other way around, suggesting that memory illusions are mediated by world knowledge of how things usually look.\n\nThe researchers differentiated these false memories from errors in initial perception by taking measurements at two time points. The only opportunity was during the 0.25 seconds in which the letters were flashed.\n\nIf perception errors were driving the mistakes, the error rate would be the same 500 milliseconds and 3 seconds later. When the error rate increased over time, this suggested that false memories were forming.\n\n\nPeople were more likely to have false memories of pseudo-letter targets than real letter targets, and the error rate increased with time and memory interference. (Otten et al., PLOS One, 2023)\nWe know from experiments led by psychologist Elizabeth Loftus and others that false long-term memories can be easily generated.\n\nFor instance, adults can be persuaded to recall a vivid but fake memory of getting lost in a shopping center and crying as a child. In another study, people generated false, rich memories of committing crimes such as theft or assault.\n\nFake long-term memories are thought to be driven by the 'fuzzy trace theory', which states that memory comes from two parts: a verbatim part, which is what happened in real life, and a gist part, where the person interprets the meaning of the event based on semantic analysis.\n\nA previous study showed that when people were given a picture of a face and a profession, they were more likely to link criminal labels such as 'drug dealer' to faces with Black features, indicating that internal biases were shaping memories.\n\nIn another study, people were given a list of three or four interrelated words (such as nap, doze, bed, and awake). When given a second list, participants were more likely to remember semantically related words not on the original list, such as sleep.\n\nFuzzy trace theory may also be driving short-term memory illusions but \"cannot entirely explain the current findings\", the researchers write.\n\nThese experiments suggest that our verbatim memory input is immediately integrated with previous experiences and expectations.\n\nThis paper was published in PLOS One.\n\n\u0421\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434 \u0438

Contrary to popular belief that daydreaming is just a sign of laziness and lack of focus, Stromberg presents multiple research findings that suggest that daydreaming is a crucial aspect of our mental functioning. This paper will explore the findings that support this idea, as well as my own daydreaming experiences after analyzing the presented research.\n\nStromberg's findings indicate that daydreaming is essential for our cognitive and emotional development. According to researchers from the University of California, Santa Barbara, daydreaming is a form of \"mental wandering,\" which significantly increases one's creativity, problem-solving skills, and overall intelligence. (Stromberg) Furthermore, they claim that daydreaming can benefit the brain as it keeps it active, thus preventing cognitive decline in the long run. In addition, it fosters the ability to develop mental shortcuts for complex tasks.\n\nAnother study cited by Stromberg reveals that daydreaming plays an essential role in our emotional well-being. It is explained that daydreaming allows us to review and replay our past experiences through a neural process called \"mind wandering.\" This process often takes the form of autobiographical daydreams that involve the simulation of past experiences and provide an opportunity for emotional self-regulation, which is crucial for mental health. (Stromberg)\n\nThe Atlantic article, \"Teach Kids to Daydream\" by Jessica Lahey, echoes this sentiment, stating that daydreaming is necessary for creative thinking, problem-solving, empathy, and social skills, among other essential cognitive abilities. Recognizing the myriad benefits of daydreaming, Lahey encourages educators to integrate daydreaming exercises into the school curriculum for optimal cognitive and emotional development in students.\n\nIn addition to understanding the benefits of daydreaming on both cognitive and emotional levels, these sources provided me with the necessary tools to track my daydreaming activities. Over one day, I noticed that I daydreamed more frequently during time gaps between tasks, such as during my morning commute, while waiting for a friend, or during the night while trying to fall asleep. I also found that I was more likely to daydream when I was in a relaxed, quiet environment or when listening to music.\n\nInterestingly, I discovered that my daydreams mostly revolved around scenarios that involved me interacting with others or achieving personal goals. They often centered on hypothetical situations, such as how I would react in particular circumstances, or they involved mental rehearsals of upcoming events, like planning a conversation with a coworker or visualizing an exam's outcome. This observation helped me realize that my daydreams serve as a safe space for me to rehearse, formulate, and process potential real-life experiences, an insight in line with the studies cited by Stromberg.\n\nAfter tracking my daydreams for a day, I found that my previous perception of daydreaming as an unproductive and idle behavior has shifted. The research presented in Smithsonian Magazine and The Atlantic has shown that daydreaming is essential for cognitive functioning, creativity, problem-solving, and emotional well-being. Furthermore, the realization that my daydreams assist me in mentally preparing and rehearsing possible scenarios has increased my appreciation for and understanding of the importance of daydreaming.\n\nIn conclusion, the process of researching daydreaming as well as tracking my daydreams has significantly changed my perception of this ostensibly passive and unproductive behavior. The evidence supporting the cognitive and emotional benefits of daydreaming presents a solid argument for its necessity in our lives, warranting further exploration into how daydreaming can be integrated into educational and professional settings to optimize overall mental functioning.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nLahey, Jessica. \"Teach Kids to Daydream.\" The Atlantic, October 31, 2013. https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/10/teach-kids-to-daydream/280615/\n\nStromberg, Joseph. \"The Benefits of Daydreaming.\" Smithsonian Magazine, March 19, 2013. https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-benefits-of-daydreaming-170189213/"}]}, {"facetValue": "fit a model to analyze response times and choices in a decision-making experiment.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "fit a model for a five-choice decision-making process using the brms package in R."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "fit a model to analyze response times and choices in a decision-making experiment."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "2"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "The following code returns: Error: Decisions should be 'lower' or 'upper' when supplied as characters or factors.\n\n\n\n# Load required packages\nlibrary(brms)\noptions(mc.cores = 4)\n\n# Load or create your data\n# The data should have columns: \n# - response_time: The time taken for each decision\n# - choice: The actual choice made by a participant (e.g., 1, 2, or 3 for a 3-alternative forced-choice decision)\n# - condition: The experimental condition (if applicable)\n# data <- \u2026\n\n# Fit the diffusion model\nfit <- brm(\n  formula = response_time | dec(rate) ~ 1 + level,\n  family = wiener(),\n  data = data,\n  prior = c(\n    # Priors for the model parameters\n    prior(normal(0, 1), class = \"Intercept\"),\n    prior(normal(0, 1), class = \"b\")#,\n    # prior(uniform(0, 1), class = \"phi\"),\n    # prior(uniform(0, 1), class = \"theta\")\n  ),\n  chains = 2,\n  iter = 2000,\n  warmup = 1000,\n  control = list(max_treedepth = 15)\n)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There seems to be a problem with the parameter 'decisions' in the formula argument.

People partaking naturally rewarding job tend to foster sense of competence, satisfaction, and purpose, as well as self-determination (Manz, 1986). Natural reward is particularly important when handling unpleasant missions in daily life, since we may easily lose motivation and determination. We cannot ignore obstacles, but we can adjust our angles in facing them. Hence, we could apply the above strategies by identifying and magnifying the joy and benefits we can obtain from the task, and attempting to manage the difficulties light-heartedly. Rewards have close relationship with motivation, and those intrinsic could link to positive effects of behavioural-focused strategies, such as handling work more efficiently and behave more confident and energetic in workplace.

In the 10-second grip task, swearers boosted their strength by the equivalent of 2.1kg, researchers found.\n\"In the short period of time we looked at there are benefits from swearing,\" said Richard Stephens, a psychologist at Keele University, who presented the results at the British Psychological Society meeting in Brighton.\nStephens enrolled 29 people aged about 21 for the cycling test, and 52 people with a typical age of 19 for the hand-grip test. All were asked to choose a swearword to repeat in the studies, based on a term they might utter if they banged their head. For the neutral word, the volunteers were asked to pick a word they might use to describe a table, such as \"wooden\" or \"brown\".\n\"We asked them to repeat the word throughout each test,\" Stephens said. \"They don\u2019t scream and shout it.

One important aspect of understanding behavior is the field of reinforcement schedules, in which various contingencies and patterns of reinforcement are used to alter, maintain, or extinguish certain behaviors. Originating from the seminal work of B.F. Skinner and the principles of operant conditioning, reinforcement schedules revolve around the idea that the consequences of a given behavior can either increase or decrease the likelihood of that behavior occurring in the future (Skinner, 1953). This essay aims to rigorously define four primary reinforcement schedules, fixed-ratio schedule, variable-ratio schedule, fixed-interval schedule, and variable-interval schedule, providing examples and discussing their application in the realms of psychology and beyond. \n\nFixed-ratio schedule\n\nThe fixed-ratio schedule (FR) is a schedule of reinforcement in which the subject must respond with a specified number of correct responses or perform a specific action in order to receive a reinforcer (Ferster & Skinner, 1957). In other words, the number of responses required for reinforcement is constant and predetermined in the FR schedule. For instance, consider a factory worker who is paid a certain amount for every ten products they assemble. In this case, after assembling the tenth product, the worker receives their payment. The rate of reinforcement is contingent on the worker's efforts, as they need to complete ten products before receiving their reward. This type of reinforcement schedule promotes a steady response rate, followed by a brief pause after receiving reinforcement (Catania, 2012).\n\nExample: Sales professionals often work on a commission-based payment structure, which entails earning a fixed percentage for every completed sale. In this scenario, the payment is contingent upon their performance, forming a fixed-ratio reinforcement schedule.\n\nVariable-ratio schedule\n\nVariable-ratio schedule (VR) is a reinforcement schedule in which reinforcement is delivered after an unpredictable number of responses (Ferster & Skinner, 1957). Essentially, the average number of responses required to receive reinforcement varies in VR schedules, but the overall probability of reinforcement remains constant. This type of reinforcement schedule typically produces a high and consistent rate of responding, as the subject learns that the more responses they make, the more likely they are to receive reinforcement (Sulzer-Azaroff & Mayer, 1991).\n\nExample: Gambling in casinos, such as playing slot machines, is a classic example of variable-ratio reinforcement schedule. The player does not know exactly how many times they need to play in order to win, but they learn that the more they play, the higher the likelihood of eventually receiving a reward.\n\nFixed-interval schedule\n\nThe fixed-interval schedule (FI) refers to a reinforcement schedule in which a reinforcer is delivered for the first response that occurs after a fixed, predetermined amount of time has elapsed (Ferster & Skinner, 1957). In other words, only the passage of time, not the number of responses, influences reinforcement delivery in the FI schedule. This reinforcement schedule generally produces a low rate of responding during the early stages of the interval, followed by a rapid increase in response rate as the interval end approaches (Herrnstein, 1961).\n\nExample: A university professor who gives students quizzes every Friday is implementing a fixed-interval schedule of reinforcement. Regardless of the number of times the students study, their performance receives reinforcement only at the predetermined interval of one week.\n\nVariable-interval schedule\n\nVariable-interval schedule (VI) is a reinforcement schedule in which reinforcement is delivered for the first response that occurs after a varying and unpredictable amount of time has elapsed (Ferster & Skinner, 1957). This schedule produces a moderate and consistent rate of responding, as the subject learns that responding at any time may result in reinforcement (Gibbon et al., 1984).\n\nExample: Checking social media for new messages or notifications is an instance of variable-interval reinforcement schedule. The user does not know exactly when they will receive a notification, but they continue to engage with the platform regularly as they hope to receive something interesting or rewarding.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, reinforcement schedules play a significant role in understanding and influencing behavior. This essay defined fixed-ratio, variable-ratio, fixed-interval, and variable-interval schedules, each with their distinct characteristics and effects on response patterns. Both the fields of psychology and applied behavior analysis continue to utilize and investigate these reinforcement schedules, making them an essential concept in understanding behavior and behavioral modification. By recognizing and manipulating these reinforcement schedules, researchers and practitioners can better develop evidence-based interventions for behavior change and optimization.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nCatania, A.

To understand Rayleigh scattering, we need to consider the interaction of sunlight with the Earth's atmosphere, which is filled with various gas molecules, dust particles, and water droplets. \n\nSunlight, or visible light, is composed of a range of wavelengths, with each color corresponding to a specific wavelength. The shorter wavelengths represent the blue end of the spectrum, while the longer wavelengths represent the red end of the spectrum. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it encounters the molecules and particles present within the air. These molecules and particles are of varying sizes, but many of them are smaller than the wavelengths of visible light.\n\nAs sunlight interacts with these atmospheric constituents, it is scattered in different directions. Rayleigh scattering is strongly dependent on the wavelength of light, with shorter wavelengths being scattered more effectively than longer wavelengths. Mathematically, the intensity of scattered light (I) is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength (\u03bb), as described by the equation: I \u221d 1/\u03bb^4. This means that blue light, which has a shorter wavelength, is scattered nearly 10 times more than red light with a longer wavelength.\n\nDue to this preferential scattering of shorter wavelengths, the blue light from the sun is scattered far more effectively in different directions as it passes through the atmosphere. As a result, when we look at the sky during daylight, we see it as blue because our eyes perceive the light that has been scattered in all directions, with blue light being the dominant color due to its stronger scattering. \n\nIt is important to note that the blue color of the sky is also influenced by human perception. Our eyes have photoreceptor cells called cones, which are sensitive to different wavelengths of light. The cones that are sensitive to blue light, called S-cones, play a crucial role in perceiving the sky as blue.\n\nLastly, during sunrise and sunset, the sky can appear red, orange, or pink, instead of blue. This is because the sunlight passes through a greater amount of the Earth's atmosphere at these times, scattering the blue light away and allowing the longer wavelengths, like red and orange, to dominate the sky's appearance. This phenomenon is known as atmospheric scattering or the Tyndall effect."}, {"role": "user", "content": "This short video outlines \"The Ben Franklin Effect\" and cognitive dissonance.

Testable hypothesis: High levels of cognitive dissonance lead to an increase in pro-social behavior among individuals.\n\n2. Independent variable: Level of cognitive dissonance; Dependent variable: Occurrence of pro-social behavior.\n\n3. Levels of the independent variable: Low cognitive dissonance, moderate cognitive dissonance, and high cognitive dissonance.\n\n4. The proposed experiment can test for causal relationships. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three conditions of cognitive dissonance (low, moderate, or high). To induce cognitive dissonance, participants will be asked to complete a task that contradicts their personal beliefs or values, with the intensity of contradiction varying for each level of cognitive dissonance. After completing the task, participants will be given an opportunity to engage in pro-social behavior by either helping or not helping another participant, a confederate, who is visibly struggling with a problem. The number of participants who choose to help in each cognitive dissonance condition will be recorded and analyzed to determine any causal relationships between cognitive dissonance and pro-social behavior.\n\n5. In my opinion, the results of the experiment will likely show that higher levels of cognitive dissonance lead to increased pro-social behavior. As individuals experience discomfort due to the inconsistency between their actions and beliefs, they may try to reduce this discomfort by engaging in positive actions, such as helping others, in an attempt to restore balance and maintain a positive self-image. Pro-social behavior may serve as a self-justification mechanism to reconcile the dissonance experienced by the individuals.\n\nOverall, this experiment aims to understand the potential impact of cognitive dissonance on individuals' pro-social behavior and whether the presence of dissonance can be a motivator for positive actions in certain situations."}]}, {"facetValue": "explain a logical fallacy known as \"appeal to worse problems\".", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "explain the concept of \"appeal to worse problems.\""}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "explain a logical fallacy known as \"appeal to worse problems\"."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "2"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is \u201cappeal to worse problems\u201d?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As an AI language model, I can explain the concept of \"appeal to worse problems\", which is a type of logical fallacy.

Personal Egocentrism: This form of egocentrism is characterized by the belief of an individual that their thoughts, experiences, and emotions are more important than other people's. A person that exhibits this form of egocentrism believes that their opinions, beliefs, and values are superior to the views of other people. They often expect others to understand them without necessarily considering the perspective of others. Personal egocentrism is common among young children who may believe that what they see, feel, or think is common to everyone.

Here's a detailed explanation of these two forms:\n\n1. Self-Interested Thinking: Self-interested thinking is a form of egocentrism that involves prioritizing one's own interest over others. This type of thinking is often seen in situations where individuals make decisions based on their own needs, emotions or desires, without considering the impacts of their decisions on others. For example, imagine that someone is applying for a job they really want, and they lie on their resume in a way that could harm their future colleagues. In this situation, the individual is engaging in self-interested thinking, as they prioritize their own desire for the job over the well-being of their future colleagues.\n\n2. Self-Serving Bias: Self-serving bias is a cognitive distortion that involves taking credit for one's successes but blaming failures on external factors or other people. Self-serving bias often leads to overestimating one's abilities and minimizing the role of external factors in one's life. For example, imagine that someone performs well on a test and attributes their success to their intelligence and hard work. However, if they do poorly on a different test, they may attribute their failure to factors outside of their control, such as the test being unfair or the teacher being mean.

Group bias can manifest in many different ways, including discrimination, stereotyping, and resistance to new ideas or perspectives that conflict with the group's views.\n\n2.

IP3 is responsible for inducing a series of calcium oscillations, i.e., Ca2+ is released from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into the cytoplasm and is taken back up into the ER, leading to fluctuations in cytosolic calcium levels.\n\n3. Activation of Calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII): The increased calcium levels activate CaMKII, which is responsible for controlling cell cycle progression.\n\n4. MPF activation: CaMKII phosphorylates specific targets leading to the activation of maturation-promoting factor (MPF) which is a key regulator of meiosis. MPF is composed of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and cyclin B, and its activation promotes the cell to progress from the second meiotic arrest (metaphase II) to anaphase II.\n\n5. Meiosis completion and pronuclear formation: MPF activation leads to the resumption of meiosis, which includes the segregation of homologous chromosomes and extrusion of the second polar body, completing the process of meiosis. Afterward, the oocyte and sperm form pronuclei, which later fuse to create the zygote, marking the beginning of embryogenesis.\n\nSo, in short, calcium activates the meiotic division in the oocyte at fertilization through a series of molecular events, including calcium oscillations, activation of kinases, and regulation of the cell cycle, ultimately leading to the completion of meiosis and the formation of a zygote."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How do acrosmal reaction happens"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The acrosomal reaction is a vital process that occurs during fertilization, allowing the sperm to penetrate the outer layers of the egg and ultimately fuse with the oocyte plasma membrane. Here's an overview of how the acrosomal reaction happens:\n\n1. Sperm approaches the egg: When the sperm approaches the egg (oocyte), it interacts with the outer layers of the egg, which consist of the cumulus cells and the zona pellucida (ZP).\n\n2. Contact with zona pellucida: The sperm binds to the ZP through specific receptors on its surface that interact with glycoproteins in the ZP, such as ZP3. The binding of sperm with the ZP triggers a signaling cascade within the sperm.\n\n3. Increase in intracellular calcium levels: The signaling cascade instigated by ZP binding leads to an influx of calcium ions (Ca\u00b2\u207a) into the sperm. This increase in intracellular calcium levels causes a rapid change in sperm membrane potential, initiating the acrosomal reaction.\n\n4. Acrosomal membrane fusion: As a result of the elevated calcium levels, the outer acrosomal membrane fuses with the plasma membrane of the sperm, creating multiple vesicles called hybrid vesicles. The fusion of these two membranes leads to the exposure of specific membrane components that are involved in the sperm-oocyte fusion process.\n\n5. Release of hydrolytic enzymes: The fusion of the acrosomal and plasma membranes leads to the release of hydrolytic enzymes, such as acrosin and various proteases. These enzymes are responsible for digesting the oocyte's extracellular matrix, particularly the ZP, allowing the sperm to penetrate through.\n\n6. Sperm penetration: As the ZP is degraded by the released enzymes, the sperm cell moves closer to the oocyte plasma membrane. This leads to the establishment of direct contact between the sperm and the oocyte.\n\n7. Fusion of sperm and oocyte membranes: Finally, once the sperm has successfully navigated through the ZP, it fuses with the oocyte plasma membrane, allowing the sperm nucleus and contents to enter the oocyte, leading to fertilization.\n\nIn summary, the acrosomal reaction is a process that starts with the sperm binding to the zona pellucida, leading to an increase in intracellular calcium levels, acrosomal membrane fusion, the release of hydrolytic enzymes, and ultimately, sperm and oocyte fusion."}]}, {"facetValue": "summarize a biological process related to fertilization.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "learn about the process of cleavage formation after fertilization."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "summarize a biological process related to fertilization."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do excatly Cleavage formation Happens After Fertilization (In deep details)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cleavage formation is a process that occurs after fertilization, during which the single-celled zygote undergoes rapid cell division (mitosis) to form the multicellular embryo. This process ultimately leads to the formation of a structure called the blastula. Here is a detailed description of the process:\n\n1. Fertilization: The sperm cell fuses with the egg cell (oocyte) to form the zygote, a single-celled structure with a diploid (2n) number of chromosomes. The zygote contains all the genetic material necessary for the development of the future organism.\n\n2. Activation of the zygote: Fertilization activates the zygote's metabolism, which triggers the onset of cleavage. Activation can involve changes in the concentrations of various ions, the release of intracellular calcium stores, and the initiation of new protein synthesis.\n\n3. First cleavage: The zygote undergoes its first mitotic cell division, which is an asymmetrical division resulting in two daughter cells, called blastomeres. This cleavage is typically longitudinal, dividing the zygote along its long axis. The orientation and positioning of the first cleavage vary across species and can be influenced by the distribution of yolk (nutrient-rich substance) within the egg.\n\n4. Subsequent cleavages: Following the first cleavage, the blastomeres continue to divide rapidly, with each division typically taking place in a synchronized manner. These divisions are known as cleavage divisions, and they result in an increase in cell numbers without a significant increase in the overall size of the embryo.\n\n5. Cleavage patterns: Cleavage patterns can be classified into two main types: holoblastic and meroblastic.\n\n   - Holoblastic cleavage occurs in embryos with little or evenly distributed yolk. In this type, the entire zygote and its subsequent daughter cells undergo complete cell division. Holoblastic cleavage can be further divided into radial, spiral, and bilateral cleavage, depending on the orientation of the cleavage planes.\n   \n   - Meroblastic cleavage is characteristic of embryos with a large amount of yolk concentrated in one region of the egg. In this type, only part of the zygote, the region with little or no yolk, undergoes cell division. Meroblastic cleavage can be further divided into discoidal and superficial cleavage, depending on the position of the dividing cells relative to the yolk mass.\n\n6. Compaction: After several rounds of cleavage, the blastomeres in mammalian embryos begin to adhere more tightly together, forming a compact mass of cells. This process, called compaction, is crucial for the establishment of the first cell-cell interactions and the initiation of cell differentiation.\n\n7. Formation of the blastula: As cleavage continues, the embryo eventually forms a hollowed-out sphere called the blastula. The blastula is characterized by an outer layer of cells called the blastoderm, surrounding a fluid-filled cavity called the blastocoel.\n\n8. Gastrulation: The blastula gives rise to the next stage of embryogenesis, called gastrulation, during which the three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) are formed.\n\nThroughout the cleavage process, various factors, such as species-specific timings, cleavage patterns, spatial organization, and gene regulation, can influence embryo development.

Therefore, ACE2 has become an attractive target for the development of therapeutics and vaccines against COVID-19. In this study, we aimed to generate monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against swine ACE2 (sACE2) using a cell-based immunization method.\n\nFirst, we expressed sACE2 in HEK293T cells and confirmed its expression by Western blot analysis. Then, BALB/c mice were immunized with sACE2-expressing cells to generate a hybridoma library. Hybridoma screening was performed using ELISA and flow cytometry with sACE2-expressing cells. Finally, the mAbs were purified from the supernatants of positive hybridomas using Protein A/G agarose beads.\n\nWe obtained six stable hybridoma clones that produced mAbs against sACE2. The selected mAbs were further characterized using Western blot analysis, ELISA, and flow cytometry. These mAbs specifically recognized sACE2 and did not cross-react with human ACE2 or other related enzymes.\n\nIn conclusion, we established a reliable method for generating mAbs against sACE2 using a cell-based immunization strategy.

They are transparent, gelatinous animals that can be found in marine environments around the world, from the surface down to depths of around 2000 meters. \n\nSalps can range in size from a few millimeters up to several centimeters in length. Despite their simplicity, salps are highly efficient filter feeders, processing large amounts of water to extract small planktonic particles with the help of their mucus net. \n\nThe basic anatomy of salps includes a transparent, gelatinous body consisting of a muscular tube surrounded by a tunic (outer shell) that provides shape and buoyancy. The body is divided into two chambers, with one end forming a feeding apparatus and the other serving as an excurrent siphon to expel waste and water.\n\nSalps have no head or brain, although they do possess a nerve network distributed throughout their body. Unlike other tunicates, salps have no attached, sessile stage in their life cycle. Instead, they are solitary and self-replicating, capable of alternating between sexual and asexual reproduction to adapt to environmental conditions. \n\nIn terms of incorporating salps into a speculative evolution project, some potential avenues to explore could be modifications to their feeding apparatus to better capture specific types of prey or adaptations to allow them to survive in different habitats or at varying water depths. Additionally, their unique reproductive capabilities may provide interesting opportunities for speculating on their evolution in a changing environment."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What anolis species would fare best in a tundra environment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Anoles are a family of small, arboreal lizards that are primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, which means they are not adapted to survive in tundra environments. However, if we were to speculate about which Anolis species would fare best in a tundra environment, we could consider certain traits that may be advantageous in such conditions, such as cold tolerance, adaptations for hibernation, and the ability to cope with low-light conditions.\n\nOne candidate that might potentially survive in a tundra environment could be the green anole (Anolis carolinensis). Although not adapted to cold climates, green anoles are known to be relatively cold-tolerant, having been observed active at temperatures as low as 4\u00b0C. They also have the ability to change color in response to changes in temperature and light, which may help them regulate their body temperature and camouflage themselves in a snowy environment.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that such a survival scenario would require significant adaptation and evolution by the species, over a long period of time. It's also worth considering the ecological and evolutionary impacts of introducing non-native reptile species to new environments, and the potential risks and consequences that may result."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who discovered earth?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The discovery of the Earth cannot be attributed to a single individual or group, as it was already present since the formation of the solar system. However, the concept of the Earth as a planet and its position in the solar system was developed over thousands of years by various civilizations and individuals. \n\nThe ancient Greeks were among the first to propose that the Earth was a sphere, based on observations of eclipses and the curved shadow it cast on the Moon. In the 3rd century BC, the Greek astronomer Eratosthenes accurately calculated the Earth's circumference and developed the concept of latitude and longitude.\n\nThe scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries brought about more advanced understanding of the Earth and its place in the solar system. The Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus proposed the heliocentric model of the solar system, with the Earth and other planets revolving around the sun. This was later supported by the observations and experiments of other scientists such as Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler.\n\nIn the modern era, space exploration and satellite technology have allowed us to study the Earth's surface, atmosphere and position in the solar system in greater detail.

One of the most common polymorphisms in the APOE gene is the presence of three alleles - \u03b52, \u03b53, and \u03b54. The alleles differ by two nucleotide substitutions, resulting in three protein isoforms - ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4, respectively. Genotyping of APOE gene polymorphism is important in various studies to identify the association between APOE polymorphism and specific diseases. Here, we describe a rapid and cost-effective method for genotyping the APOE gene polymorphism.\n\nMaterials Required:\n1. PCR reagents (Taq Polymerase, dNTPs, MgCl2)\n2. APOE-specific primers\n3. DNA samples\n4. Agarose gel electrophoresis setup\n\nMethods:\n1. DNA extraction: Extract DNA using standard procedures from peripheral blood samples or any other tissue source.\n2. PCR amplification: Set up a PCR reaction to amplify the APOE gene using APOE-specific primers. Use universal PCR conditions of 95\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 56\u00b0C for 30 sec, and 72\u00b0C for 45 sec, and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 5 min. The primer sequences for APOE are as follows:\nForward: 5\u2019-TCC AAG GAG CTG CAG GCG GCG CA-3\u2019\nReverse: 5\u2019-CGC GGT CCA GGA GCC TGC AGC CT-3\u2019\n3. Gel electrophoresis: Run the PCR products on a 2% agarose gel and visualize under UV illumination.\n4. Interpretation of gel results: APOE genotyping can be determined by the size of the PCR products. The product sizes are:\nApoE2 allele: 244 bp\nApoE3 allele: 212 bp\nApoE4 allele: 188 bp\nThe presence of two bands on the gel indicates the individual is heterozygous for the two alleles. For example, an individual with the genotype\u03b52/\u03b53 would show two bands, one at 244 bp and the other at 212 bp. The absence of a specific band indicates that the person does not carry that particular Polymorphism.\n\nThis method allows for the identification of the APOE gene polymorphism quickly and cost-effectively. It does not require any advanced equipment, and the result interpretation is relatively easy. The method may be used for population screening, disease association studies, and pharmacogenetic studies."}, {"role": "user", "content": "\u7ffb\u4e00\u4e0b\u8fd9\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4e00\u4e2a\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u5206\u578bAPOE\u57fa\u56e0\u591a\u6001\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\n\n\u8102\u86cb\u767dE\uff08APOE\uff09\u57fa\u56e0\u662f\u8102\u8d28\u4ee3\u8c22\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u6c0f\u75c7\u548c\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u6709\u5173\u3002APOE\u57fa\u56e0\u6700\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u591a\u6001\u6027\u4e4b\u4e00\u662f\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u7b49\u4f4d\u57fa\u56e0-\u03b52\uff0c\u03b53\u548c\u03b54\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b49\u4f4d\u57fa\u56e0\u7684\u533a\u522b\u5728\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u82f7\u9178\u7684\u66ff\u6362\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e09\u79cd\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5f02\u6784\u4f53-ApoE2\uff0cApoE3\u548cApoE4\u3002 APOE\u57fa\u56e0\u591a\u6001\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u5206\u578b\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522bAPOE\u591a\u6001\u6027\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u75be\u75c5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u5206\u578bAPOE\u57fa\u56e0\u591a\u6001\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\n\n\u6240\u9700\u6750\u6599\uff1a\n1.

It includes three main stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation.\n\nGlycolysis: This process takes place in the cytoplasm and splits one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. This produces a small amount of ATP and some reduced coenzymes such as NADH.\n\nKrebs Cycle: Also known as the citric acid cycle, it occurs in the mitochondrial matrix. Pyruvate is converted to acetyl CoA and enters the cycle, where it undergoes several reactions, producing more ATP, NADH, and another reduced coenzyme, FADH2.\n\nOxidative Phosphorylation: This process takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The electrons from NADH and FADH2 pass through the electron transport chain, which results in the pumping of protons across the membrane. This creates an electrochemical gradient, which fuels the production of large quantities of ATP through the enzyme ATP synthase.\n\n2. Anaerobic Respiration: This type of cellular respiration does not require oxygen and mainly happens in prokaryotic organisms or eukaryotic cells under low oxygen conditions. It includes glycolysis, followed by fermentation or anaerobic respiration proper.\n\nFermentation: This process takes place in the cytoplasm after glycolysis. There are two main types of fermentation\u2014alcoholic fermentation and lactic acid fermentation. Both types regenerate NAD+ to allow glycolysis to continue, but they produce different products (ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide for alcoholic fermentation and lactic acid for lactic acid fermentation).\n\nAnaerobic Respiration Proper: Some prokaryotic organisms, such as bacteria and archaea, use alternative electron acceptors instead of oxygen to perform cellular respiration. This can include nitrate, sulfate, or other inorganic molecules.

England's history has been marked by invasions, migrations, and trade, all of which have contributed to shaping its cultural landscape over time.\n\nIn ancient times, England was inhabited by Celtic tribes, who had their own distinct languages and cultures. Then, in the 5th and 6th centuries, the Anglo-Saxons (a group of Germanic tribes) migrated to England, where they established their own kingdoms and mixed with the native Celtic population.\n\nIn the subsequent centuries, England experienced waves of invaders and settlers from different cultures, such as the Vikings (Norse people from Scandinavia) in the 8th and 9th centuries, and the Normans (Norse people who had settled in present-day France) in the 11th century. After the Norman Conquest in 1066, the Normans brought with them new architectural, administrative, artistic, and linguistic influences.\n\nThroughout the Middle Ages, trade and contact with the European mainland exposed England to various cultures, including those of France, Spain, Italy, and Flanders. Later in the Tudor period, trade with countries outside Europe, especially the Ottoman Empire and Africa, increased cultural contacts and influence.\n\nDuring the British Empire period, from the late 16th century to the mid-20th century, England experienced an influx of people, goods, ideas, and cultures from different parts of the world. This period saw the arrival of immigrants from British colonies, such as India, the Caribbean, and Africa, which further contributed to England's cultural diversity.\n\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, additional waves of immigration from European and non-European countries continued to shape England's multicultural society, making it one of the most diverse countries in the world.\n\nTherefore, while England may not have always been multicultural in the modern sense, it has been continuously shaped by diverse cultural influences throughout its history. It is important to note, however, that the extent and impact of cultural diversity have varied across different historical periods."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who were the Yamnana people?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Yamnaya people, also known as the Yamna or Pit Grave culture, were a prehistoric society that lived during the late Copper Age and early Bronze Age (approximately 3300-2600 BCE) in the Pontic-Caspian steppe region, which covers present-day Ukraine, Russia, and parts of Eastern Europe. The Yamnaya people played a crucial role in the development of the Proto-Indo-European culture, and they are considered to be one of the key contributors to the genetic makeup of modern Europeans.\n\nThe name \"Yamnaya\" derives from the Russian word \"yama,\" meaning \"pit\" or \"hole,\" due to the way they buried their dead. The burials typically featured deep, rectangular pits, sometimes containing wooden or stone structures, where the deceased were placed, along with pottery, tools, and other grave goods. The graves were then covered by large mounds of earth (called kurgans), which are a distinguishing feature of the Yamnaya culture.\n\nThe Yamnaya people were among the first Bronze Age societies to use wheeled vehicles and domesticated horses, which greatly increased their mobility and contributed to their rapid expansion into other regions. Their pastoral lifestyle, based on breeding cattle, sheep, and horses, allowed them to thrive in the vast and grassy steppe region.\n\nThe Yamnaya people are of great interest to historians and geneticists due to their potential influence on the spread of Indo-European languages and the genetic contributions they made to various European and Asian populations. Genetic studies have shown that the Yamnaya people contributed significantly to the gene pools of both western and eastern Europe during the late Neolithic and early Bronze Age, which has fueled debates about their role in the spread of Indo-European languages and the formation of later cultures such as the Corded Ware and Bell Beaker cultures."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which modern-day ethnic groups have the closest genetic link to the Yamnaya people?

Some of the groups with the closest genetic links to the Yamnaya are those from Eastern Europe and Northern Europe, including Slavic and Baltic populations. Other populations in Western Europe, such as the British, Irish, Iberians, and Scandinavians, also share genetic ancestry with the Yamnaya people to varying degrees.\n\nIt is important to note that the genetic contribution of Yamnaya people is just one of the many ancestral components in modern European populations. These populations have evolved through complex demographic processes, involving migrations, mixture, and cultural exchanges over thousands of years.\n\nFrom a historical and anthropological perspective, understanding the genetic links between ancient populations like the Yamnaya people and contemporary ethnic groups can provide valuable insights into the patterns of human migration, cultural diffusion, and the spread of languages. These studies help reconstruct the prehistoric past and shape our understanding of human history and cultural development.\n\nHowever, it's essential to approach these genetic connections with caution, as they do not necessarily imply direct cultural or linguistic inheritance from one group to another. Furthermore, overemphasizing genetic links can lead to misconceptions about ethnic identity, oversimplification of cultural heritage, and potential misuse of the information to promote ethnocentric or nationalist narratives.\n\nIn conclusion, while examining the genetic links between the Yamnaya people and modern ethnic groups can reveal valuable information about human prehistory, it's crucial to keep in mind the complexities of human history and consider the broader context in which these genetic connections are situated."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is retrocausality? Does the future really influence the past? How does it work? Does it affect macroscopic things like Humans?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Retrocausality, also known as backward causation or reverse causation, is a concept in philosophy and theoretical physics that proposes that an effect can occur before its cause or that future events can influence past events. While retrocausality is not widely accepted in mainstream science, it has been explored in the context of quantum mechanics, particularly in the interpretations of certain phenomena like entanglement and the delayed-choice experiments.\n\nIn classical physics, the idea of the future influencing the past is generally rejected, as the principle of causality follows a clear progression from past to future. However, quantum mechanics introduced scenarios where the traditional understanding of causality is challenged. One example is the famous double-slit experiment, where particles seem to behave differently based on whether they are being observed or not. This experiment led to the concept of \"delayed-choice,\" where a decision made after a particle passes through a double slit appears to retroactively affect the particle's behavior before the choice was made.\n\nIt is important to note that retrocausality in quantum mechanics is still a topic of debate and does not imply that time travel or direct influence of past events by future events is possible. Instead, it relates to how information about quantum systems is obtained and processed. Some interpretations of quantum mechanics, such as the many-worlds interpretation or the de Broglie-Bohm theory, do not require retrocausality.\n\nAs for macroscopic objects, like humans, the effects of retrocausality have not been observed or demonstrated. Quantum effects typically apply to microscopic particles, and the principles of classical physics still govern the behavior of larger-scale systems, where causality follows the traditional past-to-future direction.\n\nIn summary, retrocausality is an intriguing concept mainly explored in the context of quantum mechanics, and its implications are still debated among physicists. However, there is currently no evidence to support the idea that the future influences the past in macroscopic systems or everyday life."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the de Broglie-Bohm of Quantum Mechanics?

It provides a more intuitive explanation of quantum phenomena compared to the standard Copenhagen interpretation, which can be difficult to visualize due to its reliance on wave-function collapse and the observer's role.\n\nIn simple terms, the de Broglie-Bohm theory combines aspects of both wave and particle descriptions of quantum entities. It proposes that particles, such as electrons, have definite positions and follow well-defined trajectories at all times, but their motion is guided by a \"pilot wave\" (also called the quantum wave). The wave is represented by the wave function, which is the same mathematical object used in the Copenhagen interpretation.\n\nThe pilot wave governs the dynamics of the particles, and its interference pattern (just like in the double-slit experiment) determines the probability distribution of a particle's position. However, in the de Broglie-Bohm theory, the particle always has a definite position, even when not observed. This idea contradicts the Copenhagen interpretation, which asserts that until a measurement is made, particles exist in a superposition of states without defined locations.\n\nIn summary, the de Broglie-Bohm theory offers an alternative viewpoint on quantum mechanics, involving particles with definite positions and trajectories guided by an accompanying wave. It avoids some of the conceptual challenges posed by the more mainstream Copenhagen interpretation, but it's important to note that both interpretations provide equivalent mathematical predictions and are consistent with experimental results.

Copenhagen interpretation: This is the most widely taught interpretation, which asserts that wave functions provide probabilities of measurement outcomes, and that the act of measuring causes the wave function to collapse, resulting in a definite state.\n\n2. Many-worlds interpretation: This interpretation suggests that all possible outcomes of quantum events actually occur, and each outcome exists in a separate, non-communicating parallel universe or \"branch\" of the universal wave function.\n\n3. De Broglie-Bohm theory (Pilot-wave theory): As previously explained, this interpretation posits that particles have definite positions and follow well-defined trajectories guided by pilot waves.\n\n4. Consistent histories: This interpretation provides a framework for consistently describing the probabilities of sequences of events or \"histories\" without invoking wave function collapse or hidden variables.\n\n5. Quantum Bayesianism (QBism): This interpretation views quantum mechanics as a subjective probability theory that relates to an observer's expectations and experiences, rather than an objective description of reality.\n\nSince all these interpretations yield the same predictions in terms of experimental results, the choice of the \"correct\" interpretation often comes down to personal philosophical preferences and the way one wants to understand the underlying nature of quantum reality.

Cholesterol is a type of lipid (fat) molecule that is an essential component of cell membranes, especially in the brain. The brain has a higher concentration of cholesterol than any other organ, and about 25% of the total cholesterol in the human body is found in the brain. \n\nCholesterol plays a crucial role in the brain by helping to maintain the structural integrity and fluidity of neuronal cell membranes, modulating the activity of certain neurotransmitter receptors, and serving as a precursor for the synthesis of important molecules, such as steroid hormones and vitamin D. However, it is important to note that cholesterol in the brain is mostly synthesized locally and is separate from the cholesterol found in the bloodstream. \n\nIn summary, while cholesterol is a significant component of the human brain and plays a critical role in its function, the brain is not made entirely of cholesterol. It is made of various components, including neurons, glial cells, extracellular matrix, blood vessels, and cerebrospinal fluid, as previously mentioned."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Are statins bad for the brain?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Statins are a class of drugs used to lower cholesterol levels in the body, primarily to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. They work by inhibiting an enzyme (HMG-CoA reductase) that plays a key role in the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver.\n\nAs for the effect of statins on the brain, the relationship is complex and not entirely understood. Some studies suggest that statins may have a positive impact on the brain by reducing the risk of dementia and improving cognitive function. This could be due to their ability to reduce inflammation, improve blood flow, and lower the risk of vascular diseases, which can affect brain health. In these cases, statins might be beneficial.\n\nHowever, some reports and studies have raised concerns about potential negative effects of statins on cognitive function, with some people experiencing memory impairment or cognitive decline after starting statin therapy. It is important to note that these occurrences are relatively rare and usually reversible upon discontinuing the medication.\n\nThe potential risk of cognitive side effects from statins must be weighed against the benefits of statin treatment for preventing heart disease and stroke, especially in patients with a high risk of cardiovascular events. If you are concerned about potential side effects or interactions between statins and your brain health, it is essential to consult with your healthcare provider to discuss your individual risks and benefits and find the best course of action for managing your cholesterol levels and overall health."}]}, {"facetValue": "review the relationship between cerebral blood flow and white matter injury.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "review the relationship between cerebral blood flow and white matter injury."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "review the relationship between cerebral blood flow and white matter injury."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "Please briefly review the relationship between cerebral blood flow and white matter injury"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cerebral blood flow is crucial for the proper functioning of the brain.

Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Probability of an event: The probability of an event occurring is the number of ways the event can happen divided by the total number of possible outcomes. For example, if we flip a fair coin, the probability of getting heads is 0.5. We can calculate this in Python as follows:\n\n```\n# Probability of getting heads on a fair coin flip\np_heads = 0.5\n```\n\n2. Probability distribution: A probability distribution describes how the probabilities are distributed across different possible outcomes. Common probability distributions include the uniform distribution, normal distribution, and binomial distribution. We can use specific functions in Python's `scipy.stats` module to represent and calculate probabilities from these distributions. For example, to get the probability density function (PDF) of a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1, we can use:\n\n```\nimport scipy.stats as stats\n\n# Probability density function of a standard normal distribution\nx = 0\nmu = 0\nsigma = 1\npdf = stats.norm.pdf(x, mu, sigma)\n```\n\n3. Conditional probability: Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. We can calculate this using the formula `P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)`. For example, if we know that 80% of men and 60% of women have brown eyes, and we randomly select a person with brown eyes, what is the probability that they are a man? We can calculate this in Python as follows:\n\n```\n# Probability of selecting a man with brown eyes\np_man = 0.5\np_brown_given_man = 0.8\np_brown_given_woman = 0.6\n\n# Probability of selecting a person with brown eyes\np_brown = p_man * p_brown_given_man + (1-p_man) * p_brown_given_woman\n\n# Probability of selecting a man given that the person has brown eyes\np_man_given_brown = p_man * p_brown_given_man / p_brown\n```\n\nThese are just a few examples of how we can calculate probabilities in Python, depending on the specific problem or situation."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Create a stacked bar plot code with counting number in y axis"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's an example code to create a stacked bar plot with counting numbers on the y-axis using Matplotlib:\n\n```\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Example data\nlabels = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']\nmen_count = [23, 56, 32, 10]\nwomen_count = [40, 12, 18, 24]\n\n# Create figure and axis objects\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Create stacked bar plot\nax.bar(labels, men_count, label='Men')\nax.bar(labels, women_count, bottom=men_count, label='Women')\n\n# Add counts on y-axis\nax.set_ylabel('Count')\nax.set_yticks(np.arange(0, max(men_count)+max(women_count), 10))\n\n# Add legend and x-axis label\nax.legend()\nax.set_xlabel('Category')\n\n# Show plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this example, we have two sets of data: one for the count of men and one for the count of women, for each of four categories (A, B, C, and D).

Introduction\nThe renal system or urinary system consists of the kidneys, ureters, the urinary bladder, and the urethra. The primary function of the renal system is to maintain homeostasis by regulating the composition, volume, and pressure of blood as well as blood pH. The kidneys produce urine, and the rest of the renal system transports, stores, and eliminates urine. In this explanation, we will discuss the anatomy (including location, arteries, veins, and nerves), histology, and physiology of each part of the renal system according to textbooks.\n\nII. Kidneys\nA. Anatomy\n1. Location: The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs located retroperitoneally on either side of the vertebral column, between the T12 and L3 vertebrae. The right kidney is slightly lower than the left, due to the displacement caused by the presence of the liver.\n2. Arteries: Each kidney is supplied by a renal artery, which branches off from the abdominal aorta. The renal artery further divides into segmental arteries, interlobar arteries, arcuate arteries, and interlobular arteries to supply oxygenated blood to the kidney.\n3. Veins: The veins of the kidneys mirror the arterial supply. They begin as interlobular veins, which converge to form arcuate veins, interlobar veins, and finally the renal vein. Each renal vein drains into the inferior vena cava.\n4. Nerves: The kidneys receive autonomic innervation from the renal plexus, which includes sympathetic fibers from the T10-L1 spinal segments and parasympathetic fibers from the vagus nerve.\n\nB. Histology\nThe kidney consists of an outer cortex and an inner medulla. The cortex contains renal corpuscles, which consist of the glomerulus and the Bowman\u2019s capsule, as well as proximal and distal convoluted tubules. The medulla consists of the loops of Henle and collecting ducts. The basic functional unit of the kidney is the nephron, which consists of the renal corpuscle, proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle, and distal convoluted tubule.\n\nC. Physiology\nThe kidneys perform three main functions: filtration, reabsorption, and secretion. These processes occur in the nephrons, which produce urine as the final product. Filtration occurs in the renal corpuscles, where the glomerulus filters blood to form an ultrafiltrate, which enters the Bowman\u2019s capsule. Reabsorption involves the transfer of substances from the renal tubules (mainly proximal and distal tubules) into the peritubular capillaries, thus returning these substances to the blood. Lastly, secretion is the process by which substances (such as potassium and hydrogen ions) are transported from the peritubular capillaries into the tubular fluid.\n\nIII. Ureters\nA. Anatomy\n1. Location: Ureters are muscular tubes that originate from the renal pelvis (located at the hilum of each kidney) and transport urine to the urinary bladder.\n2. Arteries: The ureters receive blood supply from several arteries, including the renal arteries, gonadal arteries, and branches from the abdominal aorta and inferior vesical arteries.\n3. Veins: The blood from the ureters drains into the renal, gonadal, and vesical veins, which ultimately drain into the inferior vena cava or the common iliac veins.\n4. Nerves: The ureters receive autonomic innervation from the renal, aortic, and pelvic plexuses.\n\nB. Histology\nThe wall of the ureter consists of three layers: the inner mucosa, the middle muscularis, and the outer adventitia. The mucosa is lined by transitional epithelium, which allows for the expansion of the ureter during urine transport. The muscularis consists of smooth muscle that propels urine through the ureter via peristalsis.\n\nC. Physiology\nThe primary function of the ureters is to transport urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder through peristalsis.\n\nIV. Urinary Bladder\nA. Anatomy\n1. Location: The urinary bladder is a hollow, muscular organ located in the pelvic cavity, posterior to the pubic symphysis.\n2. Arteries: The bladder receives blood supply primarily from the superior and inferior vesical arteries, a branch of the internal iliac artery.\n3. Veins: The blood from the bladder drains into the vesical venous plexus, which empties into the internal iliac veins.\n4. Nerves: The bladder is innervated by the pelvic plexus and receives both parasympathetic (from the S2-S4 spinal segments) and sympathetic (from the L1-L2 spinal segments) fibers.\n\nB. Histology\nThe wall of the urinary bladder consists of three layers: the mucosa, the muscularis, and the outer adventitia or serosa. The mucosa is lined by transitional epithelium that allows the bladder to expand during filling. The muscularis, also known as the detrusor muscle, consists of smooth muscle fibers arranged in three layers (inner and outer longitudinal, middle circular) that contract to expel urine during micturition.\n\nC. Physiology\nThe primary function of the urinary bladder is to store urine produced by the kidneys until it is eliminated via the urethra.\n\nV. Urethra\nA. Anatomy\n1. Location: The urethra is a narrow tube that extends from the neck of the urinary bladder to the external urethral orifice. The male urethra is longer (18-20 cm) compared to the female urethra (4 cm).\n2. Arteries: The urethra receives blood supply from the internal pudendal and inferior vesical arteries.\n3. Veins: The blood from the urethra drains into the internal pudendal and vesical veins, ultimately draining into the internal iliac vein.\n4. Nerves: The urethra receives autonomic (parasympathetic and sympathetic) and somatic innervation from the pudendal nerve and pelvic plexus.\n\nB. Histology\nThe wall of the urethra consists of three layers: the mucosa, the muscularis, and the outer adventitia. The mucosa is lined by stratified squamous or pseudostratified columnar epithelium, depending on the region of the urethra.\n\nC. Physiology\nThe function of the urethra is to facilitate the passage of urine from the urinary bladder to the external environment during micturition. In males, the urethra also functions as a reproductive structure, allowing for the passage of semen during ejaculation."}]}, {"facetValue": "describe renal arteries and to discuss a case of a non-functioning thyroid adenoma.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "obtain information about a thyroid adenoma in a female patient without symptoms or hormonal defects."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "describe renal arteries and to discuss a case of a non-functioning thyroid adenoma."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "describes renal all renal arteries in sample form from textbooks "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The renal arteries are crucial components of the renal system, ensuring optimal blood flow to the kidneys. There are several types of renal arteries, which can be described in sample form below:\n\n1. Main Renal Arteries: The primary renal arteries branch directly from the abdominal aorta and enter the kidneys at the hilum on each side. They are responsible for delivering blood to the kidneys, where it will be filtered and processed in the renal system. In general, humans have one main renal artery on each side, supplying the left and right kidneys, although variations can occur.\n\n2. Accessory Renal Arteries: Some individuals may have one or more additional renal arteries \u2013 referred to as accessory renal arteries. These extra arteries may branch off from the abdominal aorta or other nearby vessels, such as the lumbar, ovarian, or testicular arteries. Accessory renal arteries usually supply blood to the same kidney as the main renal artery, but they can also supply a part of the contralateral kidney in some cases.\n\n3. Segmental Renal Arteries: The main renal artery divides into segmental arteries as it enters the hilum of the kidney. Typically, there are five segmental arteries within each kidney: the apical, anterior superior, anterior inferior, posterior, and inferior segmental arteries. These vessels supply blood to specific segments or areas of the renal cortex and medulla.\n\n4. Interlobar Arteries: Segmental renal arteries further branch into interlobar arteries that traverse the renal parenchyma in the region between the medullary pyramids, known as the renal columns. Interlobar arteries supply blood to the renal cortex and medulla within the renal lobes.\n\n5. Arcuate Arteries: As the interlobar arteries reach the border between the renal cortex and medulla, they give rise to arcuate arteries, which run along the base of the renal pyramids parallel to the renal capsule. The arcuate arteries supply the outer cortical zone and give rise to the interlobular arteries.\n\n6. Interlobular Arteries: The arcuate arteries give rise to smaller branches called interlobular arteries, which penetrate the renal cortex, running perpendicular to the arcuate arteries. Interlobular arteries supply the renal cortex and give rise to afferent arterioles that lead to the glomerulus in the renal corpuscles.\n\nThese arteries work together to ensure that blood reaches the various regions of the kidneys, where it undergoes crucial filtering and detoxification processes.

Clinical history and physical examination: This step involves gathering information about the patient's medical history, including any known kidney disease, family history of renal disorders, medications, and lifestyle factors. Identifying specific clinical symptoms, such as changes in urine output or color, edema, hypertension, flank pain, or systemic symptoms like fatigue and weight loss, may help narrow down the potential renal disease entities. A thorough physical examination should be performed to assess fluid status, blood pressure, and any manifestation of edema.

Urinalysis: This test helps evaluate urinary sediment, proteinuria, and hematuria. The presence of red and white blood cells casts, crystal formations, or proteinuria may indicate specific renal diseases such as glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis, or nephrotic syndrome.\n\n  b. Blood tests: Measurements of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and electrolytes can assess kidney function and provide information about potential renal diseases. High levels of creatinine and BUN, as well as abnormal electrolyte levels, may suggest acute or chronic kidney injury.\n\n3. Imaging studies: Renal ultrasound is often the first-line imaging modality for assessing renal morphology and size, detecting renal cysts, hydronephrosis, and kidney stones, all of which could cause renal dysfunction. Additional imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be warranted depending on the clinical suspicion.\n\n4.

The biopsy involves obtaining a small kidney tissue sample, which can be examined under a microscope to provide a histologic diagnosis and guide therapy.\n\nTreatment of renal diseases depends on identifying the specific disorder and its underlying cause. Depending on the diagnosis, potential treatment options can include:\n\n1. Medical management: This includes interventions such as blood pressure control (with the use of antihypertensive agents such as ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers), strict glycemic control in diabetics, treating infections with antibiotics, adjusting medications associated with kidney injury, and correction of electrolyte abnormalities.\n\n2. Lifestyle modifications: Patients should be educated on maintaining a healthy diet, including sodium and protein restriction in certain cases, and maintaining an adequate fluid intake. Smoking cessation and weight loss should also be encouraged as needed.\n\n3. Pharmacological treatment of the specific disease: For example, corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents are often used for glomerulonephritis, while specific antiviral or immunomodulatory therapies may be employed for lupus nephritis or other immune-mediated renal diseases.\n\n4.

This article aims to provide insights into the present understanding of gluconeogenesis in podocytes and its influence on DN while highlighting the potential therapeutic possibilities to combat this debilitating complication of diabetes mellitus (DM).\n\nIntroduction:\nDiabetic nephropathy (DN) is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) characterized by glomerular hypertrophy, basement membrane thickening, mesangial expansion, and eventually glomerulosclerosis. Podocytes, the highly specialized cells that cover the outer layer of glomerular basement membrane, play an essential role in maintaining the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier. In the context of DN, podocytes are subjected to various stresses such as hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance which cause detrimental effects on their structure and function.\n\nGluconeogenesis, a metabolic pathway that generates glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors, has been traditionally recognized to occur primarily in the liver and kidneys. However, recent investigations have unveiled the existence of this pathway in podocytes, leading to a paradigm shift in the understanding of the role of podocytes in glucose homeostasis and DN. The activation and regulation of gluconeogenesis in podocytes are complex and controlled by various factors, including hormones, signaling molecules, and transcriptional regulators.\n\nRole of Gluconeogenesis in Podocytes:\nThe upregulation of gluconeogenesis in podocytes under hyperglycemic conditions has been reported in several studies. The activation of this pathway is considered a coping mechanism by which podocytes generate their glucose supply to meet energy requirements and maintain normal cellular function. Gluconeogenesis may be beneficial under mild and transient hyperglycemic conditions. However, persistent and uncontrolled activation of this pathway may contribute to podocyte injury and the development or progression of DN.\n\nIt has been observed that upregulated gluconeogenesis in podocytes can result in the generation of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to oxidative stress and inflammation. Furthermore, insulin resistance and impaired insulin signaling have been demonstrated in podocytes under hyperglycemic conditions, which are known to contribute to the activation of the gluconeogenic pathway. This may further potentiate metabolic disturbances and exacerbate podocyte damage, ultimately leading to DN.\n\nTherapeutic Possibilities:\nTargeting gluconeogenesis modulation in podocytes presents potential therapeutic strategies against DN. Currently, therapeutic interventions for DN primarily aim to control blood glucose levels, renal hemodynamics, and blood pressure. However, considering the emerging role of gluconeogenesis in podocytes, new strategies could include the modulation of key enzymes and regulators that control this pathway. Inhibition of excessive gluconeogenesis while preserving essential glucose production could represent an ideal approach. For example, pharmacological inhibitors of gluconeogenic enzymes or the use of small molecules to target specific transcription factors could provide opportunities for maintaining metabolic homeostasis in podocytes and, consequently, mitigating DN progression.\n\nConclusion:\nGluconeogenesis in podocytes represents a novel and intriguing aspect of DN pathophysiology that demands further exploration. Understanding the precise regulatory mechanisms and the consequences of altered gluconeogenesis in podocytes will provide insights into the interplay between glucose metabolism, podocyte function, and DN. The development of targeted therapies to modulate gluconeogenesis in podocytes may represent a promising strategy to improve the management of DN and decrease its devastating consequences such as ESRD and cardiovascular complications. Further research is needed to decipher the intricate regulatory network of gluconeogenesis in podocytes while exploring its potential as a therapeutic target."}]}]}], "numConvs": 21}, {"summary": "Performed analyses on chicken crowing behavior and human-monkey evolutionary relationship", "name": "Perform evolutionary and animal behavior analyses", "children": [{"summary": "Analyze and explain scientific concepts related to animal behavior and biology.", "name": "Analyze Chicken Crowing Behavior", "children": [], "numConvs": 1, "conversations": [{"facetValue": "evaluate the validity of a statement about animal cooperation and provide a scientific analysis with evidence and theoretical support.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "discuss whether the statement \"Animals only cooperate for immediate personal benefit\" is accurate from a behavioral ecology perspective, using theoretical explanations and empirical evidence."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "evaluate the validity of a statement about animal cooperation and provide a scientific analysis with evidence and theoretical support."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "\u201cAnimals only cooperate for immediate personal benefit\u201d.

This behaviour is seen across the animal kingdom, from microbes and insects to birds and mammals. The statement in question argues that animals only cooperate for immediate personal benefit. From the perspective of a behavioural ecologist, this statement can be challenged through the examination of various theories within the field, alongside empirical evidence observed in multiple animal species.\n\nOne of the key theories surrounding cooperation among animals is kin selection, which asserts that individuals are more likely to cooperate with close relatives to maximize their inclusive fitness, that is the effect of an individual's actions on its own as well as its relatives' reproductive success. Inclusive fitness is an essential concept for theoretical explanations of cooperation, introduced by Hamilton (1964) in his seminal work, which highlighted the importance of relatedness in cooperative behaviours. This theory challenges the notion that animals only cooperate for immediate personal benefit since kin selection entails that cooperation may be directed towards relatives who do not always reciprocate \u2013 thereby conferring indirect fitness benefits to the actor.\n\nEmpirical examples to support kin selection and its implications on cooperative behaviour can be found in multiple species across the animal kingdom. The social behaviour of eusocial insects, such as ants, bees, and termites, provides a prime example of this theory in action. In these insect societies, cooperation is observed among thousands to millions of individuals within a single colony where the majority of individuals are sterile workers that forego their own reproduction in service of the queen and her offspring (Wilson and H\u00f6lldobler, 2005). Clearly, this cooperative behaviour cannot be explained by an immediate personal benefit to the individuals involved, as the sterile workers will never reproduce. Instead, cooperation in eusocial insects is driven by the indirect fitness benefits that the relatedness among colony members confers.\n\nAnother example of cooperative behaviour that does not rely on immediate personal benefits is found in cooperative breeding, which is prevalent in certain bird and mammal species, such as Florida scrub-jays, meerkats, and naked mole rats. In these species, some individuals forego their own reproduction and assist in raising the offspring of another individual, most often a close relative (Clutton-Brock, 2002). This behaviour can be demonstrated in meerkats (Suricata suricatta), where subordinate individuals assume roles in raising the alpha pair's offspring, which includes feeding, babysitting and protecting them from predators. This kind of cooperation is more likely observed amongst kin, where the inclusive fitness benefits are deemed sufficient for such investments (Russell et al., 2002).\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that not all animal cooperation can be explained by kin selection. Reciprocity is another important mechanism in cooperative behaviours, which posits that individuals cooperate with others for potential future benefits, rather than immediate personal gains (Trivers, 1971; Axelrod, and Hamilton, 1981). The notion of delayed personal benefits through reciprocal cooperation goes against the statement in question. In this context, empirical evidence of cooperation in the absence of kinship, often referred to as reciprocal altruism, can be found in certain animal species.\n\nOne of the most well-known examples of reciprocal cooperation in animals is observed in the grooming behaviour of primates. In many primate species, such as chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), olive baboons (Papio anubis) and vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus), individuals have been observed forming grooming relationships that confer benefits in the form of reduced stress, parasite removal, and increased social bonds (Schino and Aureli, 2009). Evidence suggests that these grooming acts can be reciprocated over extended periods, highlighting that the benefits of this cooperative behaviour may not be immediate, but rather delayed (Schino, 2001).\n\nFurther examples of reciprocity-based cooperation can be found in cleaner fish and their clients. Cleaner fish, such as the Caribbean cleaning gobies and the Indo-Pacific cleaner wrasses, consume ectoparasites from their client fish, a behaviour that can be observed in reef habitats (Bshary and Grutter, 2006). Studies have shown that cleaner fish attend to their clients' needs, and the clients reciprocate by not consuming the cleaner fish (Bshary et al., 2008). This mutual benefit is not immediate but operates on the principle that the cooperation provides a better outcome over time for both parties.\n\nIn summary, the statement that animals only cooperate for immediate personal benefit can be challenged from the perspective of a behavioural ecologist. Theoretical explanations for cooperation, such as kin selection, and empirical evidence derived from various animal species, demonstrate that cooperative behaviours can be carried out to confer indirect fitness benefits or future benefits through mechanisms such as reciprocity. Collaborative behaviours observed in eusocial insects, cooperative breeders, and some primate species provide strong evidence to suggest that animals do not always cooperate for solely immediate personal gains but can also do so for indirect, or delayed, advantageous outcomes."}]}]}, {"summary": "Analyze and interpret monkey behavior, thoughts, and the scientific validity of theories related to human evolution.", "name": "Analyze Human-Monkey Evolutionary Relationship", "children": [], "numConvs": 3, "conversations": [{"facetValue": "evaluate the plausibility of an elephant learning to peel a banana and rate confidence in the answer.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "evaluate the plausibility of an elephant learning to peel a banana."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "evaluate the plausibility of an elephant learning to peel a banana and rate confidence in the answer."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is it plausible that an elephant could learn to peel a banana if it never saw anything else do that?

Therefore, the following section discusses the key findings regarding general knowledge of SJH, diagnostic criteria, treatment and its effectiveness, education received, and training needs.\n\n2.3.1 general knowledge of SJH\n\nThe general understanding of JH and SJH was evaluated. This includes the prevalence, whether the condition is inherited or acquired, whether it is more prevalent in males or females, tissues affected by SJH, and the ethnic group in which JH is more prevalent. The reported results were mixed between studies. For example majority believed it could be inherited (Rombaut et al., 2015, Lyell et al., 2016), in other study, they underestimated its prevalence (Russek et al., 2016). Comparatively, fewer than half of respondents were aware that hypermobility could be acquired (Lyell et al., 2016). This discrepancy limits our ability to assume that participants had a solid understanding of the general epidemiological factors.\n\n2.3.2 Assessment knowledge \n\nIn terms of assessment,  a range of assessment tools were utilized by physiotherapists, ,such as the Beighton score, Brighton criteria, Villefranche criteria, five partquestionnaire , Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) and the 6 Minute Walk Test (MWT). However, it was noted that majority of physiotherapists had a lack of knowledge and confidence about the use of theses assessment tools with their patients.  This was due to the fact that SJH evaluations were not routinely undertaken in the physiotherapy clinic (Rombaut et al., 2015). In addition, the ability to differentiate GH from JHS was likewise poor(Billings et al., 2015, Lyell et al., 2016). Interestingly, the level of confidence in the assessment is related to received training (P < 0.001) not to the years of experience (Rombaut et al., 2015, Lyell et al., 2016, Billings et al., 2015). In addition, an association was found between familiarity with the diagnostic test and educational level. (Russek et al., 2016).  A higher level of education increases confidence in the ability to diagnose.\n\n2.3.3 Treatment knowledge \na large variety of treatment approaches were utilized in treating patients (Lyell et al., 2016, Billings et al., 2015). One study found 80% of respondents believed that education and reassurance, home exercises, proprioception, closed chain exercises, postural education and orthotics lead to good outcomes with those patient (Billings et al., 2015).Furthermore, strengthening exercise , was considered as an appropriate physical therapy management for this condition by most responders (Russek et al., 2016, Rombaut et al., 2015). Whereas, stretching, electrotherapy and heat was not considered effective (Russek et al., 2016, Rombaut et al., 2015). \nIn terms of medical management, one study found that most participants considered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, pain medication, and surgery as typical management for these patients (Russek et al., 2016).\nHowever, most of the participants had less confidence in treating patients with SJH  (Russek et al., 2016, Rombaut et al., 2015). \n\n2.3.3 Education received \nA significant percentage of physiotherapists have reported that they have not received training in hypermobility. The study revealed that 51% of respondents had not received any training, while only 10% had undergone training at an undergraduate level (Lyell et al., 2016). A similar trend was observed in the US, where only 24.1% of therapists had learned about JHS in school, and 13.8% received continuing education (Russek et al., 2016). The findings suggest that there is a need for more education and training to enhance the knowledge and management of these conditions among physiotherapists.\n\n2.3.3 Training needs \nThe studies found that a high percentage of respondents (80% to 97%) expressed a need for further training  and continuing professional development (CPD) training (Lyell et al., 2016, Rombaut et al., 2015, Billings et al., 2015). A noteworthy result was that a higher number of participants stated that they had not received education on JHS compared to FMS, JRA, and ARA, and this difference was statistically significant (p<0.001) (Russek et al., 2016).\n\n2.3.3 Limitation  \n\nHowever, results of the studies must be taken with caution as above 80% of the responders had more than five years of experience (Billings et al., 2015, Lyell et al., 2016, Rombaut et al., 2015). This might be due to a lack of confidence in responding among less experienced therapists. In addition, finding suggests that the responders who reported having higher education were more likely to be knowledgeable about JHS (Russek et al., 2016). Therefore, the study may have overestimated the level of knowledge of physical therapists about SJH, as those with more education and advanced certifications were overrepresented in the sample.\n\n\n2.3.3 Knowledge \u2013 Musculoskeletal\nThe study found that among the musculoskeletal features associated with SJH, physiotherapists correctly acknowledged laxity and dislocation/suluxation as the most common ones, followed by proprioceptive deficit, muscle weakness, and chronic pain. However, about 40% of the respondents had no idea whether other symptoms were characteristic of SJH. \nAs for non-musculoskeletal features, the majority of respondents had no knowledge of their association with SJH, and those who did were mostly aware of fatigue, striae, and delayed wound healing, but less than 20% recognized autonomic dysfunction, prolapse, anxiety, and depression as symptoms of SJH.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This section summarizes the findings of four studies that investigate physical therapists' knowledge, diagnosis, treatment, education, and training needs related to joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS) and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome - hypermobility type (EDS-HT).

The structure and function of these transporters have been extensively studied, and it has been found that they are conserved across species from bacteria to humans. Furthermore, their dysfunction has been associated with various diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, multidrug resistance in cancer, and cholesterol transport-related disorders.\n\nIn terms of structure, ABC transporters are characterized by four core domains: two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). The transmembrane domains are composed of multiple alpha-helical segments that span the lipid bilayer. These segments provide a pathway for the substrate to pass through the membrane. The nucleotide-binding domains, as the name implies, are responsible for binding ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the cellular energy currency. These domains contain conserved motifs, such as the Walker A and Walker B motifs, that contribute to ATP-binding and hydrolysis. The NBDs typically reside in the cytoplasm and connect to the TMDs via short intracellular loops. The arrangement of TMDs and NBDs may vary among different ABC transporter subfamilies.\n\nThe function of ABC transporters primarily relies on the conformational changes induced by ATP binding and hydrolysis. In the resting state, the TMDs form a closed pore that prevents the movement of substrate through the membrane. Upon ATP binding to the NBDs, the TMDs undergo a series of conformational changes that results in the opening of a pore that allows the substrate to pass through. Simultaneously, the NBDs dimerize and form a sandwich-like structure that encapsulates the bound ATP molecules. The hydrolysis of ATP to ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate provides the energy necessary to reset the transporter to its original conformation, releasing the substrate on the opposite side of the membrane and resetting the cycle.\n\nThe substrates transported by ABC transporters can vary widely, from small ions and molecules to large polypeptides, with some transporters showing a high degree of specificity toward certain substrates. Moreover, the direction of transport can differ among various ABC transporter subfamilies, resulting in the import or export of substrates from the cell.\n\nIn conclusion, ATP-binding cassette transporters are a highly conserved family of transmembrane proteins responsible for the transport of a vast array of substrates across cellular membranes. Their structure, consisting of two transmembrane domains and two nucleotide-binding domains, allows for the energy-dependent, controlled transport of substrates, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper functioning."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a conclusion based on this abstract: The fungal species Candida glabrata has demonstrated azole resistance in clinical isolates (1).

Prescription requirements: Prescriptions for both types of drugs must include the patient's name and address, the drug name, strength, dosage form, quantity prescribed, directions for use, and the prescriber's information like name, address, and DEA registration number. Additionally, electronic prescribing is required for both types of drugs in most cases.\n\n2.

Prescriptions: Schedule II prescriptions are limited to a 30-day supply with no refills (with some exceptions). Schedule IV prescriptions, including benzodiazepines, may be written for a larger supply (up to 180 days) with refills, as long as the total quantity prescribed does not exceed a 180-day supply.\n\n2. Prescriptive authority: Some practitioners with limited DEA registrations, like nurse practitioners and physician assistants, may have more flexibility in prescribing benzodiazepines compared to Schedule II substances.\n\n3. Dispensing restrictions: Schedule II substances have more stringent restrictions regarding the oral transmission of prescriptions (limited to emergency situations) and the partial filling of prescriptions. These restrictions generally do not apply to benzodiazepines.\n\nIn conclusion, while benzodiazepines do not follow the exact same rules as Schedule II substances, there are similarities in their regulation and restrictions in New York State.

These isolates represent five different clades and vary in ability to produce hyphae and biofilm (11, 13). Genome sequence analysis by Hirakawa et al. (11) indicated that the average genome-wide nucleotide diversity between any two isolates is ~0.37%. To increase confidence in gene expression differences among these isolates, we repeated triplicate RNA-seq assays for the five clinical isolates and efg1\u0394/\u0394 derivatives after hyphal induction for 4\u2009h in RPMI plus fetal bovine serum (RPMI+FBS) at 37\u00b0C (see Data Set S1 in the supplemental material, all genes). Analysis of the pooled data sets defined a set of 200 genes that presented significant Efg1-responsive RNA levels in all strains (>2-fold change between efg1\u0394/\u0394 and WT; adjusted P < 0.05). We refer to these 200 genes as core Efg1-responsive genes (see Data Set S1, down and up data). Data set comparisons also identified 1,051 genes with Efg1-responsive RNA levels in only one or a few strains. We refer to these 1,051 genes as strain-limited Efg1-responsive genes (see Data Set S1, down and up); they represent natural variation in the Efg1 regulatory circuit. We sought to determine the basis for this natural variation.\nOne possible explanation for variation in Efg1-responsive genes is that Efg1 binds to distinct genomic loci in each strain. Differences in the binding spectrum would lead to different consequences for loss of Efg1. To identify loci to which Efg1 binds, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis of epitope-tagged Efg1-hemagglutinin (Efg1-HA) in each clinical isolate background. Samples were prepared after hyphal induction for 4\u2009h in RPMI+FBS at 37\u00b0C. Efg1-HA presented consistent binding loci in all five clinical isolates (Fig. 1A; see also Data Set S2). Pearson's coefficients for 500-bp bins across the genome indicated that samples correlated strongly, with R values ranging from 0.85 to 1.00 (Fig. 1B). Computed Efg1 binding motifs for each clinical isolate showed that bound regions were associated with the canonical Efg1 binding motif, 5\u2032-TGCAT-3\u2032 (Fig. 1C). These results argue that Efg1-target binding is largely uniform among the five C. albicans isolates.\n\nEfg1 core network of direct target genes.\nWe merged RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data to identify genes that were both differentially expressed in efg1\u0394/\u0394 mutants and bound by Efg1. This analysis showed that 218 to 299 genes were regulated directly by Efg1 in each clinical isolate, and 110 genes were regulated directly by Efg1 in all five clinical isolates (Fig. 2; see also Table S1, Efg1 direct target gene ID and core direct Efg1 targets). The 110 genes, which we call core direct Efg1 targets, included 85 Efg1-activated genes and 25 Efg1-repressed genes (Fig. 3A). Core direct targets were enriched for functions related to adhesion and biofilm formation (adhesion of symbiont to host, P\u2009=\u20091.48e\u221206; single-species biofilm formation, P\u2009=\u20098.87e\u221206), in keeping with the observation that Efg1 is required for biofilm formation in all clinical isolates tested (13).\nExamination of binding peaks surrounding specific genes indicated that Efg1 binding differences were not the cause of regulatory differences among strains. For example, core direct targets UME6, ALS3, and HGC1 were under positive control by Efg1 in all strains examined (Fig. 3B; see also Table S1, core direct Efg1 targets). The 5\u2032 regions of these genes were uniformly bound by Efg1 (Fig. 1D). In contrast, AAF1, ALS7, and ECM331 were regulated by Efg1 in some strains and not in others (Fig. 3B; see also Table S1, differential expression). The 5\u2032 regions of these genes were also uniformly bound by Efg1 (Fig. 1E). Therefore, differences in Efg1-responsive expression of genes cannot be explained by differences in Efg1-promoter region binding.\n\nStrain-limited promoter response to Efg1.\nTo determine whether strain differences in Efg1-responsive gene expression reflect sequence differences in promoter or regulatory regions, we focused on the CHT2 gene. Its RNA levels were repressed by Efg1 in strain SC5314 but activated slightly by Efg1 in strain P75010 (see Table S1, differential expression). To assay activity of the same promoter sequence in both strains, we fused a 1,743-bp fragment from the SC5314 CHT2 5\u2032 region to a lacZ reporter gene and introduced the construct into each wild type (WT) and its derived efg1\u0394/\u0394 mutant (Fig. 4A and B). Measurement of \u03b2-galactosidase indicated that the reporter gene was repressed by Efg1 in strain SC5314 and unaffected by Efg1 in strain P75010 (Fig. 4C). These assays were conducted after hyphal induction for 24\u2009h in RPMI+FBS at 37\u00b0C, allowing time for \u03b2-galactosidase to accumulate. Repression required the CHT2 promoter region (Fig. 4C). These results showed that identical C. albicans promoter sequences respond differently to Efg1 in these two strain backgrounds.\n\nSculpting of Efg1 transcriptional target space by partner TFs.\nTo explore the basis for strain variation in Efg1-responsive gene expression, we focused on the two strains SC5314 and P75010. SC5314 is the type strain for C. albicans and was isolated from a patient with a generalized Candida infection (http://www.candidagenome.org/Strains.shtml). P75010 is a bloodstream isolate (14). We hypothesized that differences in expression or activity of TFs that are functionally related to Efg1 may explain natural variation in the Efg1 regulatory response (Fig. 5A). TF genes that were expressed at higher levels in SC5314 than in P75010 (Fig. 5B; see also Table S2) included WOR1 (regulator of white-opaque switching), ZFU2 (regulator of cell adherence), ADR1 (regulator of carbon metabolism), and TEC1 and BRG1 (regulators of biofilm and hyphal formation). We increased dosages of individual TF genes in P75010 to test whether their increased expression altered Efg1-responsive gene expression.\nEach TF gene, PCR-amplified from strain P75010, was integrated into the genome in P75010 EFG1+/+ and efg1\u0394/\u0394 strains. Integration was targeted to the MDR1 locus. (An mdr1\u0394/\u0394 mutation lacking an inserted TF gene did not alter gene regulation in our assays [Fig. 5C, P75010+empty; see also Table S3, ectopic strains efg1 versus EFG1.]) Gene expression was assayed after hyphal induction for 4\u2009h in RPMI+FBS at 37\u00b0C (Fig. 5C; see also Table S3). Dosage increases yielded 2- to 10-fold increased TF gene expression (see Table S3, WOR1-BRG1-TEC1 relationship). Increased dosage of the known biofilm and hyphal regulatory gene BRG1 in strain P75010 caused Efg1-responsive regulation of ECM331, HGT1, ECE1, and HYR1 to resemble more closely that in strain SC5314. Increased dosage of the biofilm and hyphal regulatory gene TEC1 had similar effects on ECE1 and HYR1. Increased dosage of ZFU2 and ADR1 had little effect (see Table S3, ADR1-ZFU2 data). Increased dosage of WOR1 in P75010 also caused Efg1-responsive regulation to resemble that in SC5314 (Fig. 5C; see also Table S3, ectopic strains efg1 versus EFG1). For example, ECM331 and HYR1 were under negative control by Efg1 in P75010 but under positive control in SC5314 and the increased-dosage strain, P75010+WOR1. Conversely, CHT2 was under positive control by Efg1 in P75010 but under negative control in SC5314 and P75010+WOR1. Although the range of genes assayed was limited, increased dosage of WOR1, BRG1, or TEC1 in strain P75010 caused features of Efg1-dependent gene regulation to resemble those in strain SC5314.\nTo determine whether the gene expression effects of increased TF gene dosage depend upon Efg1, we compared gene dosage impact in P75010 EFG1+/+ and efg1\u0394/\u0394 backgrounds (Fig. 6; see also Table S3, ectopic strains versus empty). Increased BRG1 dosage had significant effects on 10 genes (adjusted P\u2009<\u20090.05; excluding BRG1 itself) in the EFG1+/+ background, and those effects were abolished in the efg1\u0394/\u0394 background. Therefore, effects of increased BRG1 dosage on these genes depend upon Efg1. Increased TEC1 dosage had significant effects on 15 genes (excluding TEC1) in an EFG1+/+ background, and only some of those effects were abolished in an efg1\u0394/\u0394 background. Therefore, effects of increased TEC1 dosage are partially independent of Efg1. Increased WOR1 dosage had significant effects on 10 genes (excluding WOR1) in the EFG1+/+ background, and those effects were abolished in the efg1\u0394/\u0394 background. Therefore, effects of increased WOR1 dosage on these genes depend upon Efg1.\n\nPositive control of biofilm formation by Wor1 in P75010.\nWe hypothesized that the gene expression impact of increased WOR1, BRG1, or TEC1 dosage may translate into biological phenotype. Strain SC5314 is a stronger biofilm former than P75010 (13). We observed that increased dosage of WOR1, BRG1, or TEC1 in P75010 drove greater biofilm production (Fig. 7A), based upon either depth or volume (Fig. 7C). We concluded that differences in WOR1, BRG1, or TEC1 expression levels between strains can account for differences in both biofilm formation ability and Efg1-responsive gene expression.\nThe Efg1-Wor1 physical interaction in vitro depends upon the Wor1 PrLD, a region that is required for Wor1 function in the white-opaque switch (10). We hypothesized that the Efg1-Wor1 functional interaction in gene expression and biofilm formation may also be PrLD dependent. In our increased dosage assay, PrLD-disrupted WOR1 mutants (DE-to-A or YF-to-S) had much less impact than wild-type WOR1 in Efg1-responsive regulation of ECM331, HGT1, ECE1, CHT2, or HYR1 (Fig. 5D; see also Table S3, ectopic strains efg1 versus EFG1) or biofilm production (Fig. 7B and C). Therefore, integrity of the Wor1 PrLD is required for Wor1 to impact both Efg1-responsive gene expression and biofilm formation.\nIf Wor1 promotes biofilm formation through interaction with Efg1, then an efg1\u0394/\u0394 mutation should abrogate the stimulation of biofilm formation by increased WOR1 dosage. We observed that an efg1\u0394/\u0394 mutation blocked biofilm formation in strain P75010 regardless of increased WOR1 dosage (see Fig. S1). Therefore, the impact of WOR1 dosage on biofilm formation, like its impact on Efg1-responsive gene expression, depends upon Efg1.\nIn order to understand the scope of the impact of WOR1 gene expression, we conducted RNA-seq analysis on P75010+empty vector and P75010+WOR1 strains. Increased WOR1 dosage altered expression of 396 genes (293 upregulated, 103 downregulated; fold change, >2; adjusted P < 0.05 [see Data Set S3]). Upregulated genes were enriched for adhesion functions and included many genes associated with biofilm or hyphal growth (ALS1, HYR1, SAP4-SAP5-SAP6, and UME6). The 396 genes with significantly altered expression were enriched for Efg1-bound genes (P\u2009<\u200910\u22125, Fisher\u2019s exact test [see Fig. S1]). EFG1 RNA levels were not significantly affected (see Data Set S3). Therefore, increased WOR1 dosage has a narrow effect on gene expression under these growth conditions. Based on WOR1 dosage effects on gene expression and biofilm formation, our findings support the model that Wor1 acts in part through Efg1 to modulate gene expression."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The study investigates the promoter region binding of Efg1 in diverse C. albicans clinical isolates and examines the variation in the Efg1-responsive transcriptome among these isolates. Through RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analysis, the researchers identified 200 core Efg1-responsive genes as well as 1,051 strain-limited Efg1-responsive genes, indicating natural variation in the Efg1 regulatory circuit. The results suggest that Efg1-target binding is mostly uniform among the five C. albicans isolates. \n\nFurthermore, the study revealed that Efg1 directly regulates 110 genes across all five clinical isolates, with these core direct targets related to adhesion and biofilm formation. The researchers also investigated strain differences in Efg1-responsive gene expression, focusing on strains SC5314 and P75010. The results demonstrated that higher expression levels of WOR1, BRG1, or TEC1 in P75010 correlated with stronger biofilm formation compared to SC5314. Interestingly, the integrity of the Wor1 PrLD was found to be crucial for Wor1 to influence both the Efg1-responsive gene expression and biofilm formation. Thus, Wor1 seems to act in part through Efg1 to modulate gene expression."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Here is the discussion to the same study, give me 3-5 sentences in the same style summarizing it, and then give me another 2-4 sentences explaining the significance of this study and the long term perspective - \n\nIsolates of C. albicans vary for a range of properties connected to biofilm, hyphae, and the regulation of hypha-associated genes. In this report, we sought to determine the basis for natural variation in gene expression responses, with a focus on the well-characterized biofilm and hyphal regulator Efg1. Our findings revealed that the genomic distribution of Efg1 binding regions is essentially uniform among strains, whereas the gene expression impact of bound Efg1 is not. We observed that modest differences in expression of TF genes with some functional connection to Efg1 can have substantial impact on Efg1-responsive gene expression; they can even determine whether genes are under positive or negative Efg1 control. This partner TF analysis revealed that Wor1, a white-opaque regulator known to antagonize Efg1 in cell type switching and commensalism, has an unexpected positive role in biofilm formation. The positive role depends upon determinants of the Wor1 PrLD, which has been shown to mediate Efg1-Wor1 interactions in vitro and in heterologous cells. It is possible that a PrLD-dependent Efg1-Wor1 interaction also functions in biofilm formation (Fig. 8).\nEfg1 core direct target genes.\nA group of 110 genes have 5\u2032 regions bound by Efg1 and expression levels that are up- or downregulated by an efg1\u0394/\u0394 mutation in all five strains examined. Most of these genes are under positive control by Efg1. This group (see Table S1, core direct Efg1 targets) includes well-characterized determinants of biofilm or hypha formation, such as ALS1, ALS3, HGC1, HWP1, and XOG1. The uniform regulatory response of these genes aligns well with the uniform biofilm and hyphal defect for efg1\u0394/\u0394 mutants among these strains (13). In addition, two Efg1 core direct targets specify the biofilm and hyphal transcriptional regulators Brg1 and Ume6. Thus, the previously described Efg1-Brg1-Ume6 feed-forward loop is preserved among multiple strains, in support of its functional significance (3, 4, 15). Efg1 core direct target genes also include several central metabolic genes, such as ADH1, GLK1, HGT6, and PCK1. The products of these genes may help balance competing carbon demands from biofilm matrix synthesis and from energy production and small-molecule synthesis. Still, most of the Efg1 core direct targets lack known or easily rationalized roles in biofilm or hypha formation. This limitation in our understanding may reflect functional redundancy (2, 3, 16\u201322) or perhaps the limited range of biofilm-related phenotypes that have been assayed in mutant analyses.\nEfg1 strain-limited direct target genes.\nEach strain had ~100 to 200 genes whose 5\u2032 regions were bound by Efg1 in all strains but displayed Efg1-responsive expression in only a subset of strains (see Table S1, direct repressed genes and direct activated genes). Strain-limited regulatory responses might be enriched for \u201cnoisy\u201d genes (23); we tried to minimize this concern by using data from six biological replicates of WT and efg1\u0394/\u0394 derivatives of each strain. We calculate that 51 to 62% of strain-limited direct targets have a variance in reads per kilobase per million values below the mean for our complete RNA-seq data set, compared to 31 to 58% of core direct targets (see Data Set S1, variance summary). Therefore, strain-limited direct targets do not show greater day-to-day variation than core direct targets.\nMany strain-limited genes had expression changes that trended in the same direction in all strains but failed to meet our criteria for fold change or statistical significance in one strain. The Efg1-bound genes SFL2, TYE7, and YWP1 are examples. Several of these genes impact biofilm and hyphal formation, thus illustrating that strain-limited bound genes may contribute to the efg1\u0394/\u0394 mutant phenotype. Even the strain-limited bound genes that showed significant expression changes in only one strain background included some with biofilm- and hypha-related functions, such as AHR1, CLN3, and ROB1. Their expression differences may have contributed to the efg1\u0394/\u0394 mutant phenotype in the respective strains as well. However, enrichment for biofilm and hyphal functions is much greater among core direct targets than among strain-limited direct targets.\nOne class of strain-limited direct targets was activated by Efg1 in some strains and repressed by Efg1 in others (see Table S1, differential expression). Sugar transporter genes HGT1, HGT2, and HGT13 were members of this group, as were ferric reductase-like genes CFL4 and CFL5 and the chitinase gene CHT2. In the case of CHT2, our fusion gene analysis (Fig. 4) showed that the Efg1 impact on promoter activity was strain dependent. The existence of such divergent regulatory responses among strains suggests that the net impact of 5\u2032 region-bound Efg1 depends upon the presence of neighboring TFs.\nWor1 function in the Efg1 regulatory circuit.\nWhat are the determinants of strain-limited regulatory responses? TFs that share target genes with Efg1 are candidates that may modulate activity of 5\u2032 region-bound Efg1. This idea led us to look among TF genes whose RNA levels differed between two strains, SC5314 and P75010. Two candidate TF genes specify known regulators of biofilm- and hypha-related gene expression, Brg1 and Tec1. Increased dosage of BRG1 in strain P75010, to mimic the naturally elevated BRG1 expression of SC5314, caused Efg1-responsive regulation of ECM331, HGT1, ECE1, and HYR1 resembling more closely that in strain SC5314. Increased dosage of TEC1 had a similar though less pronounced effect. Increased dosage of BRG1 or TEC1 also had a functional impact, leading to increased biofilm formation by P75010. Given the many interconnections in the biofilm and hypha regulatory network (24), it seems reasonable that increased expression of known biofilm and hyphal regulators would affect Efg1-target relationships.\nThis strategy also pointed to an unexpected connection between Wor1 and biofilm and hyphal gene expression. WOR1 was also expressed at higher levels in SC5314 than in P75010, and increased WOR1 dosage in P75010 caused SC5314-like phenotypes, including increased biofilm formation and features of Efg1-responsive gene regulation. Wor1 mutant derivatives lacking PrLD integrity, which are known to be defective in interaction with Efg1 (10), as well as an efg1\u0394/\u0394 mutation, blocked WOR1 effects on Efg1-responsive gene expression and biofilm formation. These lines of evidence together argue that Wor1 acts in conjunction with Efg1 under biofilm and hyphal growth conditions.\nThe findings presented here broaden our view of the relationship between Wor1 and Efg1 (Fig. 8). White-opaque and white-GUT cell type switching reflect antagonism between Efg1 and Wor1 (1, 5\u20137, 9). The white state is at one extreme, in which Efg1 expression and function predominate; the opaque or GUT state is at the other extreme, in which Wor1 expression and function predominate (1, 5\u20137, 9). However, our analysis of natural variation indicated that a more delicate balance between Wor1 and Efg1 activities had an impact on the capacity to form biofilm and the regulation of Efg1 target genes. The impact of WOR1 in this context supports a new feature of Wor1 function: that Wor1 acts in collaboration with Efg1 in the biofilm and hyphal regulatory network.\nWhat is the nature of the Wor1-Efg1 collaboration? What mechanism enables Wor1 levels to affect Efg1-responsive gene expression? One model is that Wor1 interacts directly with Efg1 to modify its activity. Most Efg1 direct targets are upregulated in P75010+WOR1 compared to P75010+empty vector, suggesting that a hypothetical Wor1-Efg1 complex may have greater activation ability than Efg1 alone. A second model is that Wor1 acts more indirectly to promote expression or activity of known biofilm and hyphal activators that share targets with Efg1. The best candidates from our data are Brg1 and to a lesser extent Tec1, based on the parallels in dosage effects. Specifically, increased dosage of BRG1, TEC1, or WOR1 affected an overlapping set of genes (Fig. 6) and increased biofilm formation (Fig. 7A) in strain P75010. BRG1 and TEC1 RNA levels were elevated ~1.5-fold in P75010+WOR1 compared to P75010+empty vector, increases that make this model seem possible if perhaps not persuasive. The mechanism through which Efg1 and Wor1 act to promote biofilm and hyphal gene expression and biofilm formation remains uncertain at this time.\nNatural variation-driven functional discovery.\nOur findings here emphasize the value of natural strain variation for functional genetic analysis in C. albicans. Natural variation has been exploited previously to define mechanisms of drug resistance (25, 26), genome evolution (27), and virulence determinants (28). However, the lack of a complete sexual cycle precludes genome-wide association studies and related mapping approaches, and the high level of sequence variation among strains makes candidate genes too numerous to explore efficiently. The type strain SC5314 has been a reliable starting point to define genetic determinants of diverse biological processes with reverse-genetics manipulations. However, the features that make it an excellent workhorse, such as strong biofilm formation and a high level of virulence in diverse infection models, may reflect genetic adaptations that amplify activities of some circuits and minimize the impacts of others. Other clinical isolates, with a different selection of amplified and minimized circuits, offer a sensitive context to reveal new gene functions and functional relationships."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The researchers explored the basis for natural variation in gene expression responses among C. albicans isolates, focusing on the biofilm and hyphal regulator Efg1.

Lambda phage and E.coli LE392 have been used to study these interactions. The primary goal was to determine the viral titer and gain insights into the dynamics of virus \u2013 host interactions. \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe viral samples can be enumerated by plaque assay. Viruses are dependent on host cells for their growth. Some viruses lyse the cells in which they replicate. A plaque assay enumerates viruses that lyse their host cells (Libre texts, 2021). In this assay, the hosts and virus are incubated together to allow the virus to attach and enter the host. This mixture is plated in a semi-solid agar. This semi-solid agar is poured onto a bottom agar that serves nutrients to the host cell. The plates are incubated for 24 hours and checked for plaques. \u201cThe plates containing an immediate number of viruses will have plaques, clear or partially clear circular areas in a turbid background of cellular growth.\u201d (Libre texts, section 6.6, 2021) Each plaque is a representative of one virus known as plaque forming unit or PFU. In the experiment, bacterial viruses have been used referred to as phage, Lambda phage. The host cell is E. coli LE392. In this experiment, crystal violet, a dye that stains dead cells, is used to aid in plaque visualization. Crystal violet staining can help enhance the contrast between the clear plaques and the surrounding cellular growth, making it easier to count and quantify the plaques (Libretexts, 2021). \n\nMethodology \n\nThe performers have utilized E. coli LE392 culture and \n\u03bb \n??\n \n \nphage sample. The bacterial culture was prepared overnight by technicians in 0.5% (w/v) yeast-extract enriched LB with 20% maltose and 10mM MgSO4. The phage stock was the plate lysate phage sample that was prepared in the first half of the semester. 10 petri plates containing bottom agar, 10 tubes containing 5mL molten top agar, 10mL \n\u03bb \n??\n \n \nbroth supplemented with 1:1 mixture of 20% maltose and 1M MgSO4 were used for the project. 2mL aliquots of 20% maltose and 1M MgSO4 were provided in the lab. Eppendorf tubes, P10, P100 and P1000 micropipette and tips were used throughout the experimental steps.   \n\nSome steps and values in the protocol were changed for the efficiency of the experiment. The changes are explained as following: \n\nMedia Preparation: \n\nMedia was prepared following the protocol (Rabeneck, 2023, https://learn.senecacollege.ca/ultra/courses/_684187_1/cl/outline ). \n\nThe above protocol was used to prepare 300mL \n\u03bb \n??\n \n \nbroth agar and 70mL \n\u03bb \n??\n \n \ntop agar. \n\nPlate lysate \n\nThe lysate was prepared previously. The protocol (Rabeneck, 2023, https://learn.senecacollege.ca/ultra/courses/_684187_1/cl/outline ) was followed. \n\nE.coli LE392 overnight stock provided. 4mL worth pellet collected, each 1mL centrifuged at 8000rpm \u00d7 2 mins. \n\nThe Pellet resuspended in 0.5mL yeast extract \u2013 enriched LB broth supplemented with 20% maltose and 10mM MgSO4. \n\n0.1mL of resuspended culture transferred to 4 new Eppendorf tubes and 25\u00b5L phage stock added into each tube. \n\nIncubation and plating as per page 2 of the protocol. \n\nFor Step 9, 2mL suspension media was added to each plate for 3X to scrape off the top agar, and 0.15mL chloroform was added at 2% (v/v) concentration to the final volume of 7.5mL. \n\nPlate lysate tube balanced by a water sample weighing 24.1170g and 24.1168g for centrifugation in Step 12 of the protocol. \n\nPlaque Assay \n\nFollow the plaque assay for plate lysate (Rabeneck, 2023, https://learn.senecacollege.ca/ultra/courses/_684187_1/cl/outline ). \n\nThe concentration of the plate lysate phage stock was at \n1.5\u00d71010pfumL\n1\n.\n5\n\u00d7\n10\n10\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n \n. \n\nThe goal in the assay was to get 200 and 100 pfu. A diluting scheme was proposed to achieve the same from the stock. The scheme is explained in the table below. \n\n1:1 mixture of maltose and MgSO4 was prepared. This mixture was prepared by adding 700\u00b5L of 20% maltose to 700\u00b5L 1M MgSO4. \n\nHK performed the dilutions and JP plated the dilutions. \n\nThe last two dilutions were plated. To achieve accuracy, the dilutions were plated in triplicates and then averaged at the end. \n\nThe dilutions were performed in yeast extract \u2013 enriched LB broth supplemented by 20% maltose and 1M MgSO4. \n\n0.1mL of viral stock dilutions 4 and 5 were each taken and transferred to new Eppendorf tubes. This step was performed in replicates to achieve titer accuracy. 0.3mL of bacterial culture was added to each of the tubes followed by their incubation as mentioned in protocol step 8 and 9, page 3.  \n\nThe controls for the experiment were made in duplicates and incubated with the sample tubes. Positive control tube contained 0.3mL culture with 10\u00b5L plate lysate stock. Negative control contained 0.3mL bacterial culture with 0.1mL supplemented LB broth. \n\nPost-incubation, the contents from each tube were added to each of the tubes containing 5mL molten top agar. To all the tubes, 0.1mL of 1:1 mixture of 20% maltose and 1M MgSO4 was added successively. \n\nThe mixture was vortexed and poured onto the \n\u03bb \n??\n \n \nagar plates. The plates were incubated for 24 hours in a 37oC incubator. \n\nApply the above-mentioned numerical values in the referenced protocol.

Dilution 4 and 5 were plated in triplicates. Controls were prepared.

Crystal violet staining was incorporated in the experiment to enhance plaque visualization and improve the accuracy of plaque counting.\n\nThe experiment followed a detailed methodology with some variations in the protocol, like the dilution scheme and staining procedure. A total of 10 petri plates were used in the plaque assay, including controls. Dilutions 4 and 5 were selected for the assay, as they targeted 200 and 100 PFU, respectively, and were plated in triplicates for accuracy.\n\nThe results of the experiment are presented in Tables 2 and 3. The average viral titer before staining was calculated to be 5.8 x 10^9 PFU/mL. After staining with crystal violet, the average viral titer increased to 7.5 x 10^9 PFU/mL. This difference in titer values before and after staining highlights the importance of using a staining procedure, as it enhances the contrast between plaques and the surrounding cellular growth, resulting in more accurate enumeration of viral titers.\n\nComparing the results of Jetul and Harleen's plaque assay from Experiment 1, Jetul obtained a higher average viral titer (3.70 x 10^9 PFU/mL) than Harleen (5.75 x 10^8 PFU/mL). This indicates variability in the approach and technique used between the two individuals, emphasizing the importance of replicating experiments and standardizing procedures in order to obtain accurate and consistent results.\n\nIn conclusion, the plaque assay experiment successfully quantified the virus-host interactions between Lambda phage and E.coli LE392 and determined the viral titer of the samples. Crystal violet staining proved to be beneficial for enhancing plaque visualization, resulting in more accurate and reliable results.

Please make it as long and as detailed as possible"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Introduction to Computational Drug Repurposing:\n\nComputational drug repurposing, also known as drug repositioning, is an innovative process that seeks to find new therapeutic applications for existing drugs. Rather than focusing on the traditional de novo drug discovery approach, which is typically expensive and time-consuming, drug repurposing aims to streamline the process by identifying novel indications for previously approved drugs or drug candidates that have undergone extensive preclinical and clinical testing, are proven to be safe at their effective dosages, and may be optimized for the new indication. Thus, computational drug repurposing provides a promising avenue for accelerating the drug development process and potentially reducing the overall costs and risks associated with it.\n\nGenerally, computational drug repurposing takes advantage of state-of-the-art computational methods, such as machine learning, systems biology, data mining, network analysis, and molecular modeling, to analyze drug-target interactions, disease-gene associations, and other relevant omics (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.) data to identify potential drug-disease connections. These computational approaches help bridge the gap in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying drug action and disease development, allowing researchers to uncover new therapeutic opportunities that may not be apparent from traditional experimental approaches.\n\nCurrent State of the Art:\n\nIn recent years, several computational drug repurposing approaches have been developed and successfully applied in the discovery of novel drug-disease relationships. Some notable examples include:\n\n1. Network-based approaches: Network-based approaches, such as network proximity and network similarity analyses, are employed to explore the relationships between various biological entities, like proteins, genes, and drugs. In a recent study by Guney et al. (Bioinformatics, 2016), it has been demonstrated that drugs targeting proteins that are topologically close to the disease-associated genes in the human protein-protein interaction network are more likely to exhibit therapeutic effects. The authors developed a computational framework called dSysMap that integrates 3D structural information with the network-based analysis, enabling the identification of novel drug targets and repurposing opportunities.\n\n2. Machine learning-based models: Machine learning techniques, including deep learning, support vector machines, and random forest algorithms, have been greatly applied in drug repurposing studies. In a study conducted by Luo et al. (Nature Communications, 2017), they developed a deep learning-based model called DeepDTIs that predicted drug-target interactions with superior accuracy compared to other existing methods. The authors utilized their model to identify new therapeutic opportunities for existing drugs in various therapeutic areas, including anti-cancer, anti-viral, and anti-parasitic agents.\n\n3. Transcriptomics-based signatures: Transcriptomics data can be used to characterize drug-induced and disease-associated gene expression signatures, which can then be compared to identify potential repurposing opportunities. Lamb et al. (Science, 2006) developed a computational method called the Connectivity Map (CMap) that connected small molecules, genes, and disease states using gene expression profiles. The CMap approach has been successfully used to identify novel therapeutic candidates for a variety of diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders and various types of cancer.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe field of computational drug repurposing is constantly evolving, and recent advances in computational techniques and the availability of large-scale omics data have significantly accelerated the discovery of novel drug-disease connections. The adoption of multidisciplinary approaches that integrate various data sources (such as genomics, proteomics, and phenotypic data) and advanced computational algorithms is essential for the successful identification of potential drug repurposing candidates. Furthermore, the integration of computational and experimental methods is critical for the experimental validation of computational predictions and the ultimate translation of these findings into clinically viable therapeutics."}]}, {"facetValue": "design a drug repurposing pipeline that focuses on using graph embedding methods and integrated data including chemical, omics, and electronic health records.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "design a drug repurposing pipeline that focuses on using graph embedding methods for input to a neural network and incorporating integrated data such as chemical data, omics, and electronic health records."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "design a drug repurposing pipeline that focuses on using graph embedding methods and integrated data including chemical, omics, and electronic health records."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "Based on the paper Deep learning for drug repurposing Methods, databases, and applications - Xiaoqin Pan, can you design a drug repurposing pipeline for me?

Gather omics data for target proteins or diseases, including gene expression, protein-protein interactions (PPI), pathways, and phenotypes. This can be obtained from databases such as GEO, STRING, KEGG, and BioGRID.\n\nc. Retrieve Electronic Health Records (EHR) of patients with relevant conditions. This data can provide demographic, clinical, and outcome information for further analysis. Be sure to anonymize and preprocess the data according to privacy regulations.\n\n2. Graph Representation and Embedding\n\na. Represent the collected data as heterogeneous graphs, where nodes can be drugs, target proteins, or diseases, and edges can represent relationships like drug-target interactions or protein-protein interactions.\n\nb. Design a graph embedding method to convert these heterogeneous graphs into continuous vector representations, which can be used as input for your neural network. You can adopt existing graph embedding algorithms like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), GraphSAGE, or Graph Attention Networks (GAT), or propose a novel method tailored for your specific problem.\n\n3. Integrated Data Analysis\n\na. Incorporate the integrated data (chemical data, omics, EHR) as features or additional input channels for your neural network. These can be used to improve the prediction accuracy and the interpretability of your model.\n\nb. Design an appropriate neural network architecture for your task. Drug repurposing can be framed as a binary classification task, a multi-label classification task, or even a ranking problem, depending on your research question.\n\n4. Model Training, Validation, and Evaluation\n\na. Split your data into training, validation, and test sets. Train your neural network using the training set and fine-tune its performance using the validation set.\n\nb. Evaluate your model's performance on the test set using relevant metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC).\n\n5. Drug Repurposing Candidate Identification and Experimental Validation\n\na. Apply your trained model to identify potential drug repurposing candidates. Analyze the predictions and prioritize the most promising candidates.\n\nb. Collaborate with experimental researchers to validate the top candidates through in vitro or in vivo experimental assays.\n\nThis pipeline should serve as a starting point for your research project. You may need to adjust specific steps and methods according to your specific research context and desired outcomes.

The FastDigest HindIII (thermo\nscientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp)\nutilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically\ncompetent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product\nwill be plated on Ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto\nstreptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property.\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior\nto ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however,\nthroughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be\nthoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the\nmistakes.\nMethods/Materials\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid\npUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET\ngenomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)\nrespectively.\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\nGenomic material A260/A280 A260/A230 DNA Conc.

The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 \u00b5L for both DNA. Elution\nbuffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on\nSimpliNano.\nPart B write up 2\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion\nbut BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI\nwill show same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E.coli as it was the case with K12\nstrain.\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with thermos\nscientific FastDigest BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the\nreagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\nDigestion Reagents pUC19 Top10 (rspL gene)\nGenetic material 2 \u00b5L 10 \u00b5L\nFast digest buffer 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme) 1 \u00b5L 1 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade Water 30 \u00b5L 22 \u00b5L\nTotal Reaction volume 35 \u00b5L 35 \u00b5L\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic\nmaterials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were\nincubated in 37 \u00b0C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 \u00b0C for 10 minutes.\nGel electrophoresis to verify digestion from band sizes:\nThis gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion\nwas successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To\nprepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg BIOTECHNOLOGY GRADE Agarose ITM powder\n(Lot : 19H2056197) in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM (0008-090501.52) for\nvisualization.\n1Kb DNA ladder RTU (Froggo-BIO, BIO-HELIX LOT 14007210104) was used as a standard with\nThermo Scientific 6X loading dye (LOT 00799325). 10 \u00b5L of digested genomic was loaded into\nthe gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light(Midi Blue LED\nTransilluminator), there were no bands visible.\nDNA clean-up:\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab\ninstructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using \u201cThermo Scientific GeneJET Gel\nExtraction and DNA clean up kit\u201d the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was\nintroduced in original clean up protocol which stated \u201c10 \u00b5L of Elution buffer\u201d to elute which\nPart B write up 3\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nwas updated to \u201c15 \u00b5L of Elution Buffer\u201d. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on\nSimpliNano after clean up which indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\nCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\nA260/A230 0.826\nA260/A280 1.609\nng/ \u00b5L 12\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after\nclean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306).\nVolume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 \u00b5L and the blank used was the elution\nbuffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided\nby lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which\nwas then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15 \u00b5L elution\nbuffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table\nbelow.\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\nBefore clean up After clean up\nA260/A280 1.598 1.794\nA260/A230 1.143 2.188\nng/ \u00b5L 28.1 109.6\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA\nprovided by Vanessa.

Volume of\nsample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 \u00b5L and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT\n01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\nNew Digestion reaction set up with cleaned up genomic DNA:\nThe new digestion was performed using the cleaned up genomic DNA with higher\nconcentration. The table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\nTable 5: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material.\npUC19 Top10 genomic DNA\nConcentration 17.2 ng/ \u00b5L 109.6 ng/ \u00b5L\nGenomic material 4 \u00b5L 5 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Buffer 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nPart B write up 4\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI) 1 \u00b5L 1 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade water 28 \u00b5L 27 \u00b5L\nTotal reaction volume 35 \u00b5L 35 \u00b5L\nThe table gives the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both\ngenetic materials used in this project to construct a genomic library. Both reactions were\nincubated for half an hour in 37 \u00b0C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 \u00b0C for 10 minutes.\nThe digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was\nready.\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared using same supplies however since the\nconcentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 \u00b5L of cut and uncut\ngenomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded.\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut\ngenomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by\nMahan\u2019s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first\nvisualized under UV light (Midi Blue LED Transilluminator) and then under BIOrad software\nwhich will be added in result section.\nLigation with only one reaction:\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the\nfollowing week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic\ntop10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000.\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\nReaction reagents Ligation ratio (1:1)\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA) 3 \u00b5L\nVector (digested pUC19) 3 \u00b5L\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X) 5 \u00b5L\nT4 Ligase 2 \u00b5L\nPEG4000 2 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade water 10 \u00b5L\nTotal reaction volume 25 \u00b5L\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction\nenzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was\nincubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 \u00b0C for 10 minutes. The\nligated product was then stored at -20 \u00b0C until transformation.\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\nPart B write up 5\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To\nproceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 \u00b5L each) were provided by Vanessa\nalong with 4 agar plates.\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one\nexperimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent\ncells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\nTable 7: Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\nReaction Positive control Negative control Experimental\nReagents 50 \u00b5L competent\ncells + 10 \u00b5L pUC19\n50 \u00b5L of competent\ncells\n50\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at\n42 \u00b0C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered.\nMeanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread\nwith 100 \u00b5L of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 \u00b5L of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 \u00b5L of 500 mM IPTG per\nplate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was\nintroduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 \u00b5L\nonto plates, 150 \u00b5L was plated for each to increase the concentration.\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 \u00b0 C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from\nincubator the next day (March 25, 2023).\nThe results of transformation depicted signs of contamination and no white colonies were\npresent. On the assumption that contamination might have masked the ligation results.\nNew transformation using same ligated product:\nThe following week (March 28, 2023), the same ligated product was used for transformation\nusing same supplies as in previous section. No ligation control was set up as there was not\nenough ligated product left. Following exact same procedure the transformation was\ncompleted and plates were incubated at 35 \u0366 C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from\nincubator the next day (March 29, 2023).\nThe results suggested no success since no white colony was visible.\nDigesting with BamHI and HindIII :\nIn the final week (April 4, 2023) of this project, a new digestion reaction was set up using two\nrestriction enzymes that is FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) and FastDigest BamHI (thermo\nscientific).\nThe reaction reagents and volumes used are listed in the table given below\nPart B write up 6\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nTable 9: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material using\ntwo enzymes.\npUC19 Top10 genomic DNA\nConcentration 17.2 ng/ \u00b5L 109.6 ng/ \u00b5L\nGenomic material 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Buffer 1 \u00b5L 1 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI) 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Enzyme (HindIII) 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade water 3 \u00b5L 3 \u00b5L\nTotal reaction volume 10 \u00b5L 10 \u00b5L\nThe table enlists the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both\ngenetic materials with thermos scientific FastDigest BamHI and HindIII. Both digestion reactions\nwere incubated for half an hour in 37 \u00b0C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 \u00b0C for 10\nminutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis\napparatus was ready.\nGel electrophoresis to verify digestion of genomic material using 2 restriction enzymes:\nWhile performing the digestion reactions one team member was setting up the 1% agarose gel\npreparation. To do so, 500 mg BIOTECHNOLOGY GRADE Agarose ITM powder (Lot : 19H2056197)\nwas used in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer. 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM (0008-090501.52) was added to the\nmixture once cool enough.\n1Kb DNA ladder RTU (Froggo-BIO, BIO-HELIX LOT 14007210104) was used as standard.\nAbout 10 \u00b5L of the sample with 2 \u00b5L loading dye was used to load digested genomic top10 ,\ndigested genomic , undigested pUC19 plasmid , digested plasmid were loaded along with the\nstandard using Thermo Scientific 6X loading dye (LOT 00799325). Once the set up was ready\nand the 30 minutes incubation was complete, the 1% gel electrophoresis was performed was 20\nminutes at 120V. On completion the gel was visualized under UV light (Midi Blue LED\nTransilluminator).\nThe gel results were not up to mark but since there was no time to carry out any other\nprocedures this project came to an end.\nResults\nPart B write up 7\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene\nafter digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE\nbuffer with 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for\n1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 \u00b5L loaded as standard whilst the well\nlabelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 \u00b5L digested sample + 2 \u00b5L loading dye). The\nabove gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded\nwhich was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low\nconcentration of genomic DNA.\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM requires at minimum 50 ng/ \u00b5L of the sample\nconcentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was\nunsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was\nalready quite low with 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume\nof 35 \u00b5L we used 10 \u00b5L of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not\nonly this when we loaded 10 \u00b5L digested sample with 2 \u00b5L loading dye it further diluted. As per\nthis, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L which is very less than 50 ng/ \u00b5L as\nper the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\n(33.2 ng / \u00b5L \u00d7 10 \u00b5L in digestion) / (10 \u00b5L while loading) = 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L\n\nPart B write up 8\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nHence, nothing was detected.Furthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10\nwas not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes\nat 120 V under UV light. This is the seconds gel that contained new digestion reaction\ncontaining the genomic DNA after clean up.

These sites give very\nbig fragments that can be seen as smear in image 2.\nThis enzyme cuts at 662 on pUC19 and creates sticky ends. The total size of the plasmid is 2686\nbp. If we incorporate this plasmid inside a host mentioned above, it gives a smear. There are\nalso chances that host could not uptake the DNA containing rspL gene.\nImage 8: Information regarding the total length of the genomic Top 10 DNA and cutting\npositions using HindIII and BamHI enzymes using restriction analyzer.\nThe above image provides information related to the total length of the genomic Top 10 DNA\nthat is 4537 bp. The tool used for this was restriction analyzer. It also shows that BamHI cuts at\n2 different sites on genomic DNA and HindIII cuts at 4130 site on genomic DNA. The cutting\npositions for BamHI are 180 and 2865 and for HindIII is 4130. We used HindIII to make sure that\nour fragment contains rspL gene.\nImage 9: Information regarding the total length of the plasmid DNA using restriction analyzer\nPart B write up 14\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nThe above image provides information related to the pUC19 plasmid DNA that is 2686 bp long.\nThe tool used for this was restriction analyzer. It also shows that BamHI cuts at 662 position on\nplasmid DNA and HindIII cuts at 632 positions. Since we are using two different enzymes, there\nis a better chance that our fragment contains rspL gene.\nDiscussion\nThe primary objective of this project was to create a genomic library using a streptomycinresistant strain of E.coli Top10 (4537 bp) as the genomic DNA, incorporating it into a pUC19\nplasmid (2686 bp) vector (Cirino et al., 2003). The successful construction of this genomic\nlibrary was expected to confer streptomycin resistance to a recipient E.coli strain Mach1\nthrough the functional selection of the rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983). However, throughout the\nexperiment, several challenges were encountered, leading to changes in the experimental\ndesign and troubleshooting of errors.\nAn initial gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of the rspL gene after digestion\nof genomic DNA with BamHI resulted in no visible bands. This was primarily due to the low\nconcentration of the originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA (33.2 ng/\u00b5L), which was further\ndiluted during the digestion reaction and loading of the gel (Inoue et al., 1990). This\nconcentration was below the minimum detection limit required for the INtRON RedSafeTM\nnucleic acid stain to work efficiently (50 ng/\u00b5L). As a consequence, no bands were detected,\nand the experiment had to be repeated with a new and cleaned up genomic DNA sample.\nSubsequent gel electrophoresis performed after digesting the cleaned-up genomic DNA with\nBamHI showed successful digestion of the genomic Top10 DNA, as evidenced by a shorter\nsmear in comparison to the uncut band of the genomic DNA (Sorek et al., 2013). In addition, the\nplasmid pUC19 showed two very faint bands after digestion with BamHI, indicating appropriate\ndigestion of the plasmid as well.\nPart B write up 15\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nA ligation reaction was set up using a 1:1 ratio for cut genomic Top10 DNA (insert) and cut\nplasmid pUC19 (vector) (Chen & Dubnau, 2004). After overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C, the ligated\nproduct was transformed into Mach1 chemically competent cells. The initial transformation\nresults were inconclusive due to contamination observed in the positive control plate.\nMoreover, the second transformation attempt resulted in an unsuccessful transformation due\nto inefficient uptake of DNA by the host organism, which might have been caused by several\nfactors, such as improper preparation of competent cells, issues concerning the ligation\nreaction, or the transformation protocol itself (Inoue et al., 1990).\nTo increase the likelihood of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene, a third gel\nelectrophoresis was performed using HindIII in addition to BamHI for digesting both genomic\nTop10 DNA and plasmid pUC19 (Cirino et al., 2003). The use of two different enzymes would\nincrease the accuracy of the construct and facilitate the incorporation of the desired fragment\ninto the plasmid (Hanahan, 1983).\nBased on the information provided by the restriction analyzer, the BamHI enzyme cuts at two\ndifferent sites on genomic DNA (180 and 2865), producing large fragments that appeared as a\nsmear in the gel electrophoresis images (Sorek et al., 2013). HindIII was introduced to cut at an\nadditional site (4130) on genomic DNA, increasing the likelihood that the fragment containing\nthe rspL gene would be successfully incorporated into the plasmid (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nIn summary, the construction of a genomic library using E.coli Top10 genomic DNA and pUC19\nplasmid DNA encountered several challenges throughout the experiment, including low DNA\nconcentrations, contamination, and inefficient transformation (Inoue et al., 1990). The\nintroduction of the HindIII enzyme in addition to BamHI for restriction digestion was expected\nto increase the probability of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene (Cirino et al., 2003).\nFurthermore, troubleshooting in each area of competent cells preparation, ligation reaction,\nand transformation protocol can assist in identifying and rectifying these challenges, such as reevaluating the insert-to-vector ratio, incubation time, and temperature for the ligation reaction\nor testing and optimizing various transformation conditions (Hanahan, 1983).\nFor this experiment, the most likely problem would be with transformation. It could be\noptimized and modified by making changes mentioned below:\na. Temperature and duration: Confirm that the heat shock conditions (e.g. 42\u00b0C for 30-45\nseconds) are appropriate for your cells (Inoue et al., 1990).\nb. Recovery duration: Allow adequate time (usually 1 hour) for the cells to recover and express\nthe antibiotic resistance marker (Sorek et al., 2013).\nc. Optimal antibiotic concentration: Ensure the appropriate concentration of streptomycin for\nselection is used on the plates. Too high or low of a concentration may result in inadequate\nselection (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nPart B write up 16\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nIn addition to the technical challenges faced during the genomic library construction, human\nerrors could also have contributed to the unsuccessful or inconclusive results. These errors can\noccur in sample handling, reagent preparation, equipment usage, and protocol execution. Such\nerrors may include:\n1. Cross-contamination: During handling of samples, there is potential for cross-contamination\nbetween different DNA samples or between the samples and reagents, leading to undesired\nresults (Inoue et al., 1990).\n2. Reagent preparation: Errors can occur while preparing various reagents such as buffers,\nenzyme solutions, or antibiotics. These could include inaccurate measurement or mixing of\ncomponents, resulting in incorrect concentrations that can affect experimental outcomes\n(Sorek et al., 2013).\n3. Pipetting errors: Inaccurate pipetting can lead to incorrect volumes being dispensed, resulting\nin the incorrect sample or reagent concentration, which affects the outcome of experiments\n(Hanahan, 1983).\n4. Equipment usage: Improper operation, maintenance, or calibration of laboratory equipment\ncan generate unreliable or inconsistent results. For instance, inaccurate temperature settings\nfor incubation or heat shock can affect the transformation efficiency (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nTo minimize human errors, it is essential to maintain good laboratory practices, maintaining\nproper organization of the workspace, labeling samples accurately, and double-checking\nreagent concentrations. Additionally, regularly calibrating and maintaining equipment,\nfollowing established protocols carefully, and incorporating appropriate controls into\nexperiments will help reduce the occurrence of human errors and enhance the overall success\nof the genomic library construction process.\nFuture experiments can investigate alternative restriction enzymes, plasmid vectors, and\ncompetent cell strains to improve the overall success of the genomic library construction\nprocess (Cirino et al., 2003). Moreover, ensuring a suitable recovery time for transformed cells,\nproviding a nutrient-rich medium during recovery, using appropriate plating methods and\nconditions, and including positive and negative controls in each transformation experiment will\naid in enhancing the efficiency of the genomic library construction and subsequent functional\nselection of the streptomycin resistance-conferring rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983).\nConclusion\nPart B write up 17\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nIn conclusion, the construction of a genomic library using E.coli Top10 genomic DNA and pUC19\nplasmid DNA proved to be challenging due to several factors, including low DNA\nconcentrations, contamination, and inefficient transformation. Optimization of the\ntransformation process, selection of alternative restriction enzymes, plasmid vectors, and\ncompetent cell strains could enhance the overall success of the genomic library construction\nand subsequent functional selection of the streptomycin resistance-conferring rspL gene.\nFuture experiments should also emphasize proper controls, recovery conditions, and nutrientrich media to improve the efficiency of this process. \n\nuse the above mentioned information and make me a ppt using the format mentioned below:\n\nDeliverable Marks\nPower Point format of summarized data\n\u2022 Brief background/purpose (3)\n\u2022 Brief experimental set-up with corresponding results (10)\no Clear tables figures and legends\n13\nTroubleshooting and Next Steps\n\u2022 Discussion of results (10)\no Possible reasons of error, possible optimization\n\u2022 Discuss next steps to proceed forward in the experiment (3)\n13\nSupporting References and Citations\n\u2022 Should have at least (3) 3\nPresentation\n\u2022 Shared presentation (3)\n\u2022 Total presentation 10-15min maximum (2)\n5\nIndividual Grade\n\u2022 Speaks clearly and confidently (2)\n\u2022 Knowledgeable (2)\n\u2022 Successfully answer questions asked (2)\n6\nTotal Deliverable Grade 40\nLab Partner Rubric Grade 10\nTotal Presentation Grade 50"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Slide 1: Title Slide\n- Genomic Library Construction using E.coli Top10 and pUC19\n\nSlide 2: Background/Purpose\n- Create a genomic library with E.coli Top10 (streptomycin-resistant strain) as the genomic DNA\n- Incorporate it into pUC19 plasmid vector\n- Confirm the presence of rspL gene (streptomycin resistance)\n\nSlide 3: Experimental Set-up\n- Isolate genomic DNA and plasmid DNA\n- Perform Restriction Enzyme Digestion (BamHI, HindIII)\n- Gel electrophoresis to verify digestion\n- Ligate digested fragments to pUC19 plasmid\n- Transform ligated product into Mach1 competent cells\n\nSlide 4: Results (Gel Electrophoresis)\n- Image 1: First gel electrophoresis - No visible bands\n- Image 2: Second gel electrophoresis - Successful digestion of genomic DNA and plasmid\n- Image 3: BIORAD image - Confirmation of digestion\n\nSlide 5: Results (Ligation and Transformation)\n- Image 4: Transformation plates - First attempt, contamination in positive control\n- Image 5: Transformation plates - Second attempt, unsuccessful transformation\n\nSlide 6: Troubleshooting and Discussion\n- Low DNA concentrations\n- Contamination\n- Inefficient transformation\n\nSlide 7: Next Steps\n- Optimize transformation conditions\n- Investigate alternative restriction enzymes, plasmid vectors, and competent cell strains\n- Ensure suitable recovery time and conditions\n\nSlide 8: Supporting References\n[1] Cirino, P.

The FastDigest HindIII (thermo\nscientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp)\nutilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically\ncompetent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product\nwill be plated on Ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto\nstreptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property.\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior\nto ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however,\nthroughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be\nthoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the\nmistakes.\nMethods/Materials\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid\npUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET\ngenomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)\nrespectively.\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\nGenomic material A260/A280 A260/A230 DNA Conc.

The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 \u00b5L for both DNA. Elution\nbuffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on\nSimpliNano.\nPart B write up 2\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion\nbut BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI\nwill show same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E.coli as it was the case with K12\nstrain.\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with thermos\nscientific FastDigest BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the\nreagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\nDigestion Reagents pUC19 Top10 (rspL gene)\nGenetic material 2 \u00b5L 10 \u00b5L\nFast digest buffer 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme) 1 \u00b5L 1 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade Water 30 \u00b5L 22 \u00b5L\nTotal Reaction volume 35 \u00b5L 35 \u00b5L\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic\nmaterials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were\nincubated in 37 \u00b0C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 \u00b0C for 10 minutes.\nGel electrophoresis to verify digestion from band sizes:\nThis gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion\nwas successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To\nprepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg BIOTECHNOLOGY GRADE Agarose ITM powder\n(Lot : 19H2056197) in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM (0008-090501.52) for\nvisualization.\n1Kb DNA ladder RTU (Froggo-BIO, BIO-HELIX LOT 14007210104) was used as a standard with\nThermo Scientific 6X loading dye (LOT 00799325). 10 \u00b5L of digested genomic was loaded into\nthe gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light(Midi Blue LED\nTransilluminator), there were no bands visible.\nDNA clean-up:\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab\ninstructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using \u201cThermo Scientific GeneJET Gel\nExtraction and DNA clean up kit\u201d the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was\nintroduced in original clean up protocol which stated \u201c10 \u00b5L of Elution buffer\u201d to elute which\nPart B write up 3\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nwas updated to \u201c15 \u00b5L of Elution Buffer\u201d. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on\nSimpliNano after clean up which indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\nCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\nA260/A230 0.826\nA260/A280 1.609\nng/ \u00b5L 12\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after\nclean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306).\nVolume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 \u00b5L and the blank used was the elution\nbuffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided\nby lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which\nwas then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15 \u00b5L elution\nbuffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table\nbelow.\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\nBefore clean up After clean up\nA260/A280 1.598 1.794\nA260/A230 1.143 2.188\nng/ \u00b5L 28.1 109.6\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA\nprovided by Vanessa. These concentrations refer to the DNA before using GeneJET genomic\nDNA purification kit with its corresponding elution buffer as blank. Also after clean up using\nThermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of\nsample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 \u00b5L and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT\n01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\nNew Digestion reaction set up with cleaned up genomic DNA:\nThe new digestion was performed using the cleaned up genomic DNA with higher\nconcentration. The table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\nTable 5: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material.\npUC19 Top10 genomic DNA\nConcentration 17.2 ng/ \u00b5L 109.6 ng/ \u00b5L\nGenomic material 4 \u00b5L 5 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Buffer 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nPart B write up 4\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI) 1 \u00b5L 1 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade water 28 \u00b5L 27 \u00b5L\nTotal reaction volume 35 \u00b5L 35 \u00b5L\nThe table gives the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both\ngenetic materials used in this project to construct a genomic library. Both reactions were\nincubated for half an hour in 37 \u00b0C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 \u00b0C for 10 minutes.\nThe digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was\nready.\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared using same supplies however since the\nconcentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 \u00b5L of cut and uncut\ngenomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded.\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut\ngenomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by\nMahan\u2019s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first\nvisualized under UV light (Midi Blue LED Transilluminator) and then under BIOrad software\nwhich will be added in result section.\nLigation with only one reaction:\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the\nfollowing week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic\ntop10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000.\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\nReaction reagents Ligation ratio (1:1)\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA) 3 \u00b5L\nVector (digested pUC19) 3 \u00b5L\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X) 5 \u00b5L\nT4 Ligase 2 \u00b5L\nPEG4000 2 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade water 10 \u00b5L\nTotal reaction volume 25 \u00b5L\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction\nenzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was\nincubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 \u00b0C for 10 minutes. The\nligated product was then stored at -20 \u00b0C until transformation.\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\nPart B write up 5\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To\nproceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 \u00b5L each) were provided by Vanessa\nalong with 4 agar plates.\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one\nexperimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent\ncells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\nTable 7: Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\nReaction Positive control Negative control Experimental\nReagents 50 \u00b5L competent\ncells + 10 \u00b5L pUC19\n50 \u00b5L of competent\ncells\n50\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at\n42 \u00b0C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered.\nMeanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread\nwith 100 \u00b5L of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 \u00b5L of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 \u00b5L of 500 mM IPTG per\nplate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was\nintroduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 \u00b5L\nonto plates, 150 \u00b5L was plated for each to increase the concentration.\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 \u00b0 C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from\nincubator the next day (March 25, 2023).\nThe results of transformation depicted signs of contamination and no white colonies were\npresent. On the assumption that contamination might have masked the ligation results.\nNew transformation using same ligated product:\nThe following week (March 28, 2023), the same ligated product was used for transformation\nusing same supplies as in previous section. No ligation control was set up as there was not\nenough ligated product left. Following exact same procedure the transformation was\ncompleted and plates were incubated at 35 \u0366 C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from\nincubator the next day (March 29, 2023).\nThe results suggested no success since no white colony was visible.\nDigesting with BamHI and HindIII :\nIn the final week (April 4, 2023) of this project, a new digestion reaction was set up using two\nrestriction enzymes that is FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) and FastDigest BamHI (thermo\nscientific).\nThe reaction reagents and volumes used are listed in the table given below\nPart B write up 6\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nTable 9: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material using\ntwo enzymes.\npUC19 Top10 genomic DNA\nConcentration 17.2 ng/ \u00b5L 109.6 ng/ \u00b5L\nGenomic material 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Buffer 1 \u00b5L 1 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI) 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Enzyme (HindIII) 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade water 3 \u00b5L 3 \u00b5L\nTotal reaction volume 10 \u00b5L 10 \u00b5L\nThe table enlists the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both\ngenetic materials with thermos scientific FastDigest BamHI and HindIII. Both digestion reactions\nwere incubated for half an hour in 37 \u00b0C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 \u00b0C for 10\nminutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis\napparatus was ready.\nGel electrophoresis to verify digestion of genomic material using 2 restriction enzymes:\nWhile performing the digestion reactions one team member was setting up the 1% agarose gel\npreparation. To do so, 500 mg BIOTECHNOLOGY GRADE Agarose ITM powder (Lot : 19H2056197)\nwas used in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer. 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM (0008-090501.52) was added to the\nmixture once cool enough.\n1Kb DNA ladder RTU (Froggo-BIO, BIO-HELIX LOT 14007210104) was used as standard.\nAbout 10 \u00b5L of the sample with 2 \u00b5L loading dye was used to load digested genomic top10 ,\ndigested genomic , undigested pUC19 plasmid , digested plasmid were loaded along with the\nstandard using Thermo Scientific 6X loading dye (LOT 00799325). Once the set up was ready\nand the 30 minutes incubation was complete, the 1% gel electrophoresis was performed was 20\nminutes at 120V. On completion the gel was visualized under UV light (Midi Blue LED\nTransilluminator).\nThe gel results were not up to mark but since there was no time to carry out any other\nprocedures this project came to an end.\nResults\nPart B write up 7\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene\nafter digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE\nbuffer with 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for\n1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 \u00b5L loaded as standard whilst the well\nlabelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 \u00b5L digested sample + 2 \u00b5L loading dye). The\nabove gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded\nwhich was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low\nconcentration of genomic DNA.\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM requires at minimum 50 ng/ \u00b5L of the sample\nconcentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was\nunsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was\nalready quite low with 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume\nof 35 \u00b5L we used 10 \u00b5L of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not\nonly this when we loaded 10 \u00b5L digested sample with 2 \u00b5L loading dye it further diluted. As per\nthis, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L which is very less than 50 ng/ \u00b5L as\nper the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\n(33.2 ng / \u00b5L \u00d7 10 \u00b5L in digestion) / (10 \u00b5L while loading) = 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L\n\nPart B write up 8\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nHence, nothing was detected.Furthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10\nwas not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes\nat 120 V under UV light. This is the seconds gel that contained new digestion reaction\ncontaining the genomic DNA after clean up.

It also shows that BamHI cuts at 662 position on\nplasmid DNA and HindIII cuts at 632 positions. Since we are using two different enzymes, there\nis a better chance that our fragment contains rspL gene.\nDiscussion\nThe primary objective of this project was to create a genomic library using a streptomycinresistant strain of E.coli Top10 (4537 bp) as the genomic DNA, incorporating it into a pUC19\nplasmid (2686 bp) vector (Cirino et al., 2003). The successful construction of this genomic\nlibrary was expected to confer streptomycin resistance to a recipient E.coli strain Mach1\nthrough the functional selection of the rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983). However, throughout the\nexperiment, several challenges were encountered, leading to changes in the experimental\ndesign and troubleshooting of errors.\nAn initial gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of the rspL gene after digestion\nof genomic DNA with BamHI resulted in no visible bands. This was primarily due to the low\nconcentration of the originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA (33.2 ng/\u00b5L), which was further\ndiluted during the digestion reaction and loading of the gel (Inoue et al., 1990). This\nconcentration was below the minimum detection limit required for the INtRON RedSafeTM\nnucleic acid stain to work efficiently (50 ng/\u00b5L). As a consequence, no bands were detected,\nand the experiment had to be repeated with a new and cleaned up genomic DNA sample.\nSubsequent gel electrophoresis performed after digesting the cleaned-up genomic DNA with\nBamHI showed successful digestion of the genomic Top10 DNA, as evidenced by a shorter\nsmear in comparison to the uncut band of the genomic DNA (Sorek et al., 2013). In addition, the\nplasmid pUC19 showed two very faint bands after digestion with BamHI, indicating appropriate\ndigestion of the plasmid as well.\nPart B write up 15\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nA ligation reaction was set up using a 1:1 ratio for cut genomic Top10 DNA (insert) and cut\nplasmid pUC19 (vector) (Chen & Dubnau, 2004). After overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C, the ligated\nproduct was transformed into Mach1 chemically competent cells. The initial transformation\nresults were inconclusive due to contamination observed in the positive control plate.\nMoreover, the second transformation attempt resulted in an unsuccessful transformation due\nto inefficient uptake of DNA by the host organism, which might have been caused by several\nfactors, such as improper preparation of competent cells, issues concerning the ligation\nreaction, or the transformation protocol itself (Inoue et al., 1990).\nTo increase the likelihood of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene, a third gel\nelectrophoresis was performed using HindIII in addition to BamHI for digesting both genomic\nTop10 DNA and plasmid pUC19 (Cirino et al., 2003). The use of two different enzymes would\nincrease the accuracy of the construct and facilitate the incorporation of the desired fragment\ninto the plasmid (Hanahan, 1983).\nBased on the information provided by the restriction analyzer, the BamHI enzyme cuts at two\ndifferent sites on genomic DNA (180 and 2865), producing large fragments that appeared as a\nsmear in the gel electrophoresis images (Sorek et al., 2013). HindIII was introduced to cut at an\nadditional site (4130) on genomic DNA, increasing the likelihood that the fragment containing\nthe rspL gene would be successfully incorporated into the plasmid (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nIn summary, the construction of a genomic library using E.coli Top10 genomic DNA and pUC19\nplasmid DNA encountered several challenges throughout the experiment, including low DNA\nconcentrations, contamination, and inefficient transformation (Inoue et al., 1990). The\nintroduction of the HindIII enzyme in addition to BamHI for restriction digestion was expected\nto increase the probability of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene (Cirino et al., 2003).\nFurthermore, troubleshooting in each area of competent cells preparation, ligation reaction,\nand transformation protocol can assist in identifying and rectifying these challenges, such as reevaluating the insert-to-vector ratio, incubation time, and temperature for the ligation reaction\nor testing and optimizing various transformation conditions (Hanahan, 1983).\nFor this experiment, the most likely problem would be with transformation. It could be\noptimized and modified by making changes mentioned below:\na. Temperature and duration: Confirm that the heat shock conditions (e.g. 42\u00b0C for 30-45\nseconds) are appropriate for your cells (Inoue et al., 1990).\nb. Recovery duration: Allow adequate time (usually 1 hour) for the cells to recover and express\nthe antibiotic resistance marker (Sorek et al., 2013).\nc. Optimal antibiotic concentration: Ensure the appropriate concentration of streptomycin for\nselection is used on the plates. Too high or low of a concentration may result in inadequate\nselection (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nPart B write up 16\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nIn addition to the technical challenges faced during the genomic library construction, human\nerrors could also have contributed to the unsuccessful or inconclusive results. These errors can\noccur in sample handling, reagent preparation, equipment usage, and protocol execution. Such\nerrors may include:\n1. Cross-contamination: During handling of samples, there is potential for cross-contamination\nbetween different DNA samples or between the samples and reagents, leading to undesired\nresults (Inoue et al., 1990).\n2. Reagent preparation: Errors can occur while preparing various reagents such as buffers,\nenzyme solutions, or antibiotics. These could include inaccurate measurement or mixing of\ncomponents, resulting in incorrect concentrations that can affect experimental outcomes\n(Sorek et al., 2013).\n3. Pipetting errors: Inaccurate pipetting can lead to incorrect volumes being dispensed, resulting\nin the incorrect sample or reagent concentration, which affects the outcome of experiments\n(Hanahan, 1983).\n4. Equipment usage: Improper operation, maintenance, or calibration of laboratory equipment\ncan generate unreliable or inconsistent results. For instance, inaccurate temperature settings\nfor incubation or heat shock can affect the transformation efficiency (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nTo minimize human errors, it is essential to maintain good laboratory practices, maintaining\nproper organization of the workspace, labeling samples accurately, and double-checking\nreagent concentrations. Additionally, regularly calibrating and maintaining equipment,\nfollowing established protocols carefully, and incorporating appropriate controls into\nexperiments will help reduce the occurrence of human errors and enhance the overall success\nof the genomic library construction process.\nFuture experiments can investigate alternative restriction enzymes, plasmid vectors, and\ncompetent cell strains to improve the overall success of the genomic library construction\nprocess (Cirino et al., 2003). Moreover, ensuring a suitable recovery time for transformed cells,\nproviding a nutrient-rich medium during recovery, using appropriate plating methods and\nconditions, and including positive and negative controls in each transformation experiment will\naid in enhancing the efficiency of the genomic library construction and subsequent functional\nselection of the streptomycin resistance-conferring rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983).\nConclusion\nPart B write up 17\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nIn conclusion, the construction of a genomic library using E.coli Top10 genomic DNA and pUC19\nplasmid DNA proved to be challenging due to several factors, including low DNA\nconcentrations, contamination, and inefficient transformation.

The FastDigest HindIII (thermo\nscientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp)\nutilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically\ncompetent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product\nwill be plated on Ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto\nstreptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property.\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior\nto ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however,\nthroughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be\nthoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the\nmistakes.\nMethods/Materials\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid\npUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET\ngenomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)\nrespectively.\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\nGenomic material A260/A280 A260/A230 DNA Conc. (ng/\u00b5L)\nTop10 1.988 1.644 33.2\npUC19 1.866 1.211 17.2\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentration data for isolated genomic material on\nFeb 21, 2023. The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 \u00b5L for both DNA. Elution\nbuffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on\nSimpliNano.\nPart B write up 2\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion\nbut BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI\nwill show same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E.coli as it was the case with K12\nstrain.\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with thermos\nscientific FastDigest BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the\nreagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\nDigestion Reagents pUC19 Top10 (rspL gene)\nGenetic material 2 \u00b5L 10 \u00b5L\nFast digest buffer 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme) 1 \u00b5L 1 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade Water 30 \u00b5L 22 \u00b5L\nTotal Reaction volume 35 \u00b5L 35 \u00b5L\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic\nmaterials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were\nincubated in 37 \u00b0C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 \u00b0C for 10 minutes.\nGel electrophoresis to verify digestion from band sizes:\nThis gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion\nwas successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To\nprepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg BIOTECHNOLOGY GRADE Agarose ITM powder\n(Lot : 19H2056197) in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM (0008-090501.52) for\nvisualization.\n1Kb DNA ladder RTU (Froggo-BIO, BIO-HELIX LOT 14007210104) was used as a standard with\nThermo Scientific 6X loading dye (LOT 00799325). 10 \u00b5L of digested genomic was loaded into\nthe gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light(Midi Blue LED\nTransilluminator), there were no bands visible.\nDNA clean-up:\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab\ninstructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using \u201cThermo Scientific GeneJET Gel\nExtraction and DNA clean up kit\u201d the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was\nintroduced in original clean up protocol which stated \u201c10 \u00b5L of Elution buffer\u201d to elute which\nPart B write up 3\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nwas updated to \u201c15 \u00b5L of Elution Buffer\u201d. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on\nSimpliNano after clean up which indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\nCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\nA260/A230 0.826\nA260/A280 1.609\nng/ \u00b5L 12\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after\nclean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306).\nVolume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 \u00b5L and the blank used was the elution\nbuffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided\nby lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which\nwas then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15 \u00b5L elution\nbuffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table\nbelow.\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\nBefore clean up After clean up\nA260/A280 1.598 1.794\nA260/A230 1.143 2.188\nng/ \u00b5L 28.1 109.6\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA\nprovided by Vanessa.

Volume of\nsample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 \u00b5L and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT\n01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\nNew Digestion reaction set up with cleaned up genomic DNA:\nThe new digestion was performed using the cleaned up genomic DNA with higher\nconcentration. The table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\nTable 5: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material.\npUC19 Top10 genomic DNA\nConcentration 17.2 ng/ \u00b5L 109.6 ng/ \u00b5L\nGenomic material 4 \u00b5L 5 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Buffer 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nPart B write up 4\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI) 1 \u00b5L 1 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade water 28 \u00b5L 27 \u00b5L\nTotal reaction volume 35 \u00b5L 35 \u00b5L\nThe table gives the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both\ngenetic materials used in this project to construct a genomic library. Both reactions were\nincubated for half an hour in 37 \u00b0C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 \u00b0C for 10 minutes.\nThe digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was\nready.\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared using same supplies however since the\nconcentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 \u00b5L of cut and uncut\ngenomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded.\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut\ngenomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by\nMahan\u2019s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first\nvisualized under UV light (Midi Blue LED Transilluminator) and then under BIOrad software\nwhich will be added in result section.\nLigation with only one reaction:\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the\nfollowing week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic\ntop10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000.\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\nReaction reagents Ligation ratio (1:1)\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA) 3 \u00b5L\nVector (digested pUC19) 3 \u00b5L\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X) 5 \u00b5L\nT4 Ligase 2 \u00b5L\nPEG4000 2 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade water 10 \u00b5L\nTotal reaction volume 25 \u00b5L\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction\nenzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was\nincubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 \u00b0C for 10 minutes. The\nligated product was then stored at -20 \u00b0C until transformation.\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\nPart B write up 5\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To\nproceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 \u00b5L each) were provided by Vanessa\nalong with 4 agar plates.\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one\nexperimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent\ncells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\nTable 7: Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\nReaction Positive control Negative control Experimental\nReagents 50 \u00b5L competent\ncells + 10 \u00b5L pUC19\n50 \u00b5L of competent\ncells\n50\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at\n42 \u00b0C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered.\nMeanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread\nwith 100 \u00b5L of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 \u00b5L of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 \u00b5L of 500 mM IPTG per\nplate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was\nintroduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 \u00b5L\nonto plates, 150 \u00b5L was plated for each to increase the concentration.\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 \u00b0 C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from\nincubator the next day (March 25, 2023).\nThe results of transformation depicted signs of contamination and no white colonies were\npresent. On the assumption that contamination might have masked the ligation results.\nNew transformation using same ligated product:\nThe following week (March 28, 2023), the same ligated product was used for transformation\nusing same supplies as in previous section. No ligation control was set up as there was not\nenough ligated product left. Following exact same procedure the transformation was\ncompleted and plates were incubated at 35 \u0366 C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from\nincubator the next day (March 29, 2023).\nThe results suggested no success since no white colony was visible.\nDigesting with BamHI and HindIII :\nIn the final week (April 4, 2023) of this project, a new digestion reaction was set up using two\nrestriction enzymes that is FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) and FastDigest BamHI (thermo\nscientific).\nThe reaction reagents and volumes used are listed in the table given below\nPart B write up 6\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nTable 9: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material using\ntwo enzymes.\npUC19 Top10 genomic DNA\nConcentration 17.2 ng/ \u00b5L 109.6 ng/ \u00b5L\nGenomic material 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Buffer 1 \u00b5L 1 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI) 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Enzyme (HindIII) 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade water 3 \u00b5L 3 \u00b5L\nTotal reaction volume 10 \u00b5L 10 \u00b5L\nThe table enlists the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both\ngenetic materials with thermos scientific FastDigest BamHI and HindIII. Both digestion reactions\nwere incubated for half an hour in 37 \u00b0C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 \u00b0C for 10\nminutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis\napparatus was ready.\nGel electrophoresis to verify digestion of genomic material using 2 restriction enzymes:\nWhile performing the digestion reactions one team member was setting up the 1% agarose gel\npreparation. To do so, 500 mg BIOTECHNOLOGY GRADE Agarose ITM powder (Lot : 19H2056197)\nwas used in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer. 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM (0008-090501.52) was added to the\nmixture once cool enough.\n1Kb DNA ladder RTU (Froggo-BIO, BIO-HELIX LOT 14007210104) was used as standard.\nAbout 10 \u00b5L of the sample with 2 \u00b5L loading dye was used to load digested genomic top10 ,\ndigested genomic , undigested pUC19 plasmid , digested plasmid were loaded along with the\nstandard using Thermo Scientific 6X loading dye (LOT 00799325). Once the set up was ready\nand the 30 minutes incubation was complete, the 1% gel electrophoresis was performed was 20\nminutes at 120V. On completion the gel was visualized under UV light (Midi Blue LED\nTransilluminator).\nThe gel results were not up to mark but since there was no time to carry out any other\nprocedures this project came to an end.\nResults\nPart B write up 7\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene\nafter digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE\nbuffer with 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for\n1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 \u00b5L loaded as standard whilst the well\nlabelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 \u00b5L digested sample + 2 \u00b5L loading dye). The\nabove gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded\nwhich was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low\nconcentration of genomic DNA.\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM requires at minimum 50 ng/ \u00b5L of the sample\nconcentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was\nunsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was\nalready quite low with 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume\nof 35 \u00b5L we used 10 \u00b5L of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not\nonly this when we loaded 10 \u00b5L digested sample with 2 \u00b5L loading dye it further diluted. As per\nthis, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L which is very less than 50 ng/ \u00b5L as\nper the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\n(33.2 ng / \u00b5L \u00d7 10 \u00b5L in digestion) / (10 \u00b5L while loading) = 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L\n\nPart B write up 8\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nHence, nothing was detected.Furthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10\nwas not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes\nat 120 V under UV light.

The cutting\npositions for BamHI are 180 and 2865 and for HindIII is 4130. We used HindIII to make sure that\nour fragment contains rspL gene.\nImage 9: Information regarding the total length of the plasmid DNA using restriction analyzer\nPart B write up 14\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nThe above image provides information related to the pUC19 plasmid DNA that is 2686 bp long.\nThe tool used for this was restriction analyzer. It also shows that BamHI cuts at 662 position on\nplasmid DNA and HindIII cuts at 632 positions. Since we are using two different enzymes, there\nis a better chance that our fragment contains rspL gene.\nDiscussion\nThe primary objective of this project was to create a genomic library using a streptomycinresistant strain of E.coli Top10 (4537 bp) as the genomic DNA, incorporating it into a pUC19\nplasmid (2686 bp) vector (Cirino et al., 2003). The successful construction of this genomic\nlibrary was expected to confer streptomycin resistance to a recipient E.coli strain Mach1\nthrough the functional selection of the rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983). However, throughout the\nexperiment, several challenges were encountered, leading to changes in the experimental\ndesign and troubleshooting of errors.\nAn initial gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of the rspL gene after digestion\nof genomic DNA with BamHI resulted in no visible bands. This was primarily due to the low\nconcentration of the originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA (33.2 ng/\u00b5L), which was further\ndiluted during the digestion reaction and loading of the gel (Inoue et al., 1990). This\nconcentration was below the minimum detection limit required for the INtRON RedSafeTM\nnucleic acid stain to work efficiently (50 ng/\u00b5L). As a consequence, no bands were detected,\nand the experiment had to be repeated with a new and cleaned up genomic DNA sample.\nSubsequent gel electrophoresis performed after digesting the cleaned-up genomic DNA with\nBamHI showed successful digestion of the genomic Top10 DNA, as evidenced by a shorter\nsmear in comparison to the uncut band of the genomic DNA (Sorek et al., 2013). In addition, the\nplasmid pUC19 showed two very faint bands after digestion with BamHI, indicating appropriate\ndigestion of the plasmid as well.\nPart B write up 15\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nA ligation reaction was set up using a 1:1 ratio for cut genomic Top10 DNA (insert) and cut\nplasmid pUC19 (vector) (Chen & Dubnau, 2004). After overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C, the ligated\nproduct was transformed into Mach1 chemically competent cells. The initial transformation\nresults were inconclusive due to contamination observed in the positive control plate.\nMoreover, the second transformation attempt resulted in an unsuccessful transformation due\nto inefficient uptake of DNA by the host organism, which might have been caused by several\nfactors, such as improper preparation of competent cells, issues concerning the ligation\nreaction, or the transformation protocol itself (Inoue et al., 1990).\nTo increase the likelihood of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene, a third gel\nelectrophoresis was performed using HindIII in addition to BamHI for digesting both genomic\nTop10 DNA and plasmid pUC19 (Cirino et al., 2003). The use of two different enzymes would\nincrease the accuracy of the construct and facilitate the incorporation of the desired fragment\ninto the plasmid (Hanahan, 1983).\nBased on the information provided by the restriction analyzer, the BamHI enzyme cuts at two\ndifferent sites on genomic DNA (180 and 2865), producing large fragments that appeared as a\nsmear in the gel electrophoresis images (Sorek et al., 2013). HindIII was introduced to cut at an\nadditional site (4130) on genomic DNA, increasing the likelihood that the fragment containing\nthe rspL gene would be successfully incorporated into the plasmid (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nIn summary, the construction of a genomic library using E.coli Top10 genomic DNA and pUC19\nplasmid DNA encountered several challenges throughout the experiment, including low DNA\nconcentrations, contamination, and inefficient transformation (Inoue et al., 1990). The\nintroduction of the HindIII enzyme in addition to BamHI for restriction digestion was expected\nto increase the probability of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene (Cirino et al., 2003).\nFurthermore, troubleshooting in each area of competent cells preparation, ligation reaction,\nand transformation protocol can assist in identifying and rectifying these challenges, such as reevaluating the insert-to-vector ratio, incubation time, and temperature for the ligation reaction\nor testing and optimizing various transformation conditions (Hanahan, 1983).\nFor this experiment, the most likely problem would be with transformation. It could be\noptimized and modified by making changes mentioned below:\na. Temperature and duration: Confirm that the heat shock conditions (e.g. 42\u00b0C for 30-45\nseconds) are appropriate for your cells (Inoue et al., 1990).\nb. Recovery duration: Allow adequate time (usually 1 hour) for the cells to recover and express\nthe antibiotic resistance marker (Sorek et al., 2013).\nc. Optimal antibiotic concentration: Ensure the appropriate concentration of streptomycin for\nselection is used on the plates. Too high or low of a concentration may result in inadequate\nselection (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nPart B write up 16\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nIn addition to the technical challenges faced during the genomic library construction, human\nerrors could also have contributed to the unsuccessful or inconclusive results. These errors can\noccur in sample handling, reagent preparation, equipment usage, and protocol execution. Such\nerrors may include:\n1. Cross-contamination: During handling of samples, there is potential for cross-contamination\nbetween different DNA samples or between the samples and reagents, leading to undesired\nresults (Inoue et al., 1990).\n2. Reagent preparation: Errors can occur while preparing various reagents such as buffers,\nenzyme solutions, or antibiotics. These could include inaccurate measurement or mixing of\ncomponents, resulting in incorrect concentrations that can affect experimental outcomes\n(Sorek et al., 2013).\n3. Pipetting errors: Inaccurate pipetting can lead to incorrect volumes being dispensed, resulting\nin the incorrect sample or reagent concentration, which affects the outcome of experiments\n(Hanahan, 1983).\n4. Equipment usage: Improper operation, maintenance, or calibration of laboratory equipment\ncan generate unreliable or inconsistent results. For instance, inaccurate temperature settings\nfor incubation or heat shock can affect the transformation efficiency (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nTo minimize human errors, it is essential to maintain good laboratory practices, maintaining\nproper organization of the workspace, labeling samples accurately, and double-checking\nreagent concentrations. Additionally, regularly calibrating and maintaining equipment,\nfollowing established protocols carefully, and incorporating appropriate controls into\nexperiments will help reduce the occurrence of human errors and enhance the overall success\nof the genomic library construction process.\nFuture experiments can investigate alternative restriction enzymes, plasmid vectors, and\ncompetent cell strains to improve the overall success of the genomic library construction\nprocess (Cirino et al., 2003). Moreover, ensuring a suitable recovery time for transformed cells,\nproviding a nutrient-rich medium during recovery, using appropriate plating methods and\nconditions, and including positive and negative controls in each transformation experiment will\naid in enhancing the efficiency of the genomic library construction and subsequent functional\nselection of the streptomycin resistance-conferring rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983).\nConclusion\nPart B write up 17\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nIn conclusion, the construction of a genomic library using E.coli Top10 genomic DNA and pUC19\nplasmid DNA proved to be challenging due to several factors, including low DNA\nconcentrations, contamination, and inefficient transformation. Optimization of the\ntransformation process, selection of alternative restriction enzymes, plasmid vectors, and\ncompetent cell strains could enhance the overall success of the genomic library construction\nand subsequent functional selection of the streptomycin resistance-conferring rspL gene.\nFuture experiments should also emphasize proper controls, recovery conditions, and nutrientrich media to improve the efficiency of this process."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Slide 1: Troubleshooting and Next Steps in Genomic Library Construction\n- Hello everyone, today I will be discussing the troubleshooting and next steps in the genomic library construction we have been working on.\n\nSlide 2: Overview\n- Our project involved creating a genomic library using streptomycin-resistant E.coli Top10 as the genomic DNA, to be incorporated into a pUC19 plasmid vector.

The FastDigest HindIII (thermo\nscientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp)\nutilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically\ncompetent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product\nwill be plated on Ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto\nstreptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property.\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior\nto ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however,\nthroughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be\nthoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the\nmistakes.\nMethods/Materials\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid\npUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET\ngenomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)\nrespectively.\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\nGenomic material A260/A280 A260/A230 DNA Conc. (ng/\u00b5L)\nTop10 1.988 1.644 33.2\npUC19 1.866 1.211 17.2\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentration data for isolated genomic material on\nFeb 21, 2023. The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 \u00b5L for both DNA. Elution\nbuffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on\nSimpliNano.\nPart B write up 2\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion\nbut BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI\nwill show same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E.coli as it was the case with K12\nstrain.\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with thermos\nscientific FastDigest BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the\nreagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\nDigestion Reagents pUC19 Top10 (rspL gene)\nGenetic material 2 \u00b5L 10 \u00b5L\nFast digest buffer 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme) 1 \u00b5L 1 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade Water 30 \u00b5L 22 \u00b5L\nTotal Reaction volume 35 \u00b5L 35 \u00b5L\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic\nmaterials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were\nincubated in 37 \u00b0C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 \u00b0C for 10 minutes.\nGel electrophoresis to verify digestion from band sizes:\nThis gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion\nwas successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To\nprepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg BIOTECHNOLOGY GRADE Agarose ITM powder\n(Lot : 19H2056197) in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM (0008-090501.52) for\nvisualization.\n1Kb DNA ladder RTU (Froggo-BIO, BIO-HELIX LOT 14007210104) was used as a standard with\nThermo Scientific 6X loading dye (LOT 00799325). 10 \u00b5L of digested genomic was loaded into\nthe gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light(Midi Blue LED\nTransilluminator), there were no bands visible.\nDNA clean-up:\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab\ninstructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using \u201cThermo Scientific GeneJET Gel\nExtraction and DNA clean up kit\u201d the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was\nintroduced in original clean up protocol which stated \u201c10 \u00b5L of Elution buffer\u201d to elute which\nPart B write up 3\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nwas updated to \u201c15 \u00b5L of Elution Buffer\u201d. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on\nSimpliNano after clean up which indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\nCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\nA260/A230 0.826\nA260/A280 1.609\nng/ \u00b5L 12\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after\nclean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306).\nVolume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 \u00b5L and the blank used was the elution\nbuffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided\nby lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which\nwas then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15 \u00b5L elution\nbuffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table\nbelow.\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\nBefore clean up After clean up\nA260/A280 1.598 1.794\nA260/A230 1.143 2.188\nng/ \u00b5L 28.1 109.6\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA\nprovided by Vanessa. These concentrations refer to the DNA before using GeneJET genomic\nDNA purification kit with its corresponding elution buffer as blank. Also after clean up using\nThermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of\nsample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 \u00b5L and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT\n01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\nNew Digestion reaction set up with cleaned up genomic DNA:\nThe new digestion was performed using the cleaned up genomic DNA with higher\nconcentration. The table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\nTable 5: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material.\npUC19 Top10 genomic DNA\nConcentration 17.2 ng/ \u00b5L 109.6 ng/ \u00b5L\nGenomic material 4 \u00b5L 5 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Buffer 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nPart B write up 4\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI) 1 \u00b5L 1 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade water 28 \u00b5L 27 \u00b5L\nTotal reaction volume 35 \u00b5L 35 \u00b5L\nThe table gives the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both\ngenetic materials used in this project to construct a genomic library. Both reactions were\nincubated for half an hour in 37 \u00b0C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 \u00b0C for 10 minutes.\nThe digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was\nready.\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared using same supplies however since the\nconcentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 \u00b5L of cut and uncut\ngenomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded.\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut\ngenomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by\nMahan\u2019s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first\nvisualized under UV light (Midi Blue LED Transilluminator) and then under BIOrad software\nwhich will be added in result section.\nLigation with only one reaction:\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the\nfollowing week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic\ntop10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000.\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\nReaction reagents Ligation ratio (1:1)\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA) 3 \u00b5L\nVector (digested pUC19) 3 \u00b5L\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X) 5 \u00b5L\nT4 Ligase 2 \u00b5L\nPEG4000 2 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade water 10 \u00b5L\nTotal reaction volume 25 \u00b5L\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction\nenzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was\nincubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 \u00b0C for 10 minutes. The\nligated product was then stored at -20 \u00b0C until transformation.\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\nPart B write up 5\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To\nproceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 \u00b5L each) were provided by Vanessa\nalong with 4 agar plates.\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one\nexperimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent\ncells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\nTable 7: Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\nReaction Positive control Negative control Experimental\nReagents 50 \u00b5L competent\ncells + 10 \u00b5L pUC19\n50 \u00b5L of competent\ncells\n50\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at\n42 \u00b0C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered.\nMeanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread\nwith 100 \u00b5L of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 \u00b5L of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 \u00b5L of 500 mM IPTG per\nplate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was\nintroduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 \u00b5L\nonto plates, 150 \u00b5L was plated for each to increase the concentration.\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 \u00b0 C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from\nincubator the next day (March 25, 2023).\nThe results of transformation depicted signs of contamination and no white colonies were\npresent. On the assumption that contamination might have masked the ligation results.\nNew transformation using same ligated product:\nThe following week (March 28, 2023), the same ligated product was used for transformation\nusing same supplies as in previous section. No ligation control was set up as there was not\nenough ligated product left. Following exact same procedure the transformation was\ncompleted and plates were incubated at 35 \u0366 C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from\nincubator the next day (March 29, 2023).\nThe results suggested no success since no white colony was visible.\nDigesting with BamHI and HindIII :\nIn the final week (April 4, 2023) of this project, a new digestion reaction was set up using two\nrestriction enzymes that is FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) and FastDigest BamHI (thermo\nscientific).\nThe reaction reagents and volumes used are listed in the table given below\nPart B write up 6\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nTable 9: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material using\ntwo enzymes.\npUC19 Top10 genomic DNA\nConcentration 17.2 ng/ \u00b5L 109.6 ng/ \u00b5L\nGenomic material 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Buffer 1 \u00b5L 1 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI) 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Enzyme (HindIII) 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade water 3 \u00b5L 3 \u00b5L\nTotal reaction volume 10 \u00b5L 10 \u00b5L\nThe table enlists the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both\ngenetic materials with thermos scientific FastDigest BamHI and HindIII. Both digestion reactions\nwere incubated for half an hour in 37 \u00b0C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 \u00b0C for 10\nminutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis\napparatus was ready.\nGel electrophoresis to verify digestion of genomic material using 2 restriction enzymes:\nWhile performing the digestion reactions one team member was setting up the 1% agarose gel\npreparation. To do so, 500 mg BIOTECHNOLOGY GRADE Agarose ITM powder (Lot : 19H2056197)\nwas used in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer. 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM (0008-090501.52) was added to the\nmixture once cool enough.\n1Kb DNA ladder RTU (Froggo-BIO, BIO-HELIX LOT 14007210104) was used as standard.\nAbout 10 \u00b5L of the sample with 2 \u00b5L loading dye was used to load digested genomic top10 ,\ndigested genomic , undigested pUC19 plasmid , digested plasmid were loaded along with the\nstandard using Thermo Scientific 6X loading dye (LOT 00799325). Once the set up was ready\nand the 30 minutes incubation was complete, the 1% gel electrophoresis was performed was 20\nminutes at 120V. On completion the gel was visualized under UV light (Midi Blue LED\nTransilluminator).\nThe gel results were not up to mark but since there was no time to carry out any other\nprocedures this project came to an end.\nResults\nPart B write up 7\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene\nafter digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE\nbuffer with 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for\n1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 \u00b5L loaded as standard whilst the well\nlabelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 \u00b5L digested sample + 2 \u00b5L loading dye). The\nabove gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded\nwhich was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low\nconcentration of genomic DNA.\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM requires at minimum 50 ng/ \u00b5L of the sample\nconcentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was\nunsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was\nalready quite low with 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume\nof 35 \u00b5L we used 10 \u00b5L of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not\nonly this when we loaded 10 \u00b5L digested sample with 2 \u00b5L loading dye it further diluted. As per\nthis, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L which is very less than 50 ng/ \u00b5L as\nper the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\n(33.2 ng / \u00b5L \u00d7 10 \u00b5L in digestion) / (10 \u00b5L while loading) = 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L\n\nPart B write up 8\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nHence, nothing was detected.Furthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10\nwas not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes\nat 120 V under UV light. This is the seconds gel that contained new digestion reaction\ncontaining the genomic DNA after clean up.

These sites give very\nbig fragments that can be seen as smear in image 2.\nThis enzyme cuts at 662 on pUC19 and creates sticky ends. The total size of the plasmid is 2686\nbp. If we incorporate this plasmid inside a host mentioned above, it gives a smear. There are\nalso chances that host could not uptake the DNA containing rspL gene.\nImage 8: Information regarding the total length of the genomic Top 10 DNA and cutting\npositions using HindIII and BamHI enzymes using restriction analyzer.\nThe above image provides information related to the total length of the genomic Top 10 DNA\nthat is 4537 bp. The tool used for this was restriction analyzer. It also shows that BamHI cuts at\n2 different sites on genomic DNA and HindIII cuts at 4130 site on genomic DNA. The cutting\npositions for BamHI are 180 and 2865 and for HindIII is 4130. We used HindIII to make sure that\nour fragment contains rspL gene.\nImage 9: Information regarding the total length of the plasmid DNA using restriction analyzer\nPart B write up 14\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nThe above image provides information related to the pUC19 plasmid DNA that is 2686 bp long.\nThe tool used for this was restriction analyzer. It also shows that BamHI cuts at 662 position on\nplasmid DNA and HindIII cuts at 632 positions. Since we are using two different enzymes, there\nis a better chance that our fragment contains rspL gene.\nDiscussion\nThe primary objective of this project was to create a genomic library using a streptomycinresistant strain of E.coli Top10 (4537 bp) as the genomic DNA, incorporating it into a pUC19\nplasmid (2686 bp) vector (Cirino et al., 2003). The successful construction of this genomic\nlibrary was expected to confer streptomycin resistance to a recipient E.coli strain Mach1\nthrough the functional selection of the rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983). However, throughout the\nexperiment, several challenges were encountered, leading to changes in the experimental\ndesign and troubleshooting of errors.\nAn initial gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of the rspL gene after digestion\nof genomic DNA with BamHI resulted in no visible bands. This was primarily due to the low\nconcentration of the originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA (33.2 ng/\u00b5L), which was further\ndiluted during the digestion reaction and loading of the gel (Inoue et al., 1990). This\nconcentration was below the minimum detection limit required for the INtRON RedSafeTM\nnucleic acid stain to work efficiently (50 ng/\u00b5L). As a consequence, no bands were detected,\nand the experiment had to be repeated with a new and cleaned up genomic DNA sample.\nSubsequent gel electrophoresis performed after digesting the cleaned-up genomic DNA with\nBamHI showed successful digestion of the genomic Top10 DNA, as evidenced by a shorter\nsmear in comparison to the uncut band of the genomic DNA (Sorek et al., 2013). In addition, the\nplasmid pUC19 showed two very faint bands after digestion with BamHI, indicating appropriate\ndigestion of the plasmid as well.\nPart B write up 15\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nA ligation reaction was set up using a 1:1 ratio for cut genomic Top10 DNA (insert) and cut\nplasmid pUC19 (vector) (Chen & Dubnau, 2004). After overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C, the ligated\nproduct was transformed into Mach1 chemically competent cells. The initial transformation\nresults were inconclusive due to contamination observed in the positive control plate.\nMoreover, the second transformation attempt resulted in an unsuccessful transformation due\nto inefficient uptake of DNA by the host organism, which might have been caused by several\nfactors, such as improper preparation of competent cells, issues concerning the ligation\nreaction, or the transformation protocol itself (Inoue et al., 1990).\nTo increase the likelihood of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene, a third gel\nelectrophoresis was performed using HindIII in addition to BamHI for digesting both genomic\nTop10 DNA and plasmid pUC19 (Cirino et al., 2003). The use of two different enzymes would\nincrease the accuracy of the construct and facilitate the incorporation of the desired fragment\ninto the plasmid (Hanahan, 1983).\nBased on the information provided by the restriction analyzer, the BamHI enzyme cuts at two\ndifferent sites on genomic DNA (180 and 2865), producing large fragments that appeared as a\nsmear in the gel electrophoresis images (Sorek et al., 2013). HindIII was introduced to cut at an\nadditional site (4130) on genomic DNA, increasing the likelihood that the fragment containing\nthe rspL gene would be successfully incorporated into the plasmid (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nIn summary, the construction of a genomic library using E.coli Top10 genomic DNA and pUC19\nplasmid DNA encountered several challenges throughout the experiment, including low DNA\nconcentrations, contamination, and inefficient transformation (Inoue et al., 1990). The\nintroduction of the HindIII enzyme in addition to BamHI for restriction digestion was expected\nto increase the probability of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene (Cirino et al., 2003).\nFurthermore, troubleshooting in each area of competent cells preparation, ligation reaction,\nand transformation protocol can assist in identifying and rectifying these challenges, such as reevaluating the insert-to-vector ratio, incubation time, and temperature for the ligation reaction\nor testing and optimizing various transformation conditions (Hanahan, 1983).\nFor this experiment, the most likely problem would be with transformation. It could be\noptimized and modified by making changes mentioned below:\na. Temperature and duration: Confirm that the heat shock conditions (e.g. 42\u00b0C for 30-45\nseconds) are appropriate for your cells (Inoue et al., 1990).\nb. Recovery duration: Allow adequate time (usually 1 hour) for the cells to recover and express\nthe antibiotic resistance marker (Sorek et al., 2013).\nc. Optimal antibiotic concentration: Ensure the appropriate concentration of streptomycin for\nselection is used on the plates. Too high or low of a concentration may result in inadequate\nselection (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nPart B write up 16\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nIn addition to the technical challenges faced during the genomic library construction, human\nerrors could also have contributed to the unsuccessful or inconclusive results. These errors can\noccur in sample handling, reagent preparation, equipment usage, and protocol execution. Such\nerrors may include:\n1. Cross-contamination: During handling of samples, there is potential for cross-contamination\nbetween different DNA samples or between the samples and reagents, leading to undesired\nresults (Inoue et al., 1990).\n2. Reagent preparation: Errors can occur while preparing various reagents such as buffers,\nenzyme solutions, or antibiotics. These could include inaccurate measurement or mixing of\ncomponents, resulting in incorrect concentrations that can affect experimental outcomes\n(Sorek et al., 2013).\n3. Pipetting errors: Inaccurate pipetting can lead to incorrect volumes being dispensed, resulting\nin the incorrect sample or reagent concentration, which affects the outcome of experiments\n(Hanahan, 1983).\n4. Equipment usage: Improper operation, maintenance, or calibration of laboratory equipment\ncan generate unreliable or inconsistent results. For instance, inaccurate temperature settings\nfor incubation or heat shock can affect the transformation efficiency (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nTo minimize human errors, it is essential to maintain good laboratory practices, maintaining\nproper organization of the workspace, labeling samples accurately, and double-checking\nreagent concentrations. Additionally, regularly calibrating and maintaining equipment,\nfollowing established protocols carefully, and incorporating appropriate controls into\nexperiments will help reduce the occurrence of human errors and enhance the overall success\nof the genomic library construction process.\nFuture experiments can investigate alternative restriction enzymes, plasmid vectors, and\ncompetent cell strains to improve the overall success of the genomic library construction\nprocess (Cirino et al., 2003). Moreover, ensuring a suitable recovery time for transformed cells,\nproviding a nutrient-rich medium during recovery, using appropriate plating methods and\nconditions, and including positive and negative controls in each transformation experiment will\naid in enhancing the efficiency of the genomic library construction and subsequent functional\nselection of the streptomycin resistance-conferring rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983).\nConclusion\nPart B write up 17\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nIn conclusion, the construction of a genomic library using E.coli Top10 genomic DNA and pUC19\nplasmid DNA proved to be challenging due to several factors, including low DNA\nconcentrations, contamination, and inefficient transformation.

You have to write me a script according to that and you can use the information mentioned below to present:\n\nBackground\nThis portion of the lab section involved creating a genomic library using a streptomycin\nresistant strain of E.coli top10 (4537 bp) as the genomic DNA which will be incorporated into\npuc19 plasmid (2686 bp) vector as proposed earlier in PART B proposal document.\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) will serve as the genomic strain that\nwill be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo\nscientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp)\nutilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically\ncompetent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product\nwill be plated on Ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto\nstreptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property.\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior\nto ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however,\nthroughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be\nthoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the\nmistakes.\nMethods/Materials\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid\npUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET\ngenomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)\nrespectively.\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\nGenomic material A260/A280 A260/A230 DNA Conc. (ng/\u00b5L)\nTop10 1.988 1.644 33.2\npUC19 1.866 1.211 17.2\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentration data for isolated genomic material on\nFeb 21, 2023. The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 \u00b5L for both DNA. Elution\nbuffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on\nSimpliNano.\nPart B write up 2\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion\nbut BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI\nwill show same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E.coli as it was the case with K12\nstrain.\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with thermos\nscientific FastDigest BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the\nreagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\nDigestion Reagents pUC19 Top10 (rspL gene)\nGenetic material 2 \u00b5L 10 \u00b5L\nFast digest buffer 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme) 1 \u00b5L 1 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade Water 30 \u00b5L 22 \u00b5L\nTotal Reaction volume 35 \u00b5L 35 \u00b5L\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic\nmaterials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were\nincubated in 37 \u00b0C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 \u00b0C for 10 minutes.\nGel electrophoresis to verify digestion from band sizes:\nThis gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion\nwas successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To\nprepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg BIOTECHNOLOGY GRADE Agarose ITM powder\n(Lot : 19H2056197) in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM (0008-090501.52) for\nvisualization.\n1Kb DNA ladder RTU (Froggo-BIO, BIO-HELIX LOT 14007210104) was used as a standard with\nThermo Scientific 6X loading dye (LOT 00799325). 10 \u00b5L of digested genomic was loaded into\nthe gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light(Midi Blue LED\nTransilluminator), there were no bands visible.\nDNA clean-up:\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab\ninstructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using \u201cThermo Scientific GeneJET Gel\nExtraction and DNA clean up kit\u201d the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was\nintroduced in original clean up protocol which stated \u201c10 \u00b5L of Elution buffer\u201d to elute which\nPart B write up 3\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nwas updated to \u201c15 \u00b5L of Elution Buffer\u201d. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on\nSimpliNano after clean up which indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\nCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\nA260/A230 0.826\nA260/A280 1.609\nng/ \u00b5L 12\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after\nclean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306).\nVolume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 \u00b5L and the blank used was the elution\nbuffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided\nby lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which\nwas then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15 \u00b5L elution\nbuffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table\nbelow.\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\nBefore clean up After clean up\nA260/A280 1.598 1.794\nA260/A230 1.143 2.188\nng/ \u00b5L 28.1 109.6\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA\nprovided by Vanessa. These concentrations refer to the DNA before using GeneJET genomic\nDNA purification kit with its corresponding elution buffer as blank. Also after clean up using\nThermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of\nsample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 \u00b5L and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT\n01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\nNew Digestion reaction set up with cleaned up genomic DNA:\nThe new digestion was performed using the cleaned up genomic DNA with higher\nconcentration. The table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\nTable 5: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material.\npUC19 Top10 genomic DNA\nConcentration 17.2 ng/ \u00b5L 109.6 ng/ \u00b5L\nGenomic material 4 \u00b5L 5 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Buffer 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nPart B write up 4\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI) 1 \u00b5L 1 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade water 28 \u00b5L 27 \u00b5L\nTotal reaction volume 35 \u00b5L 35 \u00b5L\nThe table gives the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both\ngenetic materials used in this project to construct a genomic library. Both reactions were\nincubated for half an hour in 37 \u00b0C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 \u00b0C for 10 minutes.\nThe digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was\nready.\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared using same supplies however since the\nconcentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 \u00b5L of cut and uncut\ngenomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded.\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut\ngenomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by\nMahan\u2019s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first\nvisualized under UV light (Midi Blue LED Transilluminator) and then under BIOrad software\nwhich will be added in result section.\nLigation with only one reaction:\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the\nfollowing week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic\ntop10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000.\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\nReaction reagents Ligation ratio (1:1)\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA) 3 \u00b5L\nVector (digested pUC19) 3 \u00b5L\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X) 5 \u00b5L\nT4 Ligase 2 \u00b5L\nPEG4000 2 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade water 10 \u00b5L\nTotal reaction volume 25 \u00b5L\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction\nenzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was\nincubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 \u00b0C for 10 minutes. The\nligated product was then stored at -20 \u00b0C until transformation.\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\nPart B write up 5\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To\nproceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 \u00b5L each) were provided by Vanessa\nalong with 4 agar plates.\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one\nexperimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent\ncells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\nTable 7: Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\nReaction Positive control Negative control Experimental\nReagents 50 \u00b5L competent\ncells + 10 \u00b5L pUC19\n50 \u00b5L of competent\ncells\n50\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at\n42 \u00b0C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered.\nMeanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread\nwith 100 \u00b5L of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 \u00b5L of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 \u00b5L of 500 mM IPTG per\nplate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was\nintroduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 \u00b5L\nonto plates, 150 \u00b5L was plated for each to increase the concentration.\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 \u00b0 C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from\nincubator the next day (March 25, 2023).\nThe results of transformation depicted signs of contamination and no white colonies were\npresent. On the assumption that contamination might have masked the ligation results.\nNew transformation using same ligated product:\nThe following week (March 28, 2023), the same ligated product was used for transformation\nusing same supplies as in previous section. No ligation control was set up as there was not\nenough ligated product left. Following exact same procedure the transformation was\ncompleted and plates were incubated at 35 \u0366 C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from\nincubator the next day (March 29, 2023).\nThe results suggested no success since no white colony was visible.\nDigesting with BamHI and HindIII :\nIn the final week (April 4, 2023) of this project, a new digestion reaction was set up using two\nrestriction enzymes that is FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) and FastDigest BamHI (thermo\nscientific).\nThe reaction reagents and volumes used are listed in the table given below\nPart B write up 6\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nTable 9: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material using\ntwo enzymes.\npUC19 Top10 genomic DNA\nConcentration 17.2 ng/ \u00b5L 109.6 ng/ \u00b5L\nGenomic material 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Buffer 1 \u00b5L 1 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI) 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Enzyme (HindIII) 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade water 3 \u00b5L 3 \u00b5L\nTotal reaction volume 10 \u00b5L 10 \u00b5L\nThe table enlists the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both\ngenetic materials with thermos scientific FastDigest BamHI and HindIII. Both digestion reactions\nwere incubated for half an hour in 37 \u00b0C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 \u00b0C for 10\nminutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis\napparatus was ready.\nGel electrophoresis to verify digestion of genomic material using 2 restriction enzymes:\nWhile performing the digestion reactions one team member was setting up the 1% agarose gel\npreparation. To do so, 500 mg BIOTECHNOLOGY GRADE Agarose ITM powder (Lot : 19H2056197)\nwas used in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer. 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM (0008-090501.52) was added to the\nmixture once cool enough.\n1Kb DNA ladder RTU (Froggo-BIO, BIO-HELIX LOT 14007210104) was used as standard.\nAbout 10 \u00b5L of the sample with 2 \u00b5L loading dye was used to load digested genomic top10 ,\ndigested genomic , undigested pUC19 plasmid , digested plasmid were loaded along with the\nstandard using Thermo Scientific 6X loading dye (LOT 00799325). Once the set up was ready\nand the 30 minutes incubation was complete, the 1% gel electrophoresis was performed was 20\nminutes at 120V. On completion the gel was visualized under UV light (Midi Blue LED\nTransilluminator).\nThe gel results were not up to mark but since there was no time to carry out any other\nprocedures this project came to an end.\nResults\nPart B write up 7\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene\nafter digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE\nbuffer with 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for\n1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 \u00b5L loaded as standard whilst the well\nlabelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 \u00b5L digested sample + 2 \u00b5L loading dye). The\nabove gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded\nwhich was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low\nconcentration of genomic DNA.\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM requires at minimum 50 ng/ \u00b5L of the sample\nconcentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was\nunsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was\nalready quite low with 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume\nof 35 \u00b5L we used 10 \u00b5L of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not\nonly this when we loaded 10 \u00b5L digested sample with 2 \u00b5L loading dye it further diluted. As per\nthis, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L which is very less than 50 ng/ \u00b5L as\nper the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\n(33.2 ng / \u00b5L \u00d7 10 \u00b5L in digestion) / (10 \u00b5L while loading) = 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L\n\nPart B write up 8\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nHence, nothing was detected.Furthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10\nwas not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes\nat 120 V under UV light. This is the seconds gel that contained new digestion reaction\ncontaining the genomic DNA after clean up.

It also shows that BamHI cuts at 662 position on\nplasmid DNA and HindIII cuts at 632 positions. Since we are using two different enzymes, there\nis a better chance that our fragment contains rspL gene.\nDiscussion\nThe primary objective of this project was to create a genomic library using a streptomycinresistant strain of E.coli Top10 (4537 bp) as the genomic DNA, incorporating it into a pUC19\nplasmid (2686 bp) vector (Cirino et al., 2003). The successful construction of this genomic\nlibrary was expected to confer streptomycin resistance to a recipient E.coli strain Mach1\nthrough the functional selection of the rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983). However, throughout the\nexperiment, several challenges were encountered, leading to changes in the experimental\ndesign and troubleshooting of errors.\nAn initial gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of the rspL gene after digestion\nof genomic DNA with BamHI resulted in no visible bands. This was primarily due to the low\nconcentration of the originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA (33.2 ng/\u00b5L), which was further\ndiluted during the digestion reaction and loading of the gel (Inoue et al., 1990). This\nconcentration was below the minimum detection limit required for the INtRON RedSafeTM\nnucleic acid stain to work efficiently (50 ng/\u00b5L). As a consequence, no bands were detected,\nand the experiment had to be repeated with a new and cleaned up genomic DNA sample.\nSubsequent gel electrophoresis performed after digesting the cleaned-up genomic DNA with\nBamHI showed successful digestion of the genomic Top10 DNA, as evidenced by a shorter\nsmear in comparison to the uncut band of the genomic DNA (Sorek et al., 2013). In addition, the\nplasmid pUC19 showed two very faint bands after digestion with BamHI, indicating appropriate\ndigestion of the plasmid as well.\nPart B write up 15\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nA ligation reaction was set up using a 1:1 ratio for cut genomic Top10 DNA (insert) and cut\nplasmid pUC19 (vector) (Chen & Dubnau, 2004). After overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C, the ligated\nproduct was transformed into Mach1 chemically competent cells. The initial transformation\nresults were inconclusive due to contamination observed in the positive control plate.\nMoreover, the second transformation attempt resulted in an unsuccessful transformation due\nto inefficient uptake of DNA by the host organism, which might have been caused by several\nfactors, such as improper preparation of competent cells, issues concerning the ligation\nreaction, or the transformation protocol itself (Inoue et al., 1990).\nTo increase the likelihood of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene, a third gel\nelectrophoresis was performed using HindIII in addition to BamHI for digesting both genomic\nTop10 DNA and plasmid pUC19 (Cirino et al., 2003). The use of two different enzymes would\nincrease the accuracy of the construct and facilitate the incorporation of the desired fragment\ninto the plasmid (Hanahan, 1983).\nBased on the information provided by the restriction analyzer, the BamHI enzyme cuts at two\ndifferent sites on genomic DNA (180 and 2865), producing large fragments that appeared as a\nsmear in the gel electrophoresis images (Sorek et al., 2013). HindIII was introduced to cut at an\nadditional site (4130) on genomic DNA, increasing the likelihood that the fragment containing\nthe rspL gene would be successfully incorporated into the plasmid (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nIn summary, the construction of a genomic library using E.coli Top10 genomic DNA and pUC19\nplasmid DNA encountered several challenges throughout the experiment, including low DNA\nconcentrations, contamination, and inefficient transformation (Inoue et al., 1990). The\nintroduction of the HindIII enzyme in addition to BamHI for restriction digestion was expected\nto increase the probability of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene (Cirino et al., 2003).\nFurthermore, troubleshooting in each area of competent cells preparation, ligation reaction,\nand transformation protocol can assist in identifying and rectifying these challenges, such as reevaluating the insert-to-vector ratio, incubation time, and temperature for the ligation reaction\nor testing and optimizing various transformation conditions (Hanahan, 1983).\nFor this experiment, the most likely problem would be with transformation. It could be\noptimized and modified by making changes mentioned below:\na. Temperature and duration: Confirm that the heat shock conditions (e.g. 42\u00b0C for 30-45\nseconds) are appropriate for your cells (Inoue et al., 1990).\nb. Recovery duration: Allow adequate time (usually 1 hour) for the cells to recover and express\nthe antibiotic resistance marker (Sorek et al., 2013).\nc. Optimal antibiotic concentration: Ensure the appropriate concentration of streptomycin for\nselection is used on the plates. Too high or low of a concentration may result in inadequate\nselection (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nPart B write up 16\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nIn addition to the technical challenges faced during the genomic library construction, human\nerrors could also have contributed to the unsuccessful or inconclusive results. These errors can\noccur in sample handling, reagent preparation, equipment usage, and protocol execution. Such\nerrors may include:\n1. Cross-contamination: During handling of samples, there is potential for cross-contamination\nbetween different DNA samples or between the samples and reagents, leading to undesired\nresults (Inoue et al., 1990).\n2. Reagent preparation: Errors can occur while preparing various reagents such as buffers,\nenzyme solutions, or antibiotics. These could include inaccurate measurement or mixing of\ncomponents, resulting in incorrect concentrations that can affect experimental outcomes\n(Sorek et al., 2013).\n3. Pipetting errors: Inaccurate pipetting can lead to incorrect volumes being dispensed, resulting\nin the incorrect sample or reagent concentration, which affects the outcome of experiments\n(Hanahan, 1983).\n4. Equipment usage: Improper operation, maintenance, or calibration of laboratory equipment\ncan generate unreliable or inconsistent results. For instance, inaccurate temperature settings\nfor incubation or heat shock can affect the transformation efficiency (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nTo minimize human errors, it is essential to maintain good laboratory practices, maintaining\nproper organization of the workspace, labeling samples accurately, and double-checking\nreagent concentrations. Additionally, regularly calibrating and maintaining equipment,\nfollowing established protocols carefully, and incorporating appropriate controls into\nexperiments will help reduce the occurrence of human errors and enhance the overall success\nof the genomic library construction process.\nFuture experiments can investigate alternative restriction enzymes, plasmid vectors, and\ncompetent cell strains to improve the overall success of the genomic library construction\nprocess (Cirino et al., 2003). Moreover, ensuring a suitable recovery time for transformed cells,\nproviding a nutrient-rich medium during recovery, using appropriate plating methods and\nconditions, and including positive and negative controls in each transformation experiment will\naid in enhancing the efficiency of the genomic library construction and subsequent functional\nselection of the streptomycin resistance-conferring rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983).\nConclusion\nPart B write up 17\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nIn conclusion, the construction of a genomic library using E.coli Top10 genomic DNA and pUC19\nplasmid DNA proved to be challenging due to several factors, including low DNA\nconcentrations, contamination, and inefficient transformation.

The successful construction of this genomic\nlibrary was expected to confer streptomycin resistance to a recipient E.coli strain Mach1\nthrough the functional selection of the rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983). However, throughout the\nexperiment, several challenges were encountered, leading to changes in the experimental\ndesign and troubleshooting of errors.\nAn initial gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of the rspL gene after digestion\nof genomic DNA with BamHI resulted in no visible bands. This was primarily due to the low\nconcentration of the originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA (33.2 ng/\u00b5L), which was further\ndiluted during the digestion reaction and loading of the gel (Inoue et al., 1990). This\nconcentration was below the minimum detection limit required for the INtRON RedSafeTM\nnucleic acid stain to work efficiently (50 ng/\u00b5L). As a consequence, no bands were detected,\nand the experiment had to be repeated with a new and cleaned up genomic DNA sample.\nSubsequent gel electrophoresis performed after digesting the cleaned-up genomic DNA with\nBamHI showed successful digestion of the genomic Top10 DNA, as evidenced by a shorter\nsmear in comparison to the uncut band of the genomic DNA (Sorek et al., 2013). In addition, the\nplasmid pUC19 showed two very faint bands after digestion with BamHI, indicating appropriate\ndigestion of the plasmid as well.\nPart B write up 15\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nA ligation reaction was set up using a 1:1 ratio for cut genomic Top10 DNA (insert) and cut\nplasmid pUC19 (vector) (Chen & Dubnau, 2004). After overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C, the ligated\nproduct was transformed into Mach1 chemically competent cells. The initial transformation\nresults were inconclusive due to contamination observed in the positive control plate.\nMoreover, the second transformation attempt resulted in an unsuccessful transformation due\nto inefficient uptake of DNA by the host organism, which might have been caused by several\nfactors, such as improper preparation of competent cells, issues concerning the ligation\nreaction, or the transformation protocol itself (Inoue et al., 1990).\nTo increase the likelihood of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene, a third gel\nelectrophoresis was performed using HindIII in addition to BamHI for digesting both genomic\nTop10 DNA and plasmid pUC19 (Cirino et al., 2003). The use of two different enzymes would\nincrease the accuracy of the construct and facilitate the incorporation of the desired fragment\ninto the plasmid (Hanahan, 1983).\nBased on the information provided by the restriction analyzer, the BamHI enzyme cuts at two\ndifferent sites on genomic DNA (180 and 2865), producing large fragments that appeared as a\nsmear in the gel electrophoresis images (Sorek et al., 2013). HindIII was introduced to cut at an\nadditional site (4130) on genomic DNA, increasing the likelihood that the fragment containing\nthe rspL gene would be successfully incorporated into the plasmid (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nIn summary, the construction of a genomic library using E.coli Top10 genomic DNA and pUC19\nplasmid DNA encountered several challenges throughout the experiment, including low DNA\nconcentrations, contamination, and inefficient transformation (Inoue et al., 1990). The\nintroduction of the HindIII enzyme in addition to BamHI for restriction digestion was expected\nto increase the probability of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene (Cirino et al., 2003).\nFurthermore, troubleshooting in each area of competent cells preparation, ligation reaction,\nand transformation protocol can assist in identifying and rectifying these challenges, such as reevaluating the insert-to-vector ratio, incubation time, and temperature for the ligation reaction\nor testing and optimizing various transformation conditions (Hanahan, 1983).\nFor this experiment, the most likely problem would be with transformation. It could be\noptimized and modified by making changes mentioned below:\na. Temperature and duration: Confirm that the heat shock conditions (e.g. 42\u00b0C for 30-45\nseconds) are appropriate for your cells (Inoue et al., 1990).\nb.

The well labelled 1 was utilized for\n1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 \u00b5L loaded as standard whilst the well\nlabelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 \u00b5L digested sample + 2 \u00b5L loading dye). The\nabove gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded\nwhich was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low\nconcentration of genomic DNA.\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM requires at minimum 50 ng/ \u00b5L of the sample\nconcentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was\nunsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was\nalready quite low with 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume\nof 35 \u00b5L we used 10 \u00b5L of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not\nonly this when we loaded 10 \u00b5L digested sample with 2 \u00b5L loading dye it further diluted. As per\nthis, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L which is very less than 50 ng/ \u00b5L as\nper the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\n(33.2 ng / \u00b5L \u00d7 10 \u00b5L in digestion) / (10 \u00b5L while loading) = 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L\n\nPart B write up 8\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nHence, nothing was detected.Furthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10\nwas not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes\nat 120 V under UV light.

These sites give very\nbig fragments that can be seen as smear in image 2.\nThis enzyme cuts at 662 on pUC19 and creates sticky ends. The total size of the plasmid is 2686\nbp. If we incorporate this plasmid inside a host mentioned above, it gives a smear.

The cutting\npositions for BamHI are 180 and 2865 and for HindIII is 4130. We used HindIII to make sure that\nour fragment contains rspL gene.\nImage 9: Information regarding the total length of the plasmid DNA using restriction analyzer\nPart B write up 14\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nThe above image provides information related to the pUC19 plasmid DNA that is 2686 bp long.\nThe tool used for this was restriction analyzer. It also shows that BamHI cuts at 662 position on\nplasmid DNA and HindIII cuts at 632 positions. Since we are using two different enzymes, there\nis a better chance that our fragment contains rspL gene.\nDiscussion\nThe primary objective of this project was to create a genomic library using a streptomycinresistant strain of E.coli Top10 (4537 bp) as the genomic DNA, incorporating it into a pUC19\nplasmid (2686 bp) vector (Cirino et al., 2003). The successful construction of this genomic\nlibrary was expected to confer streptomycin resistance to a recipient E.coli strain Mach1\nthrough the functional selection of the rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983). However, throughout the\nexperiment, several challenges were encountered, leading to changes in the experimental\ndesign and troubleshooting of errors.\nAn initial gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of the rspL gene after digestion\nof genomic DNA with BamHI resulted in no visible bands. This was primarily due to the low\nconcentration of the originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA (33.2 ng/\u00b5L), which was further\ndiluted during the digestion reaction and loading of the gel (Inoue et al., 1990). This\nconcentration was below the minimum detection limit required for the INtRON RedSafeTM\nnucleic acid stain to work efficiently (50 ng/\u00b5L). As a consequence, no bands were detected,\nand the experiment had to be repeated with a new and cleaned up genomic DNA sample.\nSubsequent gel electrophoresis performed after digesting the cleaned-up genomic DNA with\nBamHI showed successful digestion of the genomic Top10 DNA, as evidenced by a shorter\nsmear in comparison to the uncut band of the genomic DNA (Sorek et al., 2013). In addition, the\nplasmid pUC19 showed two very faint bands after digestion with BamHI, indicating appropriate\ndigestion of the plasmid as well.\nPart B write up 15\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nA ligation reaction was set up using a 1:1 ratio for cut genomic Top10 DNA (insert) and cut\nplasmid pUC19 (vector) (Chen & Dubnau, 2004). After overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C, the ligated\nproduct was transformed into Mach1 chemically competent cells. The initial transformation\nresults were inconclusive due to contamination observed in the positive control plate.\nMoreover, the second transformation attempt resulted in an unsuccessful transformation due\nto inefficient uptake of DNA by the host organism, which might have been caused by several\nfactors, such as improper preparation of competent cells, issues concerning the ligation\nreaction, or the transformation protocol itself (Inoue et al., 1990).\nTo increase the likelihood of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene, a third gel\nelectrophoresis was performed using HindIII in addition to BamHI for digesting both genomic\nTop10 DNA and plasmid pUC19 (Cirino et al., 2003). The use of two different enzymes would\nincrease the accuracy of the construct and facilitate the incorporation of the desired fragment\ninto the plasmid (Hanahan, 1983).\nBased on the information provided by the restriction analyzer, the BamHI enzyme cuts at two\ndifferent sites on genomic DNA (180 and 2865), producing large fragments that appeared as a\nsmear in the gel electrophoresis images (Sorek et al., 2013). HindIII was introduced to cut at an\nadditional site (4130) on genomic DNA, increasing the likelihood that the fragment containing\nthe rspL gene would be successfully incorporated into the plasmid (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nIn summary, the construction of a genomic library using E.coli Top10 genomic DNA and pUC19\nplasmid DNA encountered several challenges throughout the experiment, including low DNA\nconcentrations, contamination, and inefficient transformation (Inoue et al., 1990). The\nintroduction of the HindIII enzyme in addition to BamHI for restriction digestion was expected\nto increase the probability of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene (Cirino et al., 2003).\nFurthermore, troubleshooting in each area of competent cells preparation, ligation reaction,\nand transformation protocol can assist in identifying and rectifying these challenges, such as reevaluating the insert-to-vector ratio, incubation time, and temperature for the ligation reaction\nor testing and optimizing various transformation conditions (Hanahan, 1983).\nFor this experiment, the most likely problem would be with transformation. It could be\noptimized and modified by making changes mentioned below:\na. Temperature and duration: Confirm that the heat shock conditions (e.g. 42\u00b0C for 30-45\nseconds) are appropriate for your cells (Inoue et al., 1990).\nb. Recovery duration: Allow adequate time (usually 1 hour) for the cells to recover and express\nthe antibiotic resistance marker (Sorek et al., 2013).\nc. Optimal antibiotic concentration: Ensure the appropriate concentration of streptomycin for\nselection is used on the plates. Too high or low of a concentration may result in inadequate\nselection (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nPart B write up 16\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nIn addition to the technical challenges faced during the genomic library construction, human\nerrors could also have contributed to the unsuccessful or inconclusive results. These errors can\noccur in sample handling, reagent preparation, equipment usage, and protocol execution. Such\nerrors may include:\n1. Cross-contamination: During handling of samples, there is potential for cross-contamination\nbetween different DNA samples or between the samples and reagents, leading to undesired\nresults (Inoue et al., 1990).\n2. Reagent preparation: Errors can occur while preparing various reagents such as buffers,\nenzyme solutions, or antibiotics.

However, I can help guide you on how to proceed with your RNA-Seq Project in R.\n\nTo cover each objective, you can follow these general steps:\n\n1. For Quality Check (Objective 1): You can use FastQC (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) to obtain quality reports for your sequencing reads. In R, you can use the 'system' function to run FastQC on your input, like this:\n```\nsystem(\"fastqc inputfile.fastq\")\n```\n\n2. For Mapping (Objective 2): You can use STAR aligner (https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) to map your reads to a reference genome. Then, import the results to Galaxy, where you can explore the mapping statistics using various tools within the platform.\n\n3. For Differential Gene Expression Analysis (Objective 3): In R, install and use the DESeq2 package to perform differential gene expression analysis. Follow the tutorial available here for guidance: https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html\n```\nlibrary(DESeq2)\n```\n\n4. For Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (Objective 4): You can use the ClusterProfiler package in R to perform GSOA and GSEA analysis. Check this tutorial on how to use the package: http://yulab-smu.top/clusterProfiler-book/chapter2.html\n```\nlibrary(clusterProfiler)\n```\n\n5. For generating Enrichment Map (Objective 4): One option is to use the Cytoscape app - EnrichmentMap (http://baderlab.org/Software/EnrichmentMap). Save maps in PDF format.\n\n6. Answering Questions (Objective 5): Based on the analysis outputs, provide detailed answers to the questions provided in the Word document.\n\n7. For R code: Save your R script with appropriate comments and export Galaxy snapshots.\n\nRemember to adjust the parameters and file names in the code as needed for your specific dataset.

As per\nthis, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L which is very less than 50 ng/ \u00b5L as\nper the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\n(33.2 ng / \u00b5L \u00d7 10 \u00b5L in digestion) / (10 \u00b5L while loading) = 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L\n\nPart B write up 8\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nHence, nothing was detected.Furthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10\nwas not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes\nat 120 V under UV light.

It also shows that BamHI cuts at 662 position on\nplasmid DNA and HindIII cuts at 632 positions. Since we are using two different enzymes, there\nis a better chance that our fragment contains rspL gene.\nDiscussion\nThe primary objective of this project was to create a genomic library using a streptomycinresistant strain of E.coli Top10 (4537 bp) as the genomic DNA, incorporating it into a pUC19\nplasmid (2686 bp) vector (Cirino et al., 2003). The successful construction of this genomic\nlibrary was expected to confer streptomycin resistance to a recipient E.coli strain Mach1\nthrough the functional selection of the rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983). However, throughout the\nexperiment, several challenges were encountered, leading to changes in the experimental\ndesign and troubleshooting of errors.\nAn initial gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of the rspL gene after digestion\nof genomic DNA with BamHI resulted in no visible bands. This was primarily due to the low\nconcentration of the originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA (33.2 ng/\u00b5L), which was further\ndiluted during the digestion reaction and loading of the gel (Inoue et al., 1990). This\nconcentration was below the minimum detection limit required for the INtRON RedSafeTM\nnucleic acid stain to work efficiently (50 ng/\u00b5L). As a consequence, no bands were detected,\nand the experiment had to be repeated with a new and cleaned up genomic DNA sample.\nSubsequent gel electrophoresis performed after digesting the cleaned-up genomic DNA with\nBamHI showed successful digestion of the genomic Top10 DNA, as evidenced by a shorter\nsmear in comparison to the uncut band of the genomic DNA (Sorek et al., 2013). In addition, the\nplasmid pUC19 showed two very faint bands after digestion with BamHI, indicating appropriate\ndigestion of the plasmid as well.\nPart B write up 15\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nA ligation reaction was set up using a 1:1 ratio for cut genomic Top10 DNA (insert) and cut\nplasmid pUC19 (vector) (Chen & Dubnau, 2004). After overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C, the ligated\nproduct was transformed into Mach1 chemically competent cells. The initial transformation\nresults were inconclusive due to contamination observed in the positive control plate.\nMoreover, the second transformation attempt resulted in an unsuccessful transformation due\nto inefficient uptake of DNA by the host organism, which might have been caused by several\nfactors, such as improper preparation of competent cells, issues concerning the ligation\nreaction, or the transformation protocol itself (Inoue et al., 1990).\nTo increase the likelihood of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene, a third gel\nelectrophoresis was performed using HindIII in addition to BamHI for digesting both genomic\nTop10 DNA and plasmid pUC19 (Cirino et al., 2003). The use of two different enzymes would\nincrease the accuracy of the construct and facilitate the incorporation of the desired fragment\ninto the plasmid (Hanahan, 1983).\nBased on the information provided by the restriction analyzer, the BamHI enzyme cuts at two\ndifferent sites on genomic DNA (180 and 2865), producing large fragments that appeared as a\nsmear in the gel electrophoresis images (Sorek et al., 2013). HindIII was introduced to cut at an\nadditional site (4130) on genomic DNA, increasing the likelihood that the fragment containing\nthe rspL gene would be successfully incorporated into the plasmid (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nIn summary, the construction of a genomic library using E.coli Top10 genomic DNA and pUC19\nplasmid DNA encountered several challenges throughout the experiment, including low DNA\nconcentrations, contamination, and inefficient transformation (Inoue et al., 1990). The\nintroduction of the HindIII enzyme in addition to BamHI for restriction digestion was expected\nto increase the probability of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene (Cirino et al., 2003).\nFurthermore, troubleshooting in each area of competent cells preparation, ligation reaction,\nand transformation protocol can assist in identifying and rectifying these challenges, such as reevaluating the insert-to-vector ratio, incubation time, and temperature for the ligation reaction\nor testing and optimizing various transformation conditions (Hanahan, 1983).\nFor this experiment, the most likely problem would be with transformation. It could be\noptimized and modified by making changes mentioned below:\na. Temperature and duration: Confirm that the heat shock conditions (e.g. 42\u00b0C for 30-45\nseconds) are appropriate for your cells (Inoue et al., 1990).\nb. Recovery duration: Allow adequate time (usually 1 hour) for the cells to recover and express\nthe antibiotic resistance marker (Sorek et al., 2013).\nc. Optimal antibiotic concentration: Ensure the appropriate concentration of streptomycin for\nselection is used on the plates. Too high or low of a concentration may result in inadequate\nselection (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nPart B write up 16\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nIn addition to the technical challenges faced during the genomic library construction, human\nerrors could also have contributed to the unsuccessful or inconclusive results. These errors can\noccur in sample handling, reagent preparation, equipment usage, and protocol execution. Such\nerrors may include:\n1. Cross-contamination: During handling of samples, there is potential for cross-contamination\nbetween different DNA samples or between the samples and reagents, leading to undesired\nresults (Inoue et al., 1990).\n2. Reagent preparation: Errors can occur while preparing various reagents such as buffers,\nenzyme solutions, or antibiotics. These could include inaccurate measurement or mixing of\ncomponents, resulting in incorrect concentrations that can affect experimental outcomes\n(Sorek et al., 2013).\n3. Pipetting errors: Inaccurate pipetting can lead to incorrect volumes being dispensed, resulting\nin the incorrect sample or reagent concentration, which affects the outcome of experiments\n(Hanahan, 1983).\n4. Equipment usage: Improper operation, maintenance, or calibration of laboratory equipment\ncan generate unreliable or inconsistent results. For instance, inaccurate temperature settings\nfor incubation or heat shock can affect the transformation efficiency (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nTo minimize human errors, it is essential to maintain good laboratory practices, maintaining\nproper organization of the workspace, labeling samples accurately, and double-checking\nreagent concentrations. Additionally, regularly calibrating and maintaining equipment,\nfollowing established protocols carefully, and incorporating appropriate controls into\nexperiments will help reduce the occurrence of human errors and enhance the overall success\nof the genomic library construction process.\nFuture experiments can investigate alternative restriction enzymes, plasmid vectors, and\ncompetent cell strains to improve the overall success of the genomic library construction\nprocess (Cirino et al., 2003). Moreover, ensuring a suitable recovery time for transformed cells,\nproviding a nutrient-rich medium during recovery, using appropriate plating methods and\nconditions, and including positive and negative controls in each transformation experiment will\naid in enhancing the efficiency of the genomic library construction and subsequent functional\nselection of the streptomycin resistance-conferring rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983).\n\n\naccording to the above results and discussion, give me a step by step presentation slides keeping in mind the criteria below:\n\nTroubleshooting and Next Steps\n\u2022 Discussion of results (10)\no Possible reasons of error, possible optimization\n\u2022 Discuss next steps to proceed forward in the experiment (3)\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Slide 1: Title Slide\n- Troubleshooting and Next Steps: Constructing a Genomic Library using E.coli Top10 and pUC19\n\nSlide 2: Key Results\n- Low DNA concentrations\n- Ineffective digestion\n- Contamination issues\n- Inefficient transformation\n\nSlide 3: Troubleshooting - DNA Concentrations\n- Optimize DNA isolation and cleanup protocols\n- Confirm DNA concentrations using spectrophotometry\n- Consider using concentration methods (e.g., ethanol precipitation) to increase DNA yield\n\nSlide 4: Troubleshooting - Digestion\n- Troubleshoot enzyme activity\n- Optimize digestion conditions (e.g., buffer composition, temperature, and incubation time)\n- Confirm the presence of correct restriction sites\n- Explore alternative restriction enzymes\n\nSlide 5: Troubleshooting - Contamination\n- Maintain good laboratory practices\n- Properly sterilize equipment and reagents\n- Incorporate appropriate negative controls to track contamination sources\n\nSlide 6: Troubleshooting - Transformation\n- Optimize competent cell preparation\n- Modify ligation ratio and incubation conditions\n- Re-evaluate heat-shock conditions for maximal transformation efficiency\n\nSlide 7: Next Steps - Restriction Enzymes\n- Investigate alternative restriction enzymes for enhanced digestion efficiency\n- Include additional enzymes, such as HindIII, to increase the likelihood of capturing the rspL gene fragment\n\nSlide 8: Next Steps - Plasmid Vectors and Competent Cell Strains\n- Explore alternative plasmid vectors and competent cell strains for improved transformation success\n\nSlide 9: Next Steps - Recovery and Plating Conditions\n- Ensure a suitable recovery time for transformed cells\n- Provide a nutrient-rich medium during recovery\n- Optimize plating methods and conditions\n- Include positive and negative controls in each transformation experiment\n\nSlide 10: In Conclusion\n- Troubleshooting and optimization are critical for successful genomic library construction\n- Future experiments should focus on refining protocols, analyzing results accurately, and implementing appropriate controls to enhance overall efficiency\n- Continued exploration of alternative enzymes, vectors, and strains will contribute to improved success rates for functional selection of the streptomycin resistance-conferring rspL gene"}]}, {"facetValue": "summarize and present experimental results from a genetic engineering project, including challenges faced during the process.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "create a genomic library using a streptomycin-resistant strain of E.coli Top10 and a pUC19 plasmid, and to address the challenges faced during the process."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "summarize and present experimental results from a genetic engineering project, including challenges faced during the process."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "3"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "Results\nPart B write up 7\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene\nafter digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE\nbuffer with 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye.

The successful construction of this genomic\nlibrary was expected to confer streptomycin resistance to a recipient E.coli strain Mach1\nthrough the functional selection of the rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983). However, throughout the\nexperiment, several challenges were encountered, leading to changes in the experimental\ndesign and troubleshooting of errors.\nAn initial gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of the rspL gene after digestion\nof genomic DNA with BamHI resulted in no visible bands. This was primarily due to the low\nconcentration of the originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA (33.2 ng/\u00b5L), which was further\ndiluted during the digestion reaction and loading of the gel (Inoue et al., 1990). This\nconcentration was below the minimum detection limit required for the INtRON RedSafeTM\nnucleic acid stain to work efficiently (50 ng/\u00b5L). As a consequence, no bands were detected,\nand the experiment had to be repeated with a new and cleaned up genomic DNA sample.\nSubsequent gel electrophoresis performed after digesting the cleaned-up genomic DNA with\nBamHI showed successful digestion of the genomic Top10 DNA, as evidenced by a shorter\nsmear in comparison to the uncut band of the genomic DNA (Sorek et al., 2013). In addition, the\nplasmid pUC19 showed two very faint bands after digestion with BamHI, indicating appropriate\ndigestion of the plasmid as well.\nPart B write up 15\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nA ligation reaction was set up using a 1:1 ratio for cut genomic Top10 DNA (insert) and cut\nplasmid pUC19 (vector) (Chen & Dubnau, 2004). After overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C, the ligated\nproduct was transformed into Mach1 chemically competent cells. The initial transformation\nresults were inconclusive due to contamination observed in the positive control plate.\nMoreover, the second transformation attempt resulted in an unsuccessful transformation due\nto inefficient uptake of DNA by the host organism, which might have been caused by several\nfactors, such as improper preparation of competent cells, issues concerning the ligation\nreaction, or the transformation protocol itself (Inoue et al., 1990).\nTo increase the likelihood of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene, a third gel\nelectrophoresis was performed using HindIII in addition to BamHI for digesting both genomic\nTop10 DNA and plasmid pUC19 (Cirino et al., 2003). The use of two different enzymes would\nincrease the accuracy of the construct and facilitate the incorporation of the desired fragment\ninto the plasmid (Hanahan, 1983).\nBased on the information provided by the restriction analyzer, the BamHI enzyme cuts at two\ndifferent sites on genomic DNA (180 and 2865), producing large fragments that appeared as a\nsmear in the gel electrophoresis images (Sorek et al., 2013). HindIII was introduced to cut at an\nadditional site (4130) on genomic DNA, increasing the likelihood that the fragment containing\nthe rspL gene would be successfully incorporated into the plasmid (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nIn summary, the construction of a genomic library using E.coli Top10 genomic DNA and pUC19\nplasmid DNA encountered several challenges throughout the experiment, including low DNA\nconcentrations, contamination, and inefficient transformation (Inoue et al., 1990). The\nintroduction of the HindIII enzyme in addition to BamHI for restriction digestion was expected\nto increase the probability of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene (Cirino et al., 2003).\nFurthermore, troubleshooting in each area of competent cells preparation, ligation reaction,\nand transformation protocol can assist in identifying and rectifying these challenges, such as reevaluating the insert-to-vector ratio, incubation time, and temperature for the ligation reaction\nor testing and optimizing various transformation conditions (Hanahan, 1983).\nFor this experiment, the most likely problem would be with transformation. It could be\noptimized and modified by making changes mentioned below:\na. Temperature and duration: Confirm that the heat shock conditions (e.g. 42\u00b0C for 30-45\nseconds) are appropriate for your cells (Inoue et al., 1990).\nb. Recovery duration: Allow adequate time (usually 1 hour) for the cells to recover and express\nthe antibiotic resistance marker (Sorek et al., 2013).\nc. Optimal antibiotic concentration: Ensure the appropriate concentration of streptomycin for\nselection is used on the plates. Too high or low of a concentration may result in inadequate\nselection (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nPart B write up 16\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nIn addition to the technical challenges faced during the genomic library construction, human\nerrors could also have contributed to the unsuccessful or inconclusive results. These errors can\noccur in sample handling, reagent preparation, equipment usage, and protocol execution. Such\nerrors may include:\n1. Cross-contamination: During handling of samples, there is potential for cross-contamination\nbetween different DNA samples or between the samples and reagents, leading to undesired\nresults (Inoue et al., 1990).\n2. Reagent preparation: Errors can occur while preparing various reagents such as buffers,\nenzyme solutions, or antibiotics. These could include inaccurate measurement or mixing of\ncomponents, resulting in incorrect concentrations that can affect experimental outcomes\n(Sorek et al., 2013).\n3. Pipetting errors: Inaccurate pipetting can lead to incorrect volumes being dispensed, resulting\nin the incorrect sample or reagent concentration, which affects the outcome of experiments\n(Hanahan, 1983).\n4. Equipment usage: Improper operation, maintenance, or calibration of laboratory equipment\ncan generate unreliable or inconsistent results. For instance, inaccurate temperature settings\nfor incubation or heat shock can affect the transformation efficiency (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nTo minimize human errors, it is essential to maintain good laboratory practices, maintaining\nproper organization of the workspace, labeling samples accurately, and double-checking\nreagent concentrations. Additionally, regularly calibrating and maintaining equipment,\nfollowing established protocols carefully, and incorporating appropriate controls into\nexperiments will help reduce the occurrence of human errors and enhance the overall success\nof the genomic library construction process.\nFuture experiments can investigate alternative restriction enzymes, plasmid vectors, and\ncompetent cell strains to improve the overall success of the genomic library construction\nprocess (Cirino et al., 2003). Moreover, ensuring a suitable recovery time for transformed cells,\nproviding a nutrient-rich medium during recovery, using appropriate plating methods and\nconditions, and including positive and negative controls in each transformation experiment will\naid in enhancing the efficiency of the genomic library construction and subsequent functional\nselection of the streptomycin resistance-conferring rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983).\n\n\naccording to the above results and discussion, give me a step by step presentation slides, no more than 10 slides\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Slide 1: Title\n- Construction of a Genomic Library: Challenges and Future Directions\n\nSlide 2: Objective\n- Create a genomic library using a streptomycin-resistant strain of E.coli Top10\n- Incorporate the rspL gene into a pUC19 plasmid vector\n- Confer streptomycin resistance to recipient E.coli Mach1 strain\n\nSlide 3: Initial Gel Electrophoresis\n- First gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion with BamHI\n- No bands were detected due to low concentration of genomic DNA (33.2 ng/\u00b5L)\n\nSlide 4: Repeated Gel Electrophoresis with Cleaned-up DNA\n- Second gel electrophoresis performed after digesting new genomic DNA with BamHI\n- Successful digestion observed for genomic Top10 DNA and pUC19 plasmid\n\nSlide 5: Ligation and Transformation\n- Ligation reaction set up with 1:1 ratio of cut genomic Top10 DNA and cut pUC19 plasmid\n- Unsuccessful transformation outcomes observed twice (contamination and inefficient uptake of DNA)\n\nSlide 6: Introducing HindIII Enzyme\n- Third gel electrophoresis performed using HindIII enzyme in addition to BamHI \n- Aimed at increasing the probability of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene\n\nSlide 7: Transformation Challenges\n- Possible issues: preparation of competent cells, ligation reaction, and transformation protocol\n- Optimization and troubleshooting strategies:\n  a.

The cutting\npositions for BamHI are 180 and 2865 and for HindIII is 4130. We used HindIII to make sure that\nour fragment contains rspL gene.\nImage 9: Information regarding the total length of the plasmid DNA using restriction analyzer\nPart B write up 14\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nThe above image provides information related to the pUC19 plasmid DNA that is 2686 bp long.\nThe tool used for this was restriction analyzer. It also shows that BamHI cuts at 662 position on\nplasmid DNA and HindIII cuts at 632 positions. Since we are using two different enzymes, there\nis a better chance that our fragment contains rspL gene.\nDiscussion\nThe primary objective of this project was to create a genomic library using a streptomycinresistant strain of E.coli Top10 (4537 bp) as the genomic DNA, incorporating it into a pUC19\nplasmid (2686 bp) vector (Cirino et al., 2003). The successful construction of this genomic\nlibrary was expected to confer streptomycin resistance to a recipient E.coli strain Mach1\nthrough the functional selection of the rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983). However, throughout the\nexperiment, several challenges were encountered, leading to changes in the experimental\ndesign and troubleshooting of errors.\nAn initial gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of the rspL gene after digestion\nof genomic DNA with BamHI resulted in no visible bands. This was primarily due to the low\nconcentration of the originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA (33.2 ng/\u00b5L), which was further\ndiluted during the digestion reaction and loading of the gel (Inoue et al., 1990). This\nconcentration was below the minimum detection limit required for the INtRON RedSafeTM\nnucleic acid stain to work efficiently (50 ng/\u00b5L). As a consequence, no bands were detected,\nand the experiment had to be repeated with a new and cleaned up genomic DNA sample.\nSubsequent gel electrophoresis performed after digesting the cleaned-up genomic DNA with\nBamHI showed successful digestion of the genomic Top10 DNA, as evidenced by a shorter\nsmear in comparison to the uncut band of the genomic DNA (Sorek et al., 2013). In addition, the\nplasmid pUC19 showed two very faint bands after digestion with BamHI, indicating appropriate\ndigestion of the plasmid as well.\nPart B write up 15\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nA ligation reaction was set up using a 1:1 ratio for cut genomic Top10 DNA (insert) and cut\nplasmid pUC19 (vector) (Chen & Dubnau, 2004). After overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C, the ligated\nproduct was transformed into Mach1 chemically competent cells. The initial transformation\nresults were inconclusive due to contamination observed in the positive control plate.\nMoreover, the second transformation attempt resulted in an unsuccessful transformation due\nto inefficient uptake of DNA by the host organism, which might have been caused by several\nfactors, such as improper preparation of competent cells, issues concerning the ligation\nreaction, or the transformation protocol itself (Inoue et al., 1990).\nTo increase the likelihood of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene, a third gel\nelectrophoresis was performed using HindIII in addition to BamHI for digesting both genomic\nTop10 DNA and plasmid pUC19 (Cirino et al., 2003). The use of two different enzymes would\nincrease the accuracy of the construct and facilitate the incorporation of the desired fragment\ninto the plasmid (Hanahan, 1983).\nBased on the information provided by the restriction analyzer, the BamHI enzyme cuts at two\ndifferent sites on genomic DNA (180 and 2865), producing large fragments that appeared as a\nsmear in the gel electrophoresis images (Sorek et al., 2013). HindIII was introduced to cut at an\nadditional site (4130) on genomic DNA, increasing the likelihood that the fragment containing\nthe rspL gene would be successfully incorporated into the plasmid (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nIn summary, the construction of a genomic library using E.coli Top10 genomic DNA and pUC19\nplasmid DNA encountered several challenges throughout the experiment, including low DNA\nconcentrations, contamination, and inefficient transformation (Inoue et al., 1990). The\nintroduction of the HindIII enzyme in addition to BamHI for restriction digestion was expected\nto increase the probability of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene (Cirino et al., 2003).\nFurthermore, troubleshooting in each area of competent cells preparation, ligation reaction,\nand transformation protocol can assist in identifying and rectifying these challenges, such as reevaluating the insert-to-vector ratio, incubation time, and temperature for the ligation reaction\nor testing and optimizing various transformation conditions (Hanahan, 1983).\nFor this experiment, the most likely problem would be with transformation. It could be\noptimized and modified by making changes mentioned below:\na. Temperature and duration: Confirm that the heat shock conditions (e.g. 42\u00b0C for 30-45\nseconds) are appropriate for your cells (Inoue et al., 1990).\nb. Recovery duration: Allow adequate time (usually 1 hour) for the cells to recover and express\nthe antibiotic resistance marker (Sorek et al., 2013).\nc. Optimal antibiotic concentration: Ensure the appropriate concentration of streptomycin for\nselection is used on the plates. Too high or low of a concentration may result in inadequate\nselection (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nPart B write up 16\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nIn addition to the technical challenges faced during the genomic library construction, human\nerrors could also have contributed to the unsuccessful or inconclusive results. These errors can\noccur in sample handling, reagent preparation, equipment usage, and protocol execution. Such\nerrors may include:\n1. Cross-contamination: During handling of samples, there is potential for cross-contamination\nbetween different DNA samples or between the samples and reagents, leading to undesired\nresults (Inoue et al., 1990).\n2. Reagent preparation: Errors can occur while preparing various reagents such as buffers,\nenzyme solutions, or antibiotics. These could include inaccurate measurement or mixing of\ncomponents, resulting in incorrect concentrations that can affect experimental outcomes\n(Sorek et al., 2013).\n3. Pipetting errors: Inaccurate pipetting can lead to incorrect volumes being dispensed, resulting\nin the incorrect sample or reagent concentration, which affects the outcome of experiments\n(Hanahan, 1983).\n4. Equipment usage: Improper operation, maintenance, or calibration of laboratory equipment\ncan generate unreliable or inconsistent results. For instance, inaccurate temperature settings\nfor incubation or heat shock can affect the transformation efficiency (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nTo minimize human errors, it is essential to maintain good laboratory practices, maintaining\nproper organization of the workspace, labeling samples accurately, and double-checking\nreagent concentrations. Additionally, regularly calibrating and maintaining equipment,\nfollowing established protocols carefully, and incorporating appropriate controls into\nexperiments will help reduce the occurrence of human errors and enhance the overall success\nof the genomic library construction process.\nFuture experiments can investigate alternative restriction enzymes, plasmid vectors, and\ncompetent cell strains to improve the overall success of the genomic library construction\nprocess (Cirino et al., 2003). Moreover, ensuring a suitable recovery time for transformed cells,\nproviding a nutrient-rich medium during recovery, using appropriate plating methods and\nconditions, and including positive and negative controls in each transformation experiment will\naid in enhancing the efficiency of the genomic library construction and subsequent functional\nselection of the streptomycin resistance-conferring rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983).\n\n\naccording to the above results and discussion, give me a step by step presentation slides,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Slide 1: Title\n- Construction of a Genomic Library: Challenges and Future Directions\n\nSlide 2: Objective\n- Create a genomic library using a streptomycin-resistant strain of E.coli Top10\n- Incorporate the rspL gene into a pUC19 plasmid vector\n- Confer streptomycin resistance to recipient E.coli Mach1 strain\n\nSlide 3: Initial Gel Electrophoresis\n- First gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene after digestion with BamHI\n- No bands were detected due to low concentration of genomic DNA (33.2 ng/\u00b5L)\n\nSlide 4: Repeated Gel Electrophoresis with Cleaned-up DNA\n-"}]}, {"facetValue": "troubleshoot issues related to gel electrophoresis and DNA digestion in a transformation experiment.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "troubleshoot issues related to gel electrophoresis, specifically why bands are not visible and why there are smears, and to resolve problems in a transformation experiment."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "troubleshoot issues related to gel electrophoresis and DNA digestion in a transformation experiment."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "why my bands on gel electrophoresis are not visible?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There could be several reasons why bands on gel electrophoresis are not visible:\n\n1. Low DNA concentration: If the amount of DNA loaded onto the gel is too low, it may not be sufficient for the bands to be visible. Make sure to load an appropriate amount of DNA and use a DNA ladder or marker to gauge the concentration.\n\n2. Incomplete separation or diffusion of DNA fragments: Poor separation or diffusion of the DNA fragments can also lead to faint or invisible bands. Make sure the voltage and running time are optimized for your gel type and size.\n\n3. Incorrect agarose gel concentration: If the agarose gel concentration is not suitable for your DNA fragment sizes, the bands may not be resolved properly. Adjust the agarose concentration according to the size of the DNA fragments you are analyzing.\n\n4. Ineffective staining: Inadequate staining of the gel could result in faint or invisible bands. Make sure to use the appropriate concentration of DNA stain (e.g., ethidium bromide or SYBR Green) and allow sufficient staining time for optimal visualization.\n\n5. Inefficient DNA transfer to gel: If your DNA samples were not transferred efficiently from the wells to the gel matrix, this could lead to poor visibility of the bands. Ensure proper pipetting technique during sample loading and use a loading dye to monitor the progress of your samples during electrophoresis.\n\n6. Broken DNA or degradation: DNA may not be intact or may have degraded during the extraction or storage process. Ensure that you are using fresh and well-preserved DNA samples.\n\n7. Inadequate exposure during visualization: When visualizing the DNA bands using a gel imager, make sure the exposure settings are optimized for the best signal-to-noise ratio. Adjust the exposure time, gain, or contrast settings for optimal visualization of the bands.\n\n8. Error in the experimental procedure: There could be mistakes or problems with your PCR amplification or other steps of your experiment, leading to no product or very low concentrations of products.\n\nIt's important to troubleshoot the above possibilities in order to identify and resolve the issue with the gel electrophoresis."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what is the possible reason my gel electrophoresis showing smears?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Smearing in gel electrophoresis can be caused by several factors:\n\n1. Overloading the sample: Loading too much DNA or RNA onto the gel can cause smearing due to the inability of the gel to resolve the high concentrations of nucleic acids. To resolve this issue, reduce the amount of sample loaded onto the gel.\n\n2. Degradation of nucleic acids: If the DNA or RNA in your sample has been damaged or degraded, it may appear as a smear on the gel. To avoid this, ensure that samples are handled properly, with appropriate storage conditions and minimal exposure to heat or nucleases.\n\n3. Incomplete digestion of restriction enzyme-treated samples: If your DNA samples have been treated with restriction enzymes, incomplete digestion can result in smearing. To overcome this problem, optimize the digestion reaction conditions (enzyme concentration, temperature, and time) and run a control sample to verify complete digestion.\n\n4. Secondary structures in nucleic acids: Secondary structures (e.g., hairpins) in DNA or RNA can lead to slow and irregular migration patterns, causing smearing. Heating the samples before loading and using chemical denaturants, such as formamide or urea, can help resolve these structures and improve electrophoretic separation.\n\n5. High voltage or incorrect running time: Running the gel electrophoresis at a high voltage or incorrect running time can cause the bands to spread and appear as smears. Optimize the voltage and running time for the gel type, percentage, and size of the nucleic acid fragments being analyzed.\n\n6. Inappropriate agarose gel concentration: An agarose gel concentration that is too low or too high for the sizes of your DNA or RNA fragments may cause smearing. Adjust the agarose concentration according to the size range of your nucleic acid fragments.\n\n7. Contamination with residual phenol or other organic solvents: Impurities, such as residual phenol or other solvents from the nucleic acid extraction process, can cause smearing. Make sure to properly clean and purify your DNA or RNA samples before electrophoresis.\n\n8. Inappropriate buffer composition or old buffer: The composition of the running buffer or the use of a very old buffer can also cause smearing. Check the buffer concentrations and prepare fresh running buffer to ensure proper separation of nucleic acids on the gel.\n\nTroubleshooting the factors mentioned above and optimizing your gel electrophoresis conditions should help in resolving and preventing smearing in your results."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what could be the reason due to failure of digestion in transformation experiment?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Failure of digestion in a transformation experiment could be due to several reasons:\n\n1. Inactive or insufficient enzymes: The restriction enzymes used for digestion might be inactive due to expired shelf life or improper storage conditions. Make sure to use fresh, properly stored enzymes and optimize the amount of enzyme added to the reaction.\n\n2. Inappropriate buffer conditions: The buffer conditions for the restriction enzyme digestion need to be optimal for the specific enzyme being used. Ensure that the correct buffer and the appropriate concentration of buffer components, such as salt concentration and pH, are provided for the enzyme to work efficiently.\n\n3. Suboptimal digestion temperature or time: Different restriction enzymes have different optimal reaction temperatures and incubation times. Make sure to follow the manufacturer's recommendations for the specific enzyme you are using.\n\n4. Incomplete plasmid linearization: If the plasmid DNA is not completely linearized or if multiple binding sites are present for the restriction enzyme, the digestion process might not be effective. Consider using a different restriction enzyme or a combination of enzymes, and check for multiple binding sites in the plasmid sequence.\n\n5. Methylated or modified DNA: Some restriction enzymes are sensitive to DNA methylation or other modifications at their recognition sites, which can prevent digestion. Try using a methylation-insensitive isoschizomer of the restriction enzyme or treating your DNA with a methylation-blocking enzyme, such as Dam or Dcm methylases.\n\n6. Inefficient purification or precipitation of digested fragments: After restriction digestion, the DNA fragments may not be effectively purified or precipitated, leading to poor transformation efficiency. Optimize the purification steps, either by using a column purification method or by improving the ethanol precipitation process.\n\n7. Competing reactions: Some restriction enzymes may exhibit star activity or non-specific digestion under certain conditions, leading to unexpected digestion products or competition for the enzyme. Take care to avoid over-digestion, limit the enzyme's exposure to high glycerol concentrations, and perform pilot experiments to determine the optimal enzyme amount.\n\nTo overcome digestion failure in a transformation experiment, it is essential to optimize and troubleshoot each step of the process, considering factors such as enzyme efficiency, reaction conditions, and DNA template quality."}]}, {"facetValue": "troubleshoot why a DNA digestion process did not work and suggest possible solutions.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "troubleshoot why the third digestion did not work and to receive suggestions for potential causes and troubleshooting steps."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "troubleshoot why a DNA digestion process did not work and suggest possible solutions."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "First digestion and gel electrophoresis\n\nLadder is clear, no problem with the gel\n\nIssues\nThe genomic uncut was not loaded therefore nothing to compare.\nNo bands visible \n\nReason \nThe concentration of loaded cut genomic was too low \nThe conecntartion of loaded sample should be atleast 50 \u00b5g/ \u00b5L for detection by Intron RedSafe\n\n- Image of first transformation attempt with contamination in the positive control (The experiment failed since the positive control contains contamination)\u000b\u000bNothing can be concluded as the plates were contaminated.\n\n\nNew genomic DNA with high concentration used to make sure sample is visible on the gel\n\nTo overcome the contamination problem, proper precautions were taken.

As per\nthis, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L which is very less than 50 ng/ \u00b5L as\nper the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\n(33.2 ng / \u00b5L \u00d7 10 \u00b5L in digestion) / (10 \u00b5L while loading) = 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L\n\nPart B write up 8\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nHence, nothing was detected.Furthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10\nwas not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes\nat 120 V under UV light.

It also shows that BamHI cuts at 662 position on\nplasmid DNA and HindIII cuts at 632 positions. Since we are using two different enzymes, there\nis a better chance that our fragment contains rspL gene.\nDiscussion\nThe primary objective of this project was to create a genomic library using a streptomycinresistant strain of E.coli Top10 (4537 bp) as the genomic DNA, incorporating it into a pUC19\nplasmid (2686 bp) vector (Cirino et al., 2003). The successful construction of this genomic\nlibrary was expected to confer streptomycin resistance to a recipient E.coli strain Mach1\nthrough the functional selection of the rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983). However, throughout the\nexperiment, several challenges were encountered, leading to changes in the experimental\ndesign and troubleshooting of errors.\nAn initial gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of the rspL gene after digestion\nof genomic DNA with BamHI resulted in no visible bands. This was primarily due to the low\nconcentration of the originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA (33.2 ng/\u00b5L), which was further\ndiluted during the digestion reaction and loading of the gel (Inoue et al., 1990). This\nconcentration was below the minimum detection limit required for the INtRON RedSafeTM\nnucleic acid stain to work efficiently (50 ng/\u00b5L). As a consequence, no bands were detected,\nand the experiment had to be repeated with a new and cleaned up genomic DNA sample.\nSubsequent gel electrophoresis performed after digesting the cleaned-up genomic DNA with\nBamHI showed successful digestion of the genomic Top10 DNA, as evidenced by a shorter\nsmear in comparison to the uncut band of the genomic DNA (Sorek et al., 2013). In addition, the\nplasmid pUC19 showed two very faint bands after digestion with BamHI, indicating appropriate\ndigestion of the plasmid as well.\nPart B write up 15\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nA ligation reaction was set up using a 1:1 ratio for cut genomic Top10 DNA (insert) and cut\nplasmid pUC19 (vector) (Chen & Dubnau, 2004). After overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C, the ligated\nproduct was transformed into Mach1 chemically competent cells. The initial transformation\nresults were inconclusive due to contamination observed in the positive control plate.\nMoreover, the second transformation attempt resulted in an unsuccessful transformation due\nto inefficient uptake of DNA by the host organism, which might have been caused by several\nfactors, such as improper preparation of competent cells, issues concerning the ligation\nreaction, or the transformation protocol itself (Inoue et al., 1990).\nTo increase the likelihood of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene, a third gel\nelectrophoresis was performed using HindIII in addition to BamHI for digesting both genomic\nTop10 DNA and plasmid pUC19 (Cirino et al., 2003). The use of two different enzymes would\nincrease the accuracy of the construct and facilitate the incorporation of the desired fragment\ninto the plasmid (Hanahan, 1983).\nBased on the information provided by the restriction analyzer, the BamHI enzyme cuts at two\ndifferent sites on genomic DNA (180 and 2865), producing large fragments that appeared as a\nsmear in the gel electrophoresis images (Sorek et al., 2013). HindIII was introduced to cut at an\nadditional site (4130) on genomic DNA, increasing the likelihood that the fragment containing\nthe rspL gene would be successfully incorporated into the plasmid (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nIn summary, the construction of a genomic library using E.coli Top10 genomic DNA and pUC19\nplasmid DNA encountered several challenges throughout the experiment, including low DNA\nconcentrations, contamination, and inefficient transformation (Inoue et al., 1990). The\nintroduction of the HindIII enzyme in addition to BamHI for restriction digestion was expected\nto increase the probability of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene (Cirino et al., 2003).\nFurthermore, troubleshooting in each area of competent cells preparation, ligation reaction,\nand transformation protocol can assist in identifying and rectifying these challenges, such as reevaluating the insert-to-vector ratio, incubation time, and temperature for the ligation reaction\nor testing and optimizing various transformation conditions (Hanahan, 1983).\nFor this experiment, the most likely problem would be with transformation. It could be\noptimized and modified by making changes mentioned below:\na. Temperature and duration: Confirm that the heat shock conditions (e.g. 42\u00b0C for 30-45\nseconds) are appropriate for your cells (Inoue et al., 1990).\nb. Recovery duration: Allow adequate time (usually 1 hour) for the cells to recover and express\nthe antibiotic resistance marker (Sorek et al., 2013).\nc. Optimal antibiotic concentration: Ensure the appropriate concentration of streptomycin for\nselection is used on the plates. Too high or low of a concentration may result in inadequate\nselection (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nPart B write up 16\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nIn addition to the technical challenges faced during the genomic library construction, human\nerrors could also have contributed to the unsuccessful or inconclusive results. These errors can\noccur in sample handling, reagent preparation, equipment usage, and protocol execution. Such\nerrors may include:\n1. Cross-contamination: During handling of samples, there is potential for cross-contamination\nbetween different DNA samples or between the samples and reagents, leading to undesired\nresults (Inoue et al., 1990).\n2. Reagent preparation: Errors can occur while preparing various reagents such as buffers,\nenzyme solutions, or antibiotics. These could include inaccurate measurement or mixing of\ncomponents, resulting in incorrect concentrations that can affect experimental outcomes\n(Sorek et al., 2013).\n3. Pipetting errors: Inaccurate pipetting can lead to incorrect volumes being dispensed, resulting\nin the incorrect sample or reagent concentration, which affects the outcome of experiments\n(Hanahan, 1983).\n4. Equipment usage: Improper operation, maintenance, or calibration of laboratory equipment\ncan generate unreliable or inconsistent results. For instance, inaccurate temperature settings\nfor incubation or heat shock can affect the transformation efficiency (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nTo minimize human errors, it is essential to maintain good laboratory practices, maintaining\nproper organization of the workspace, labeling samples accurately, and double-checking\nreagent concentrations. Additionally, regularly calibrating and maintaining equipment,\nfollowing established protocols carefully, and incorporating appropriate controls into\nexperiments will help reduce the occurrence of human errors and enhance the overall success\nof the genomic library construction process.\nFuture experiments can investigate alternative restriction enzymes, plasmid vectors, and\ncompetent cell strains to improve the overall success of the genomic library construction\nprocess (Cirino et al., 2003). Moreover, ensuring a suitable recovery time for transformed cells,\nproviding a nutrient-rich medium during recovery, using appropriate plating methods and\nconditions, and including positive and negative controls in each transformation experiment will\naid in enhancing the efficiency of the genomic library construction and subsequent functional\nselection of the streptomycin resistance-conferring rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983).\nConclusion\nPart B write up 17\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nIn conclusion, the construction of a genomic library using E.coli Top10 genomic DNA and pUC19\nplasmid DNA proved to be challenging due to several factors, including low DNA\nconcentrations, contamination, and inefficient transformation. Optimization of the\ntransformation process, selection of alternative restriction enzymes, plasmid vectors, and\ncompetent cell strains could enhance the overall success of the genomic library construction\nand subsequent functional selection of the streptomycin resistance-conferring rspL gene.\nFuture experiments should also emphasize proper controls, recovery conditions, and nutrientrich media to improve the efficiency of this process. \n\nuse the information from above and construct me ppt slides according to below:\n\n1.

The rise of social media platforms have brought immense changes in the way people connect, share and express their interests. As digital natives, Gen Z has grown up with social media and their experiences with music are likely to be different than previous generations. According to a report by Nielsen Music, over 80% of Gen Z listens to music on YouTube, and social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok have become a crucial tool for artists to promote their music and engage with their fan base (NME, 2020). Social media platforms provide ample opportunities for users to explore, discover, and share music that reflects their personal preferences. \n\nPreviously, music promotion was done through radio, television or physical sales, but now social media platforms and streaming services have taken over.When we talk about the significance of this topic both theoretically and socio-economically, we need to understand the impact of a music genre on the society and vice versa. The theoretical significance of this research is to understand how social media platforms shape the identity formation, as well as the cultural and social communication of music, amongst Gen Z individuals. By exploring the impact of social media on music preference, and using Social Cognitive theory, this research can further provide insight into how social media is influencing the music industry.\n\n\nLiterature review\nExisting research consistently highlights the significance of social media in the music discovery process for younger generations (Datta et al., 2017; Baym, 2017). For example, Datta et al. (2017) found that the adoption of online streaming significantly affects music consumption and discovery among listeners.\n\nLiterature has also explored the role of peer networks and online influencers on music preferences (Mart\u00ednez-Casta\u00f1o et al., 2016; Marwick, 2015). Mart\u00ednez-Casta\u00f1o et al. (2016) suggest that social media strategies, including the use of online influencers, can effectively promote indie music to listeners.\n\nWhile there is a growing body of literature on the role of social media in music preferences, few studies have specifically focused on Gen Z (Datta et al., 2017), who have grown up with social media as a central aspect of their lives. \n\nAdditionally, current literature does not fully address the complex and varying ways in which social media interacts with and influences individual listening habits and taste development. \n\nThis research aims to address these gaps by focusing on the music preferences of Gen Z in relation to social media use.\n\n\n1. Existing literature suggests that social media has a significant impact on music preferences among young adults. Strong evidence suggests that social media platforms such as Spotify, YouTube, and TikTok are the most popular sources of music for Gen Z population (Cicchetti, 2022). However, there is a lack of research on how and to what extent social media specifically influences music preferences.\n\n2. The research on social media\u2019s effect on music preferences has shown a positive relationship between social media use and musical taste formation (Meehan, 2019). Moreover, research suggests that social media can be an integral tool for music discovery and sharing amongst young adults and can play a role in shaping the music industry (Webster, 2021).\n\n3. Research on the impact of social media on music preferences suggests that social media allows for the creation of alternative music genres and subcultures that appeal to younger individuals (G\u00fcven, 2016). However, there is a gap in the literature in the study of how these genres and subcultures come into existence and what role social media plays in their formation.\n\n4. Various studies have also highlighted how social media contributes to the development of music fandoms, and the impact of fandoms on the music industry (Derbaix & Korchia, 2019). However, there is still a lack of understanding of how social media creates fan communities, and if these fan communities are influenced by social media algorithms.\n\n5. Research has shown that social media can lead to a phenomenon known as \"musical convergence\u201d (Vizca\u00edno-Verd\u00fa et al., 2023). Musical convergence occurs when individuals begin to share common musical tastes due to the influence of social media algorithms. However, the extent to which social media algorithms play a role in the formation of musical preferences is still not fully understood.\n\n6. Existing literature suggests that social media platforms can create a sense of community for individuals with niche musical interests (Sharabati et al., 2022). However, there is a lack of understanding on how social media facilitates human interaction within these communities.\n\n7. The existing literature has identified several challenges related to social media\u2019s impact on music preferences, among which is the lack of diversity in the music that is promoted through social media algorithms (Elliott & Reynolds, 2019). This research highlights the importance of exploring how social media can contribute to diversity in music preference.\n\nExisting literature suggests that social media has a significant impact on music preference among the younger population. However, there is still a lack of understanding of how and to what extent social media influences music preference among Gen Z. The above-discussed gap in the literature justifies the need for research to investigate the role of social media in shaping the music preference of Gen Z. While there is a growing body of literature on the role of social media in music preferences, few studies have specifically focused on Gen Z \n(Cohen & Rosenbaum, 2014), who have grown up with social media as a central aspect of their lives. This research aims to address these gaps by focusing on the music preferences of Gen Z in relation to social media use.\n\n\n\nResearch Questions\n\nThe major research question for this study is: What is the role of social media in shaping the music preferences of Gen Z?\n\nMinor questions include:\n\u2022 What specific social media platforms are most influential in shaping music preferences among Gen Z?\n\u2022 How do peer networks and online influencers contribute to the development of music preferences among Gen Z?\n\u2022 To what extent does exposure to diverse genres and artists through social media impact music taste development among Gen Z?\n\n\nMethods\nThe research design will be a mixed-methods approach, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis. This will allow for a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the relationship between social media use and music preferences among Gen Z.\n\nQuantitative data analysis: Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics will be used to analyze the quantitative data from the questionnaires. This will include computing frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations to explore relationships between variables of interest, such as social media use and music preferences.\n\nQualitative data analysis: Thematic analysis will be employed to analyze the qualitative data from the semi-structured interviews. Data will be coded into relevant themes and categories to identify patterns and trends within the participants\u2019 accounts of their social media use and music preferences.\n\nData will be collected through a combination of online questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. The questionnaire will focus on demographic information, general social media use, and specific music preferences. The semi-structured interviews will allow participants to provide more in-depth insight into the ways in which social media has influenced their music preferences.\n\nOnline questionnaires: These will gather quantitative data on demographic information, general social media use, and specific music preferences of the Gen Z participants. Questions will be designed to capture general patterns and trends and will include multiple-choice, ranking, and Likert scale questions.\n\nSemi-structured interviews: Conducted via video or audio calls, these interviews will collect qualitative data from a subset of participants who completed the questionnaires. The aim is to gather more in-depth and nuanced information regarding the relationship between social media use and music preferences. Interview questions will be open-ended and follow up on themes identified from the questionnaires.\n\nA convenience sampling strategy will be used, with participants being recruited through social media platforms commonly used by Gen Z, such as Instagram and TikTok. Potential issues in conducting the research may include challenges in gaining access to respondents or concerns about anonymity in participation. There may also be ethical issues surrounding the collection of personal information from younger participants.\n\nBy employing a mixed-methods approach and carefully designing data collection instruments, this study will comprehensively address the research questions and contribute to the existing literature on the role of social media in shaping music preferences among Gen Z."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Additionally, this research will provide insights into how social media is influencing the music industry, and offer recommendations on how artists and the music industry can leverage social media platforms to better understand and connect with their audience.

Questions will be designed to capture general patterns and trends and will include multiple-choice, ranking, and Likert scale questions.\n\nSemi-structured interviews will be conducted via video or audio calls and will collect more in-depth and nuanced information regarding the relationship between social media use and music preferences. Interview questions will be open-ended and follow up on themes identified from the questionnaires.\n\nSampling Strategy:\n\nThe sampling strategy for this study will be convenience sampling, with participants being recruited through social media platforms commonly used by Gen Z, such as Instagram and TikTok. Convenience sampling has been chosen as it is the most appropriate given the limitations imposed on research during Covid-19. While this method may introduce some degree of selection bias, care will be taken to ensure that the sample is as representative as possible within the constraints of the study.\n\nPotential Problems:\n\nPotential issues in conducting the research may include challenges in gaining access to respondents, concerns about anonymity in participation, and ethical issues surrounding the collection of personal information from younger participants. To address these issues, consent forms will be provided to participants, and all data will be kept confidential and anonymous.\n\nData Analysis:\n\nQuantitative data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and inferential statistics, such as chi-square tests and correlation analysis, to explore relationships between variables of interest, such as social media use and music preferences.\n\nQualitative data will be analyzed using thematic analysis. Data will be coded into relevant themes and categories to identify patterns and trends within the participants\u2019 accounts of their social media use and music preferences.\n\nEthics:\n\nThe safety of participants will be ensured by making sure that they are fully informed of the research aims and procedures. They will be informed that participation is voluntary and that they can opt out at any time. Consent forms will be utilized, and data confidentiality will be observed at all times.\n\nLimitations:\n\nWhile the mixed-methods approach provides a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the relationship between social media use and music preferences among Gen Z, there may still be limitations to the study. Convenience sampling may introduce some degree of selection bias, and the use of self-report measures may be subject to social desirability biases. To mitigate these limitations, care will be taken to ensure that the sample is representative, and the research instruments will be designed to minimize social desirability biases. Additionally, the study will be limited to a sample of Gen Z within certain geographical boundaries, and findings may not be generalizable to other populations."}, {"role": "user", "content": "could you help me with my literature review, to make it more relevant to the topic and more logical"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, I can definitely help you improve your literature review for your research topic.

This literature review provides an overview of the existing research on the role of social media in music preference, with a specific focus on Gen Z, a demographic group born between 1997 and 2012.\n\nMusic Preference Among Gen Z:\nResearch suggests that social media platforms play a significant role in shaping the music preferences of Gen Z (Cicchetti, 2022). Over 80% of Gen Z listens to music on YouTube, and social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok have become essential tools for artists to promote their music and engage with their fan base (NME, 2020). However, few studies have specifically explored the impact of social media on music preferences among Gen Z.\n\nThe Influence of Social Media on Music Discovery:\nExisting research consistently highlights the significance of social media in the music discovery process for younger generations (Datta et al., 2017; Baym, 2017). For example, Datta et al. (2017) found that the adoption of online streaming significantly affects music consumption and discovery among listeners. This suggests that social media platforms can impact music preference by influencing the way people discover and consume music.\n\nThe Role of Peer Networks and Online Influencers:\nResearch has also explored the role of peer networks and online influencers on music preferences (Mart\u00ednez-Casta\u00f1o et al., 2016; Marwick, 2015). Mart\u00ednez-Casta\u00f1o et al. (2016) suggest that social media strategies, including the use of online influencers, can effectively promote indie music to listeners. However, the extent to which peer networks and online influencers influence music preference among Gen Z needs further investigation.\n\nExposure to Diverse Genres and Artists:\nSocial media platforms provide ample opportunities for users to explore, discover, and share music that reflects their personal preferences. Research suggests that social media can contribute to the creation of alternative music genres and subcultures that appeal to younger individuals (G\u00fcven, 2016). However, there is a gap in the literature in the study of how these genres and subcultures come into existence and what role social media plays in their formation.\n\nMusic Fandoms and Social Media:\nVarious studies have highlighted how social media contributes to the development of music fandoms, and the impact of fandoms on the music industry (Derbaix & Korchia, 2019). However, there is still a lack of understanding of how social media creates fan communities and if these fan communities are influenced by social media algorithms.\n\nSocial Media Algorithms and Musical Convergence:\nResearch has shown that social media can lead to a phenomenon known as \"musical convergence\u201d (Vizca\u00edno-Verd\u00fa et al., 2023). Musical convergence occurs when individuals begin to share common musical tastes due to the influence of social media algorithms. However, the extent to which social media algorithms play a role in the formation of musical preferences among Gen Z needs further exploration.\n\nThe Role of Social Media in Creating Niche Music Communities:\nSocial media platforms can create a sense of community for individuals with niche musical interests (Sharabati et al., 2022). However, there is a lack of understanding on how social media facilitates human interaction within these communities, as well as the impact of these communities on music preference and identity formation among Gen Z.\n\nConclusion:\nThis literature review has provided insights into the existing research on the role of social media in music preference among Gen Z, highlighting the significance of social media platforms in shaping music preferences. However, few studies have specifically focused on Gen Z, and there are still gaps in the literature on the impact of social media on music preference among this demographic group. The proposed research aims to address these gaps and provide a better understanding of the influence of social media on the cultural and social communication of music and how it is shaping the"}]}, {"facetValue": "conduct an ethical and methodical examination of statistical studies, including the design of randomized experiments and observational studies related to physical fitness and environmental health.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "understand how to design and conduct statistical studies, including randomized experiments and observational studies, for questions related to improving race times through weightlifting and the potential cause of lung cancer from PM2.5 exposure."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "conduct an ethical and methodical examination of statistical studies, including the design of randomized experiments and observational studies related to physical fitness and environmental health."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "Suppose we would like to conduct statistical studies on the following two questions:\n(I) Can lifting weights (\u8209\u91cd) improve runners' time in a 10-kilometer race?

This can be an example of a case-control study or cohort study. In a case-control study, individuals with lung cancer (the cases) would be compared with a control group without lung cancer, while in a cohort study, individuals with different levels of exposure to PM2.5 would be tracked over time.\n\nHowever, it is not ethical to expose individuals to PM2.5 for the purpose of a randomized experiment as there is a known link between exposure to such air pollution and negative health impacts, including lung cancer.

The control group should be similar to the case group in terms of gender, age, and other important characteristics.

The participants will be asked about their residential and occupational histories, as well as their lifestyles, so that estimates of their exposure to PM2.5 can be calculated. Exposure to PM2.5 is typically measured by monitoring the air quality and using mathematical models to estimate the levels of exposure.

By analyzing various aspects, such as financial stability, work-life balance, relationship status, gender roles, and cultural expectations, this research will shed light on the mindset of Filipino Gen Z when it comes to family planning and aspirations for parenthood. The methodology adopted for this study consists of conducting surveys and interviews among Filipino Gen Z individuals and analyzing the data to identify trends and correlations between various factors influencing their decision to have children.\n\nIntroduction:\n\n1.1 Defining Generation Z in the Filipino context\nGeneration Z refers to individuals born between 1997 and 2012; they are considered the most diverse, digitally native, and socially conscious generation. In the Philippines, they make up a significant portion of the population and have grown up with unique experiences that have shaped their perspectives, values, and principles. This study acknowledges these nuances by focusing on how Generation Z's attitudes differ from their predecessors.\n\n1.2 Brief overview of the socio-economic and cultural changes in the Philippines\nRecent years have seen significant socio-economic and cultural shifts in the Philippines, including a rapidly growing economy, urbanization, increased education levels, and changes in traditional family structures. These changes have impacted the way young Filipinos perceive traditional family planning and the desire to have children.\n\nLiterature Review:\n\n2.1 Previous studies on Generation Z's attitudes towards parenthood and family planning\nVarious studies have examined how Generation Z's values, priorities, and lifestyle choices influence their attitudes towards parenthood. They highlight the impact of factors such as higher education levels, delayed marriage, increased workforce participation, and greater access to information as determinants of their family planning decisions.\n\n2.2 Comparative studies on the attitudes towards parenthood among different generations\nComparative studies indicate that Generation Z is significantly different from previous generations in terms of their perceptions of parenthood. While financial stability, work-life balance, and relationships play crucial roles in their decision-making process, the influence of cultural norms and traditions seems to be decreasing.\n\nMethodology:\n\n3.1 Conducting surveys and interviews among Filipino Gen Z individuals\nTo gather primary data on the attitudes of Filipino Gen Z towards having children, a mixed-method approach involving surveys and interviews will be employed. A representative sample of participants from various regions, educational backgrounds, and socio-economic statuses will be targeted to gather diverse perspectives.\n\n3.2 Analyzing the collected data to identify trends and correlations between various factors that influence the decision to have children\nThe research will employ statistical tools to analyze the survey responses and draw meaningful correlations between the different factors influencing Gen Z's attitudes towards having children. Interview transcripts will be analyzed using thematic content analysis, which will help identify key themes and patterns.\n\nResults:\n\n4.1 Presenting the findings of the attitudes towards having children among Filipino Generation Z\nThe results will provide insights into the attitudes of Filipino Gen Z towards parenthood, including their aspirations, concerns, and expectations. Factors such as financial stability, work-life balance, and gender roles will be discussed, and trends that emerged from the data analysis will be outlined.\n\n4.2 Comparing and contrasting the results with those of previous generations\nA comparative analysis with previous generations will reveal the similarities and differences in attitudes towards parenthood among Filipino youth. This contrast will contribute to the understanding of how societal changes have influenced the mindset of Filipino Gen Z.\n\nDiscussion:\n\n5.1 Analyzing the factors that contribute to the decision-making process of Filipino Gen Z with regard to having children\nThe results will provide insights into the factors that contribute to the decision-making process of Filipino Gen Z. This analysis will help understand their attitudes and concerns, which can be vital for directly tackling issues surrounding family planning, relationships, and work-life balance.\n\n5.2 Understanding the impact of socio-economic, cultural, and individual factors on the decision to have children\nThe discussion will delve into how the different factors collaborate to define the attitudes of Filipino Gen Z. This will help offer comprehensive knowledge of their perspective and create a basis for future research and policy discussions.\n\nConclusion:\n\n6.1 Summarizing the findings and providing recommendations for future research on this topic\nThe concluding remarks will summarize the key findings, highlighting the attitudes and concerns of Filipino Gen Z towards parenthood. It will also outline potential areas for future research, contributing to the growing body of literature on this topic.\n\n6.2 Discussing the implications for policymakers, educators, and other stakeholders in addressing the needs and aspirations of Filipino Generation Z when it comes to parenthood\nThe study's findings will provide valuable information for policymakers, educators, and other stakeholders.

Self-selection bias: Since participation in StateArt was voluntary, the students who chose to play the game might have been more motivated or interested in the subject matter than those who did not play. These motivated students might have been more likely to perform better in the course regardless of whether they played StateArt or not.\n\n2.

This extra time spent on the subject might have contributed to their better performance in the course, not necessarily the game itself.\n\n(ii) How each rival cause could account for the StateArt\u2013student performance relationship:\n\n1. Self-selection bias: If more motivated or interested students self-selected into the group of StateArt players, their higher motivation or interest could be the true cause behind their better performance in the course. In this case, the relationship between playing StateArt and better performance might be spurious, as the true cause would be the students' higher motivation or interest.\n\n2. Additional time spent on IR content: If the students who played StateArt spent more time engaging with the course content due to the game, their better performance might be a result of the extra time spent learning about IR rather than the game itself. In this case, any additional study that similarly engaged students with IR content would likely have the same effect on their performance.\n\nSuppose the instructor would like to improve his procedure for determining whether StateArt causes better performance in achieving course objectives:\n\n(i) Three recommended methodological steps:\n\n1. Random assignment: Divide students into two groups through random assignment, with one group designated as the treatment group that plays StateArt and the other as the control group that does not play the game.\n\n2. Pretest and posttest: Administer a pretest before the intervention and a posttest after the intervention to measure any changes in students' performance or understanding of IR subject matter in both the treatment and control groups.\n\n3. Standardize the amount of exposure: Ensure that the treatment group spends a specific amount of time playing StateArt, and provide a comparable alternative activity or study time for the control group to make sure differences in exposure or time spent on the subject matter do not confound the results.\n\n(ii) Explanation of why these steps would help isolate the effect of StateArt on student performance:\n\n1. Random assignment helps eliminate self-selection bias and other confounding variables by making the treatment and control groups similar in all respects except for the intervention (i.e., playing StateArt). This allows the researcher to determine the cause-and-effect relationship between StateArt and student performance more conclusively.\n\n2. Pretest and posttest assessments measure students' progress in both the treatment and control groups, allowing the researcher to compare changes in performance between the two groups. If the treatment group shows a significantly greater improvement in performance than the control group, it would suggest that StateArt does have a positive effect on student performance.\n\n3. Standardizing the amount of exposure to StateArt and providing a comparable alternative for the control group ensures that any differences in performance are due to StateArt itself rather than the extra time spent on IR content.

This famous experiment involved Watson and his research assistant, Rosalie Rayner, who conditioned an 11-month-old boy, dubbed \"Little Albert,\" to fear a previously neutral stimulus (a white rat) by pairing it with a loud noise that elicited a fear response. The use of fear conditioning in such a vulnerable subject raises ethical concerns about consent, harm, and the lasting psychological effects of the study. The fate of Little Albert has been debated for decades, with speculation surrounding his life after the study and whether he suffered any long-term consequences. This essay will examine the various theories and sources on this topic and attempt to shed light on what became of Watson's most famous subject.\n\nTheory 1: Albert B - The Popular Belief\n\nThe most widely accepted theory about the identity of Little Albert is that he was a boy named Albert B, born to a nurse who worked at the Johns Hopkins Hospital where Watson conducted his experiment. A much-cited investigation conducted by Beck, Levinson, and Irons (2009) offered evidence suggesting that Albert B was the child in question. According to these researchers, Albert B lived a relatively normal life after the experiment, with no reports of lasting psychological trauma. However, he tragically died at the age of six from a congenital condition unrelated to the experiment (Beck, Levinson, & Irons, 2009). Paula Fass, a researcher who analyzed the letters between Watson and Rayner, argues that Albert B's death had a profound impact on Watson, leading him to leave academia to pursue a career in advertising (Fass, 2016). \n\nTheory 2: Douglas Merritte - A Reexamination\n\nIn recent years, an alternative theory about Little Albert's identity has emerged. In 2012, psychologists Russell A. Powell, Nancy Digdon, and Ben Harris published a book arguing that Little Albert was not Albert B, but rather a boy named Douglas Merritte. Their assertion is based on a detailed analysis of Watson's records from the experiment, as well as information obtained from census records, city directories, and birth and death records (Powell, Digdon, & Harris, 2012). They argue that key discrepancies between the records for Albert B and the details of the Little Albert experiment make it unlikely that he was the child in question. Instead, they present evidence suggesting that Douglas Merritte, who also died at a young age from complications related to hydrocephalus, fits the profile better. Furthermore, the researchers argue that the hydrocephalus might have caused cognitive and developmental issues that made the infant more susceptible to fear conditioning, calling into question the validity of Watson's experimental findings (Powell, Digdon, & Harris, 2012).\n\nTheory 3: Contradictions and Doubts\n\nHowever, the identification of Little Albert as either Albert B or Douglas Merritte has been a subject of controversy and disagreement. In response to Powell and colleagues' claims, Tom Bartlett, writing in The Chronicle of Higher Education, argues that there is a lack of definitive proof tying either boy to the experiment. In reviewing the archival records and evidence related to Watson's study, Bartlett finds inconsistencies in the dates, locations, and personal details surrounding both Albert B and Douglas Merritte, concluding that the true identity of Little Albert remains elusive (Bartlett, 2014).\n\nRecent Developments and Ethical Concerns\n\nAs the debate over Little Albert's identity continues, one point remains clear: the ethical considerations of Watson's experiment are still relevant today. Exposing a vulnerable infant to fear-inducing stimuli, without apparent debriefing or long-term follow-up, raises significant concerns about the possible psychological harm done to the child. Christian Jarrett, a cognitive neuroscientist and author, discusses the ethical implications of the Little Albert experiment, emphasizing the importance of obtaining informed consent from participants, minimizing harm, and ensuring follow-up care (Jarrett, 2017).\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the fate of Little Albert is a matter of ongoing debate and speculation. While some researchers claim to have identified him as either Albert B or Douglas Merritte, others question the validity of these assertions due to inconsistencies in the available evidence. Regardless of the precise details of Little Albert's life and death, the experiment serves as a stark reminder of the importance of ethical treatment of human subjects in psychological research, prompting greater scrutiny of research practices and the need for rigorous ethical guidelines.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBartlett, T.

Here are some steps to use a conjoint experiment design:\n\n1. Identify the attributes and levels: Determine the product attributes and levels that you want to test. For example, if you are testing a new coffee product, attributes may include the type of bean, roast level, packaging, price, and brand.\n\n2. Create scenarios: Develop different scenarios that include combinations of attributes and levels. For example, you could create a scenario where the coffee is made from Arabica beans, is medium roast, comes in a recyclable pod, and costs $10 per box.\n\n3. Determine the sample: Decide on the sample size and target audience to participate in the study. You may use a survey tool to collect data from the target audience.\n\n4. Conduct the survey: Send the survey to the participants and ask them to evaluate the different scenarios. You can use a rating scale or a choice-based approach, asking participants to select their preferred option from a set of hypothetical products.\n\n5. Analyze the data: Analyze the data to identify the most preferred set of attributes and levels. You can use statistical techniques such as regression analysis to estimate the relative importance of each attribute and level.\n\n6. Interpret the results: Use the results to make informed business decisions, such as determining the optimal product attributes and pricing for the coffee product.\n\nOverall, using a conjoint experiment design is a useful tool to understand how consumers evaluate different product features, and can guide strategic decisions in product development and marketing."}, {"role": "user", "content": "how to calculate the AMCE in the design"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "AMCE (Average Marginal Component Effect) is a statistical measure used to determine the average impact of the individual levels of each attribute on the overall preference score. Here are the steps to calculate the AMCE in a conjoint experiment design:\n\n1. Estimate the individual Part-worths: Use regression analysis on the collected data to estimate the part-worths for each level of every attribute.\n\n2. Calculate the Marginal Utility: Calculate the difference between the part-worths of each level of the same attribute. This is the marginal utility of each level.\n\n3. Compute the AMCE: Sum the marginal utility of each level and divide by the range of the attribute. This will give you the AMCE of each attribute.\n\nFor example, let's assume we have a coffee product with three attributes: roast level (dark, medium, light), origin (Brazil, Colombia, Ethiopia), and packaging (bag, can, pod). We have collected data from a sample of consumers and calculated the part-worths, which are as follows: \n\n- Dark roast preference: 2.5 \n- Medium roast preference: 1.0 \n- Light roast preference: -1.5 \n- Brazil origin preference: 3.0 \n- Colombia origin preference: -1.0 \n- Ethiopia origin preference: -2.0 \n- Bag packaging preference: 4.0 \n- Can packaging preference: 1.0 \n- Pod packaging preference: -5.0 \n\nUsing the above information, we can calculate the marginal utility and AMCE for each attribute:\n\n1. Roast level: \n\n- Dark vs. Medium: 2.5 - 1.0 = 1.5 \n- Medium vs. Light: 1.0 - (-1.5) = 2.5 \n\nThe average marginal component effect for roast level would be (1.5 + 2.5)/2 = 2.0 \n\n2. Origin: \n\n- Brazil vs. Colombia: 3.0 - (-1.0) = 4.0 \n- Brazil vs. Ethiopia: 3.0 - (-2.0) = 5.0 \n\nThe average marginal component effect for origin would be (4.0 + 5.0)/2 = 4.5 \n\n3. Packaging: \n\n- Bag vs. Can: 4.0 - 1.0 = 3.0 \n- Bag vs. Pod: 4.0 - (-5.0) = 9.0 \n\nThe average marginal component effect for packaging would be (3.0 + 9.0)/2 = 6.0 \n\nTherefore, in this example, the AMCE indicates that packaging has the highest impact on overall preference, followed by origin and roast level."}]}, {"facetValue": "explain joint selection sets and experimental design concepts without revealing any personally identifiable information.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "explain the concepts of alternatives and choice sets, and how they relate to experimental design in data mining and machine learning."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "explain joint selection sets and experimental design concepts without revealing any personally identifiable information."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the meaning of Alternatives and choice sets"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Alternatives refer to different options or courses of action that can be pursued in order to attain a specific objective or goal.

{"role": "user", "content": "how Pentacyclic triterpenoid acid kills the bacteria"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Pentacyclic triterpenoid acid has been found to have antibacterial properties, which means that it can kill bacteria. There are several mechanisms by which pentacyclic triterpenoid acid kills bacteria.\n\nFirstly, pentacyclic triterpenoid acid can cause damage to the bacterial cell membrane. The cell membrane is a vital part of the bacterial cell, as it acts as a barrier that protects the cell from the environment. Pentacyclic triterpenoid acid can disrupt the cell membrane by forming pores, which allow substances to leak out of the cell. This causes the bacteria to lose essential nutrients and fluids, which eventually leads to death.\n\nSecondly, pentacyclic triterpenoid acid can interfere with bacterial cell metabolism. Bacteria need to take in nutrients and convert them into energy in order to survive. Pentacyclic triterpenoid acid can inhibit key enzymes and pathways involved in bacterial metabolism, which can lead to a build-up of toxic products inside the cell. This can cause oxidative stress and ultimately lead to cell death.\n\nThirdly, pentacyclic triterpenoid acid can disrupt bacterial DNA synthesis. DNA is the genetic material that controls all of the cell's functions, and blocking its synthesis can cause the bacteria to malfunction. Pentacyclic triterpenoid acid can bind to the DNA molecule and prevent it from replicating, which can kill the bacteria.\n\nLastly, pentacyclic triterpenoid acid can stimulate the immune system to fight off bacteria. By activating certain immune cells, pentacyclic triterpenoid acid can help the body to recognize and eliminate bacterial pathogens. This makes it an effective tool for preventing and treating bacterial infections.\n\nIn summary, pentacyclic triterpenoid acid can kill bacteria through several mechanisms, including damage to the bacterial cell membrane, interference with bacterial metabolism, disruption of DNA synthesis, and stimulation of the immune system. These properties make pentacyclic triterpenoid acid a promising candidate for developing new drugs and treatments for bacterial infections."}, {"role": "user", "content": "pentacyclic triterpenoid acid affect nrf"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Pentacyclic triterpenoid acid has been found to affect Nrf (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor) signaling pathways. Nrf is a transcription factor that plays an important role in regulating the body's response to oxidative stress and inflammation. It is also involved in the regulation of many other biological processes, including cell growth, metabolism, and immune function.\n\nStudies have shown that pentacyclic triterpenoid acid can activate the Nrf signaling pathway. This activation leads to the production of endogenous antioxidants, such as glutathione, which protects cells against oxidative damage. Pentacyclic triterpenoid acid can also upregulate the expression of other Nrf-regulated genes, including those involved in cellular repair and detoxification.\n\nAdditionally, pentacyclic triterpenoid acid can inhibit the activity of enzymes that degrade Nrf. By inhibiting these enzymes, pentacyclic triterpenoid acid increases the levels of Nrf in the cell and enhances its activity. This further enhances the body's ability to combat oxidative stress and inflammation. \n\nFurthermore, pentacyclic triterpenoid acid has been found to inhibit the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes (NOD-like receptor protein 3), which are involved in the body's immune response to pathogen infection and tissue damage. The inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasomes reduces the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, which can help to reduce inflammation.\n\nIn summary, pentacyclic triterpenoid acid affects Nrf signaling pathways by activating the production of endogenous antioxidants and upregulating the expression of Nrf-regulated genes involved in cellular repair and detoxification. It also inhibits the activity of enzymes that degrade Nrf, leading to an increase in its activity. Additionally, it inhibits the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes, which can reduce inflammation.

Olive oil is produced from the fruit of the olive tree, which is rich in health-promoting compounds. Among these compounds, triterpenoid acid is a significant element. Triterpenoid acids are a group of terpenoids that possess 30-carbon long structures. They are natural compounds found in a wide range of plants, including olive. The most common types of triterpenoid acids found in olives are Ursolic acid, Oleanolic acid, and Maslinic acid. This review will describe the background of triterpenoid acid in olive, types of triterpenoid acid found in olives, industry processes affecting triterpenoid acid levels in olive oil, the impact of triterpenoid acid on the cell path, and how triterpenoid acid affects human health.\n\nBackground:\n\nOlives (Olea europaea) are one of the oldest crops known to humankind, with a history dating back to ancient civilizations. They are the fruit of the olive tree, which is native to the Mediterranean region. Olive trees are evergreen and are well adapted to the hot and dry conditions of the Mediterranean climate. Olive oil production is important to many countries, including Spain, Greece, and Italy.\n\nTriterpenoid Acid Types in Olive:\n\nTriterpenoid acid is a group of terpenoids with 30-carbon long structures. Three major types of triterpenoid acids have been identified in olive: Ursolic acid, Oleanolic acid, and Maslinic acid. Ursolic acid is a pentacyclic triterpenoid found in many plants, including olives. Oleanolic acid is a natural triterpenoid found in many herbal remedies and has antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects. Maslinic acid is another triterpenoid acid found in specific parts of the olive tree, including the leaves, fruits, and edible oil. Maslinic acid exhibits strong antitumor and antioxidant properties.\n\nIndustry Processes Affecting Triterpenoid Acid Levels in Olive Oil:\n\nThe concentration of triterpenoid acid in olive oil depends on various factors, including the ripening stage of the olives, the harvesting time, the production method, storage conditions, and environmental conditions. The type of oil extraction process also affects the concentration of triterpenoid acid. The traditional method, also known as the pressing method, produces olive oil with higher levels of triterpenoid acids compared to modern methods such as solvent extraction. The traditional extraction method involves crushing the olives and separating the oil by centrifugation. This method is known to produce higher amounts of triterpenoid acid in olive oil.\n\nImpact of Triterpenoid Acid on Cell Path:\n\nVarious studies have shown that triterpenoid acid, especially maslinic acid, has remarkable activity against various diseases, including cancer. Triterpenoid acids have the ability to induce cell apoptosis, inhibit cell proliferation, and suppress angiogenesis. These properties make triterpenoid acid an attractive target for cancer treatment. Triterpenoid acid has also shown neuroprotective effects by reducing toxicity caused by amyloid in brain cells. Maslinic acid has been shown to prevent the development of liver fibrosis and vascular inflammation. Therefore, triterpenoid acid holds potential for the treatment of various diseases.\n\nTriterpenoid Acid Affects Human Health:\n\nTriterpenoid acid-rich olive oil consumption is linked with several health benefits, including reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer. Ursolic acid has been found to have anti-inflammatory and anti-hyperlipidemic effects, making it attractive for the effective treatment of metabolic disorders. Maslinic acid has strong anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory activities that make it potential for anti-cancer treatment. Additionally, triterpenoid acid has been shown to have anti-aging properties. Thus, incorporating olive oil in a daily diet may promote overall health and well-being.\n\nConclusion:\n\nTriterpenoid acid is an essential component of olive oil, and its health benefits are worth exploring. Triterpenoid acid is a group of terpenoids found in numerous plants, including olives. The method of olive oil production has a significant impact on the concentration of triterpenoid acid present in the oil. The traditional method of production is the most favorable for retaining maximum amounts of triterpenoid acids. Triterpenoid acid found in olive oil has potential therapeutic benefits and exhibits remarkable activity against many diseases. Regular consumption of olive oil has been demonstrated to have numerous health benefits, including reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer. Identifying the health benefits of olive oil offers researchers new opportunities to realize the potential of these natural compounds in promoting human health."}, {"role": "user", "content": "make more details for cell-path part."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The impact of triterpenoid acid on cell path is a relatively new area of research, but the initial results are promising. Many studies have found that triterpenoid acid, particularly maslinic acid, can inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Maslinic acid has shown significant anticancer potential by activating various pathways that lead to cell death.\n\nOne of the ways that triterpenoid acid can affect cell path is by inhibiting angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is the process by which new blood vessels are formed, and it is essential for the growth and spread of cancer cells. Triterpenoid acid has been found to reduce angiogenesis by suppressing the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a protein that stimulates the formation of new blood vessels.\n\nAnother way triterpenoid acid can impact cell path is by reducing inflammation. Inflammation is a key factor in the development and progression of many diseases, including cancer. Triterpenoid acid has been found to have significant anti-inflammatory properties by reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibiting the activity of enzymes that contribute to inflammation.\n\nIn addition, maslinic acid has shown neuroprotective effects by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in brain cells. It has also been found to prevent the accumulation of beta-amyloid in the brain, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nTriterpenoid acid has also shown potential for the treatment of liver diseases. Liver fibrosis is a chronic condition that can lead to liver cirrhosis and eventually liver failure. Triterpenoid acid has been found to inhibit the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which play a critical role in the development of liver fibrosis. Triterpenoid acid has also been shown to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in the liver, which are essential factors in the progression of liver disease.\n\nOverall, triterpenoid acid has significant potential in the field of medicine by targeting various cellular pathways that contribute to the development and progression of several diseases.

These alkaloids have significant pharmaceutical importance, particularly in cancer treatment. \n\nMaterials and Methods:\nOur approach to this bioassay consisted of four main steps. \n\nStep 1: Plant material collection and protoplast isolation\nWe began by collecting plant material from Catharanthus roseus and subsequently isolating the protoplasts for further processing.\n\nStep 2: Micro-colony, callus and embryo formation\nFollowing protoplast isolation, we cultured the material to encourage the formation of micro-colonies, calli, and embryos as our in-vitro system for alkaloid production.\n\nStep 3: Yeast extract treatment as an elicitor\nTo stimulate the production of vinblastine and vincristine, we introduced a yeast extract to our in-vitro system, acting as an elicitor. The extract was carefully calibrated to optimize the yield while maintaining a healthy culture system.\n\nStep 4: Quantification of vinblastine and vincristine using HPLC\nAfter the elicitor treatment, we quantified the levels of vinblastine and vincristine produced by the cultured cells using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).\n\nResults:\nThe results of this bioassay were promising. We found that the yeast extract elicitation method proved to be effective in improving the extraction and enhancing the yield of alkaloids such as vinblastine and vincristine from the Catharanthus roseus plant. The increased alkaloid yield suggests potential applicability in industrial pharmaceutical production, particularly in the area of cancer treatment.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, the yeast extract elicitation bioassay presents a viable option to boost the production of medicinally valuable alkaloids, mainly vinblastine and vincristine, from the Catharanthus roseus plant.

Aneuploidy: Errors in chromosome segregation during meiosis can result in aneuploidy, where there is an abnormal number of chromosomes in the gametes (either too many or too few). This may lead to infertility, miscarriages, or genetic disorders such as Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, or trisomy 13.\n\n2. Failure to extrude the second polar body: If the oocyte fails to extrude the second polar body, it may retain an additional set of chromosomes. This can lead to triploid embryos, which are generally not viable and may result in miscarriages or developmental abnormalities.\n\n3. Polyploidy: Sometimes, the oocyte does not resume meiosis but still gets fertilized. This may lead to the formation of a polyploid embryo, which usually cannot survive and may lead to miscarriage or developmental defects.\n\n4. Premature resumption of meiosis: If the oocyte resumes meiosis too early, it may not have sufficient time to complete all the necessary developmental processes required for successful fertilization and embryonic growth. This may lead to fertilization failure or developmental abnormalities in the embryo.\n\n5. Parthenogenesis: In some cases, errors in the meiotic process can result in the activation of the oocyte without fertilization, leading to the development of an embryo with only maternal chromosomes. This process, known as parthenogenesis, usually results in non-viable embryos or developmental abnormalities.\n\n6. Imprinting disorders: Errors in the meiotic process can also cause errors in the epigenetic regulation, such as genomic imprinting. This may result in imprinting disorders like Angelman syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome, which are associated with developmental and neurological abnormalities.\n\n7. Infertility: Any defects in the meiotic process or polar body extrusion could adversely affect oocyte maturation and hence fertilization, leading to infertility.\n\nThese defects highlight the importance of the meiotic process and the extrusion of the second polar body in maintaining proper chromosome count and genomic integrity in embryos, ensuring successful development and the overall reproductive health of an individual."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what will happen if polyspermy happend in deep detail"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Polyspermy is the condition in which an egg is fertilized by more than one sperm cell. Normally, the fertilization process involves one sperm fusing with one egg, forming a zygote with a diploid number of chromosomes. However, when polyspermy occurs, there is an excess of genetic material within the zygote, which leads to various developmental abnormalities and ultimately lethality. Here is a detailed description of the consequences of polyspermy:\n\n1. Triploid or polyploid zygotes: If multiple sperm cells fertilize an egg, it results in a zygote with extra sets of chromosomes, making it triploid, tetraploid or polyploid, depending on the number of sperm involved. For example, if two sperm fertilize an egg, it forms a triploid zygote with three sets of chromosomes instead of the normal diploid state with two sets of chromosomes.\n\n2. Abnormal gene expression: The extra genetic material causes an imbalance in gene expression, disrupting the normal patterns of gene activation and repression at different stages of development. This interferes with the essential molecular cues required for proper embryonic development, cell differentiation, and tissue formation.\n\n3. Imbalanced genomic imprinting: Genomic imprinting is a phenomenon wherein certain genes are expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. With the extra genetic material from multiple sperm, the delicate balance in imprinted genes is disrupted, potentially leading to developmental abnormalities or even embryonic lethality.\n\n4. Embryonic lethality: In most cases, the presence of extra genetic material is lethal during the early stages of embryonic development. Polyspermic embryos often fail to progress beyond the initial cleavage stages, leading to the embryo's degeneration or resorption.\n\n5. Abnormal organ or tissue development: If a polyspermic embryo somehow manages to develop further, it is likely to exhibit various developmental defects, including abnormal organ formation or tissue differentiation, which might result in birth defects or stillbirths.\n\n6. Mosaicism or chimerism: In rare instances, polyspermy may result in the development of a chimeric or mosaic organism, where different cells within an individual contain different genetic information. Such individuals face multiple health challenges, depending on the severity and extent of mosaicism.\n\nIn summary, polyspermy leads to an excess of genetic material within the zygote, causing severe disruptions to normal developmental processes. In the vast majority of cases, this results in embryo inviability, but when viable embryos are formed, there is a significant chance of developmental abnormalities or genetic disorders. To prevent polyspermy, various mechanisms are in place, such as fast and slow polyspermy blocks, which tightly control the entry of sperm into the egg during the fertilization process."}]},
