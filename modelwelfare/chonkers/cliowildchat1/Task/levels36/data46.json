Wang Xizhi was born into a prominent family in present-day Shanxi province, and developed a love for calligraphy from a young age. He studied under several masters and eventually became known as the greatest calligrapher of his time.\n\nLegend has it that Wang Xizhi was not content with his mortal life and yearned for immortality. He sought out Taoist sages and alchemists who claimed to know the secrets of immortality, but none could satisfy him. Finally, he heard of a reclusive and powerful sage who lived deep in the mountains west of Luoyang. This sage was said to possess the elixir of life and the secrets of transcendence.\n\nDetermined to find this sage, Wang Xizhi set out on a journey through the rugged terrain of western China. He braved fierce winds, treacherous cliffs, and wild animals, but eventually arrived at the foot of the mountain where the sage was said to reside. There he encountered a young hermit who told him that the sage was indeed nearby, but could only be reached through a perilous path over a cliff.\n\nUndaunted, Wang Xizhi climbed the cliff and finally reached the summit where the sage awaited him. The sage was an ancient and mysterious figure, with a long white beard and piercing eyes that seemed to penetrate the very soul. He welcomed Wang Xizhi and asked him why he sought immortality.\n\nWang Xizhi replied that he wished to continue his art and perfect it for all eternity. The sage nodded and said that he could grant Wang Xizhi's wish, but it would require a great sacrifice. Wang Xizhi agreed to whatever was required and the sage gave him a small pill, telling him to swallow it and not to reveal its contents to anyone.\n\nWang Xizhi did as he was told and immediately felt a surge of energy and enlightenment course through his body. He felt himself being lifted up into the air and then soaring higher and higher until he saw the whole world spread out before him like a map. He saw mountains and rivers, cities and villages, forests and deserts, and all of humanity going about their daily lives.\n\nThen he heard a voice calling him back down to earth. It was the sage, who told him that his time had come to an end. Wang Xizhi was filled with dread and begged the sage to let him stay a little longer, but the sage said it was impossible. He told Wang Xizhi to return to his mortal body and continue his calligraphy, but warned him that if he revealed the secret of the pill, he would be doomed to a life of misery and suffering.\n\nWang Xizhi returned to his body and immediately felt the weight of his mortal existence once again. He knew that what he had experienced was not a dream or a hallucination, but a genuine encounter with the divine. He resumed his calligraphy with renewed vigor and skill, producing some of his most famous works during the final years of his life.\n\nThe story of Wang Xizhi and the Sage of Calligraphy became a popular folktale in China, inspiring generations of artists and seekers to pursue transcendence and perfection.

The voice told him that if he could unlock the secrets of the toad, he would gain access to a treasure trove of cosmic knowledge and power.\n\nWithout hesitation, Liu Hai set out to decipher the toad's secrets.

The four Classics of Chinese Medicine, which are Huangdi Neijing (Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic), Shanghan Lun (Treatise on Cold Damage Disorders), Jingui Yaolue (Essential Prescriptions from the Golden Cabinet), and Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing (Shen Nong's Materia Medica), were compiled based on the knowledge and insights of the earlier generations, including the medical documents of the Han Tombs.\n\nThe medical documents in the Han Tombs provided valuable information on acupuncture, moxibustion, herbal medicine, and medical diagnosis, which laid the foundation for the development of Chinese medicine. The four Classics, especially Huangdi Neijing, further systematized and refined the theories and practices of Chinese medicine, and became the fundamental texts of the field.\n\nTherefore, the medical documents of Han Tombs were an important part of the historical source of Chinese medicine, and the ideas, theories, and practices recorded in these documents have a profound impact on the subsequent development of Chinese medicine, including the four Classics."}]}, {"facetValue": "provide information about the chronological order of Chinese ceramic developments.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "understand the chronological order of the development of different types of Chinese ceramics, including key details about each period and specific types of ceramics mentioned."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "provide information about the chronological order of Chinese ceramic developments."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "\u300a\u4e2d\u56fd\u7f8e\u672f\u53f2\u8bb2\u5ea7\u300b\u7b2c\u516d\u8bb2\u4e2d\u5143\u4ee3\u5728\u74f7\u5668\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u4e0a\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u9664\u4e86\u8131\u80ce\u74f7\u5668\u7684\u5960\u57fa\u8fd8\u5305\u62ec\u54ea\u4e2a"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u65b9\u9762\uff1f\n\n\u9664\u4e86\u8131\u80ce\u74f7\u5668\u7684\u5960\u57fa\u5916\uff0c\u5143\u4ee3\u5728\u74f7\u5668\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u4e0a\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u8fd8\u5305\u62ec\u91c9\u4e0b\u5f69\u74f7\u5668\u7684\u5f00\u521b\u3002\u91c9\u4e0b\u5f69\u74f7\u5668\u662f\u5229\u7528\u5236\u6210\u7684\u74f7\u5668\u672c\u8eab\u5438\u6536\u989c\u6599\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6b21\u70e7\u5236\u5236\u6210\u5177\u6709\u5f69\u8272\u56fe\u6848\u7684\u74f7\u5668\uff0c\u5176\u5236\u4f5c\u6280\u672f\u6781\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b21\u65bd\u91c9\u548c\u70e7\u5236\u6765\u5b8c\u6210\u3002\u5143\u4ee3\u7684\u91c9\u4e0b\u5f69\u74f7\u5668\u8d28\u5730\u6d01\u767d\uff0c\u91c9\u8272\u7eda\u4e3d\u660e\u4e3d\uff0c\u7eb9\u9970\u591a\u6837\uff0c\u8fdc\u80dc\u5b8b\u3001\u660e\u4e24\u4ee3\uff0c\u88ab\u8a89\u4e3a\u201c\u5143\u5f69\u201d\u3002 "}, {"role": "user", "content": "\u4ece\u53f2\u524d\u7684\u7b80\u964b\u9676\u5668\u7b97\u8d77\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684\u9676\u74f7\u53d1\u5c55\u7ecf\u5386\u4e86\u4ee5\u4e0b\u987a\u5e8f"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4ece\u53f2\u524d\u7684\u7b80\u964b\u9676\u5668\u7b97\u8d77\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684\u9676\u74f7\u53d1\u5c55\u7ecf\u5386\u4e86\u4ee5\u4e0b\u987a\u5e8f:\n\n1. \u65b0\u77f3\u5668\u65f6\u4ee3\u665a\u671f -
