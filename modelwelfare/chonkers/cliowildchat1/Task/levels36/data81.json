Using metallic materials leads to a better performance in terms of time,\nenvironment, and business flexibility, while plastic materials have a better cost\nperformance and ceramic materials have a better quality performance.\nHowever, it is hard to generalize from these findings and comment on the future\nof the technology since every day we see technological advances in equipment and\nmaterials. In addition, every day we also see the successful application of AM in\nnew sectors. Therefore, most of these findings are only relevant to the current status\nof AM technology.\n6.3 Economic Analysis\nIn order to understand the size of cost-effective production volume, break-even\npoints can be considered as a useful measure. This measure is generally used to\ndetermine when a business will be able to cover all its expenses and begin to make a\nprofit. In this case, the break-even points tell us the maximum size of production\nvolumes below which AM technologies represent a more cost-effective manufacturing process compared to conventional manufacturing. However, the break-even\npoint of production is case-specific, depending on technological aspects such as part\ncomplexity, material and build volume.\nIn an early attempt to compare the cost per part of additive and conventional\nprocesses, Hopkinson and Dickens (2003) studied SLS (additive) and injection\nmolding (conventional). The curve of injection molding (Fig. 6.12) clearly shows\ncost-effective production at larger volumes because the initial costs (for instance of\nthe mold) are amortized across the production, whereas the cost per part for the\nadditive process remains constant from a single production to a larger production.\nFig. 6.12 Break-even analysis comparing laser sintering with injection molding. Source\nHopkinson and Dickens 2003\n182 6 Strategic Alignment of Additive Manufacturing\nHowever, they studied the RM application of additive processes, which is the\nproduction of copies of the same product.\nRuffo et al. (2006) overcame the limitations of the previous study, by considering further components of the cost of production such as labor, materials,\nmachine, and administrative overheads. In contrast to the last study, the new\nanalysis has a curve with a saw-tooth shape to the filling of the machine bed space\n(Fig. 6.13). It also shows the higher cost per part for single or lower production\nvolumes due to the initial costs of setting up. The break-even point moved from\n14,000 parts in the previous study of 2003\u20139000 parts in the current study, thanks\nto the newly developed cost estimation model.\nThen, Ruffo and Hague (in 2007) looked at the capability of AM technologies in\nthe simultaneous production of different components, which may affect the cost per\npart at lower production volumes. In other words, as seen in Fig. 6.14, the study\ncompared the production of copies of the same parts and parallel printing of mixed\ncomponents, both with an SLS system. The results demonstrate the efficient operational costs when simultaneously printing mixed components. The optimized mixing\nof the components in the building platform also results in further cost savings.\nThe previously mentioned experiments considered objects that were additively\nmanufactured with plastic materials. So, for parts made of plastic, the results\ndemonstrate that the competitiveness of AM in comparison with conventional\nmanufacturing is well established. However, when considering the design optimization offered by AM, more cost effective operation can be expected as previous\nstudies did not consider the possible optimization, and the design file was that used\nin conventional manufacturing. The potential design optimization comes from the\nFig. 6.13 Comparing cost models of laser sintering and injection molding. Source Ruffo et al.\n2006\n6.3 Economic Analysis 183\nfreedom of design to produce lightweight parts, complex structures, integrated\nparts, hierarchical structures, and so on.\nAs discussed in Chap. 5, designers and engineers should consider the following\nitems if they are to achieve an optimum design with AM (Gibson et al. 2010):\n\u2022 The possibility of using undercuts, flexible wall thickness and deeper channels\n\u2022 The possibility of fabricating parts with unlimited complexity such as twisted\nshapes, blind holes, and screw forms\n\u2022 The possibility of combining several components into an integrated assembly.\nWith these aspects in mind, in an effort to evaluate the efficiency of AM production of metal parts, Atzeni and Salmi (2012) conducted an analysis involving the\ncomparison of the SLS of an additive process with high-pressure die-casting in a\nconventional process, to look at possible design optimization. They employed an\nEOSINT M270 machine (from EOS GmbH) and direct metal laser sintering (DMLS).\nThe sample part, an aeronautic component, (Fig. 6.15a) is the main landing gear of\nthe Italian P180 Avant II aircraft, built by Piaggio Aero Industries S.p.A. The\nredesigned part (Fig. 6.15b) benefits from a reduction in the number of components\nthat need assembling and a reduction of as much as possible in material usage through\nthe use of undercuts and hollow structures, and a design for optimum functionality.\nThe cost components usually include materials, processing and tooling.\nProcessing costs consist of machine amortization, design and testing, labor, and\nboth pre- and post-processing. Tooling cost is only considered for traditional\nmanufacturing, for instance with high-pressure die-casting the cost of an object\nconsists of four main components\u2014the cost of materials, the cost of the mold, the\ncost of the process and post-processing per part. Likewise, the cost of an\nSLS-printed part also contains four components: pre-processing, material, processing, and post-processing. The details of the cost per part in both high-pressure\ndie-casting and SLS processes are presented respectively in Tables 6.4 and 6.5.\nFig. 6.14 Comparing cost models of copies of single products and mixed components. Source\nRuffo and Hague 2007\n184 6 Strategic Alignment of Additive Manufacturing\nFurthermore, for the former, an assembly operation is required and the cost of the\nassembly is calculated at the end, based on the production volume (N).\nBased on the results obtained and the cost model, Fig. 6.16 illustrates the\nbreak-even curves when comparing an SLS additive process with a conventional\nhigh-pressure die-cast method for a part made of aluminum alloy. Specifically, SLS can\nbe considered as an efficient manufacturing method when the production volume is\nlower than forty-two assembly components. However, the observed justifications were\nmore than just the economic aspects. For instance, the total process in the SLS method\ntook only 2.5 days, while pre-processing (such as mold production) took several weeks\nin the conventional process, contributing in a reduction of time to market.\nTable 6.6 shows the results of some other case studies that attempted to find the\nmaximum production volume at which AM can be cost-effective in comparison to\nconventional processes. Five case studies are presented in the table. For instance, in\nterms of metallic materials, Lindemann et al. (2012) compared selective laser\nmelting with a traditional subtractive milling process. AM can be considered as a\ncost-effective manufacturing method for this part when the production volume is\nlower than 190 in number. Broadly speaking, the maximum cost-effective production volume when using polymers for AM is higher than that for metal parts.\nIn these studies, the production time was measured experimentally in laboratories. Nevertheless, the ability to estimate the cost of production early is an\nindispensable attribute and one of the main issues in the preliminary evaluation of\nthe technology. Several studies have proposed models for estimating the build time\nand cost of products manufactured using AM technology based on artificial\nFig. 6.15 Main landing gear of the Italian aircraft P180 Avant II (a); and the redesigned part (b).\nSource Atzeni and Salmi 2012\n6.3 Economic Analysis 185\nintelligence (Di Angelo and Di Stefano 2010, 2011; Mungu\u00eda et al. 2009). Their\nproposed parametric approach analyzes the geometrical features which typically\naffect the build time of AM.\nObviously, the production cost of using AM technology is linked to the build\ntime, along with other drivers like materials. The build time depends on the characteristics of the additive systems, object geometries and complexity, and build\norientation. Build time is usually the summation of the time used for printing layers\nand the delay between layers forming. Layer printing time is the time that the tool\ntakes to create the layer contours and the tool path loops. The tool path loops\ndepend on the tool path length and the number of tool repositionings. The delay\ntime between forming layers is employed for the solidification and cooling of the\ndeposited layers.\nThe build time of additive processes usually consists of seven main components\nas follows (Di Angelo and Di Stefano 2011):\n\u2022 Scanning time of the material contour\n\u2022 Time for hatching material\nTable 6.4 Costs for high-pressure die-cast parts\nComponents Unit Amount\nProduction volume (pcs) N\nMaterial cost per kg (EUR/kg) 16.00\nPart weight (kg) (kg) 0.162\nMaterial cost per part (EUR) 2.59\nStandard components\u2019 cost (EUR) 1900\nMold cavities and slides cost (EUR) 15,400\nAncillary cost (EUR) 3700\nMold cost per part (EUR) 21,000/N\nMachine cost per hour (EUR/h) 260.00\nCycle time (h) 0.001\nLabor cost per hour processing (EUR/h) 35.00\nPercentage of operator time (%) 10%\nProcessing cost per part (EUR) 0.26\nHeat treatment cost per part (EUR) 1.42\nMachining operations cost (EUR) 13.98\nLabor cost per hour post-processing (EUR/h) 25.00\nOperator time (h) 0.100\nPost-processing cost per part (EUR) 17.90\nTotal cost per part (EUR) 20.75 + 21,000/N\nLinkages parts\u2019 costs (EUR) 0.50\nAssembly cost (EUR) 0.04\nTotal cost per assembly (EUR) 21.29 + 21,000/N\nSource Atzeni and Salmi 2012\nItalics the cost per part\n186 6 Strategic Alignment of Additive Manufacturing\n\u2022 Scanning time of the supports\u2019 contours\n\u2022 Time for hatching supports\n\u2022 Repositioning time of deposition tool\n\u2022 Repositioning time of the supports\u2019 deposition tool\n\u2022 Delay time between deposition of subsequent layers.\nFig. 6.16 Break-even analysis comparing conventional HPDC process with SLS.

For instance, as seen in\nTable 6.7 the sub-process involved in typical commercial AM technologies, which\nare the driving factors of processing time.\nIn parametric build time estimation, driving factors play an important role in the\nprocess. These factors can be identified through the STL standard definition of the\ngeometric model. Eight parameters (Vmat=Lmat,\nbzmat=Lmat ,pmat; nrmat , Vsup=Lsup,\nbzsup=Lsup, psup, nrsup) consider the dimensional features of the object and the\ndimensional technological parameters.\nwhere:\nVmat Volume of material to be printed; Vsup (for support)\nLmat Layer thickness; Lsup (for support)\nbz\u2212mat Object\u2019s height; bz\u2212sup (for support)\npmat Total length of the layers\u2019 contour to be deposited; psup (for support)\nnr\u2212mat The number of repositioning movements; nr\u2212sup (for support).\n188 6 Strategic Alignment of Additive Manufacturing\nUsing the above-mentioned estimation model, companies can estimate the build\ntime and can then estimate the production cost of a part with AM. Therefore, they can\nsee whether or not the AM technologies are cost-effective when compared with the\nexisting manufacturing methods in the initial stages of implementing the technology.\nExhibit 14\u2014Economical Analysis\u2014Return On Investment\nReturn on investment (ROI) takes into account the gain or loss generated on\nan investment relative to the amount of money invested. It allows one to\ncompare the efficiency of different investments. Therefore, one parameter for\ncomparing AM with conventional manufacturing is to know the profitability\nof any investment. Studies and practitioners confirm the benefits of AM\ntechnology in terms of production and business opportunities, because since\nAM enables toolless production and needs a smaller production line, it can\nreduce operational costs. AM may offer a much better investment opportunity\nin comparison with conventional manufacturing, particularly for high-value\nparts with low-volume production.\nMore than 43% of the respondents believe that AM is not good for profitability of investment. This may be due to the higher initial investment in\nequipment in some circumstances such as the production of parts made of\nmetal or those with a need for greater precision. AM machineries have to\nfully consider this performance indicator so as to reduce the amount of\ninvestment required by as much as possible. Notably, AM adopters can also\nthink of creating new business with those assets and/or should consider how\nto take full advantage of the technology\u2019s potential.\n6.3 Economic Analysis 189\nSeven Key Facts\n\u2022 AM can drive competitiveness for developed countries because it needs\nfewer resources.\n\u2022 AM is more advantageous for small and medium enterprises because of\ntheir flexibility.\n\u2022 AM is an efficient manufacturing method for small to medium production\nvolumes.\n\u2022 AM is an effective manufacturing method for parts with complex shapes,\ncustomization requirements, and creative designs.\n\u2022 The operational performance using AM for prototyping is more efficient\nthan manufacturing end-usable products.\n\u2022 The operational performance when using AM for small-size products is\nmore efficient than large ones.\n\u2022 Approximately 57% of AM adopters believe that AM is better than\nconventional manufacturing in terms of profitability of investment.\n\nAM technologies are beginning to move beyond a common set of basic process\nsteps. In the future we will likely see more processes using variations of the\nconventional AM approach, and combinations of AM with conventional\nmanufacturing operations. Some technologies are being developed to process\nregions rather than layers of a part. As a result, more intelligent and complex\nsoftware systems will be required to effectively deal with segmentation.\nWe can expect processes to become more complex within a single machine. We\nalready see numerous additive processes combined with subtractive elements. As\ntechnology develops further, we may see commercialization of hybrid technologies\nthat include additive, subtractive, and even robotic handling phases in a complex\ncoordinated and controlled fashion. This will require much more attention to\nsoftware descriptions, but may also lead to highly optimized parts with multiple\nfunctionality and vastly improved quality with very little manual intervention\nduring the actual build process.\nAnother trend we are likely to see is the development of customized AM\nsystems. Presently, AM machines are designed to produce as wide a variety of\npossible part geometries with as wide a range of materials as possible. Reduction of\nthese variables may result in machines that are designed only to build a subset of\nparts or materials very efficiently or inexpensively. This has already started with the\nproliferation of \u201cpersonal\u201d versus \u201cindustrial\u201d material extrusion systems. In addition, many machines are being targeted for the dental or hearing aid markets, and\nsystem manufacturers have redesigned their basic machine architectures and/or\nsoftware tools to enable rapid setup, building, and post-processing of patient specific small parts.\nSoftware is increasingly being optimized specifically for AM processing. Special software has been designed to increase the efficiency of hearing aid design and\nmanufacture. There is also special software designed to convert the designs of\nWorld of Warcraft models into \u201cFigurePrints\u201d (see Fig. 3.3) as well as specially\ndesigned post-processing techniques [3]. As Direct Digital Manufacturing becomes\nmore common, we will see the need to develop standardized software processes\nbased around AM, so that we can better control, track, regulate, and predict the\nmanufacturing process."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The advantages and disadvantages of additive manufacturing for Industry 4.0 are as follows:\n\nAdvantages:\n1.

One key advantage is time efficiency; AM can significantly reduce production time, particularly for small to medium-sized production volumes and components with complex geometries. Furthermore, AM technologies require fewer resources compared to conventional manufacturing, making them more competitive for developed countries and small and medium enterprises. This also enhances business flexibility, as tool-less production and smaller production lines help decrease operational costs.\n\nAM is especially suited for customization, making it possible to tailor each part or batch without substantially affecting production time or cost. Alongside this, the technology provides unparalleled freedom of design, allowing the creation of lightweight parts, complex structures, integrated parts, and hierarchical structures. Additionally, smaller product sizes can improve environmental performance, contributing to more sustainable manufacturing processes.\n\nDespite these benefits, there are some challenges and drawbacks to consider. For larger product sizes, AM can deliver better quality, but current technology may struggle to meet quality requirements in certain applications. Material limitations can also impose restrictions on performance; while metallic materials result in better overall performance, plastic materials demonstrate superior cost-performance and ceramic materials provide improved quality performance.\n\nAnother disadvantage is the break-even point. The cost-effectiveness of AM compared to conventional manufacturing largely depends on production volumes and part complexity. In high-volume production, conventional manufacturing methods might still be more cost-effective. Moreover, the initial investment required for AM machinery might be prohibitive for smaller companies or those seeking higher returns on investment (ROI).\n\nAs AM technology develops, the associated software and processes will likely grow more complex.

Such advancements will necessitate more sophisticated software solutions but may also lead to highly optimized components with multiple functionalities and vastly improved quality, with minimal manual intervention during the build process.\n\nIn conclusion, additive manufacturing offers a range of advantages for Industry 4.0, such as time efficiency, reduced resources, customization capabilities, and design optimization. However, there are some limitations, including quality restrictions, material constraints, break-even points, and initial investment costs.

Production was primarily based on manual labor or small-scale tools.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution changed this in several ways:\n\n1. Shift from agriculture to industry: With increased mechanization and technology, the focus shifted from agriculture to the production of goods in factories. Textile production saw the application of new innovations such as the spinning jenny and power loom, making the manufacturing process much faster and more efficient. This led to increased production and lower costs.\n\n2. Expansion of iron and coal industries: The iron and coal industries expanded significantly during the Industrial Revolution, leading to greater availability of raw materials for manufacturing. Iron production increased thanks to innovations such as the blast furnace and the puddling process, while the steam engine's application improved coal extraction.\n\n3. Urbanization: As factories flourished, people flocked to urban areas searching for work. The population of cities grew rapidly, leading to the development of housing, transportation, and public services. The rapid migration of people from rural to urban areas had both positive and negative impacts, leading to overcrowding and social struggles but also creating a new class structure with distinct roles for factory owners, workers, and merchants.\n\n4. Development of railroads and transportation: The invention of the steam engine and its application in transportation paved the way for the development of railways. The expansion of railway systems connected cities and rural areas, allowing for faster transport of people and goods. This also allowed businesses to expand, leading to increased trade between different regions and countries.\n\n5. Improvements in communication: The Industrial Revolution also spurred advancements in communication, with the invention of the telegraph and the telephone allowing for faster and more efficient communication across long distances.\n\n6. Global trade and imperialism: With increased production and the ability to transport goods across the globe, international trade flourished. European nations engaged in imperialism, exploiting the resources of colonies in Asia, Africa, and other regions to fuel their industrial economies.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution was a time of significant social and economic change, leading to improvements in the standard of living, shifts in labor and employment, and the evolution of the global economy.

For a reinforced concrete wall subjected to axial load, bending moment, and shear force, the nominal capacity of the wall should be multiplied by a load factor of 0.90 for strength design and increased to account for the effects of accidental eccentricity, as follows:\n- \u03c6P_n_eff = 0.90 x 1.6 x \u03c6P_n_eff = 0.90 x 1.6 x 378 kips = 683 kips\n- \u03c6M_n_eff = 0.90 x 1.2 x \u03c6M_n_eff = 0.90 x 1.2 x 1030 kip-ft = 1112 kip-ft\n\n- The load combination check requires that the applied loads be factored by appropriate load factors and compared to the adjusted capacities of the wall. For this example, we assume the following load factors:\n- \u03c6P = 0.75 for axial load\n- \u03c6M = 0.90 for bending moment\n- \u03c6V = 0.75 for shear force\n\n- Plugging in the numbers, we get:\n- \u03c6P_n\u03c6P = 0.75 x 25 kips = 18.8 kips\n- \u03c6M_n\u03c6M = 0.90 x 10 kip-ft = 9 kips\n- \u03c6V_c\u03c6V = 0.75 x 5 kips = 3.8 kips\n\n- The total factored load is 18.8 kips + 9 kips + 3.8 kips = 31.6 kips\n- The adjusted capacities of the wall are 683 kips for axial load and 1112 kip-ft for bending moment.\n- The adjusted capacities are greater than the factored load, so the wall is considered safe for the given loads."}, {"role": "user", "content": "please the same calculation above in metric unit"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure!
