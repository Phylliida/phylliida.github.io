PaymentsPharmacies buying on other platforms are required to have an independent relationship with each supplier. Suppliers invoice pharmacies by paper each month and pharmacies need to make a manual payment to the wholesalers. Pharmacies are required to keep track of each open balance with each supplier, make sure there is no credit overage and make check payments by mail or over the phone. With EzriRx.com, pharmacies can manage their credit limits with each supplier, make online payments and never have to deal with paper invoices again.  2. User ExperienceEzriRx.com was built with state of the art technology and provides an enhanced user experience to make it super simple to use from a search perspective and operations perspective. EzriRx provides images for each product along with WAC, Price Per Pill and Drug information for each product. Additionally, pharmacies can sort by short dated products to add to their cart and hit their shipping minimums. 3. Different Wholesalers and better pricing\n\nSoon pharmacies will be able to purchase on EzriRx.com toward their contracts with primaries. But at the moment, while EzriRx.com has similar wholesalers as other portals, we also have different suppliers they don\u2019t have that offer even better pricing than what they are currently getting. 4. Customer ServiceOther portals require pharmacies to be on their own, but with EzriRx.com we offer a full suite of customer service solutions to each pharmacy for free. If a pharmacy can\u2019t find a drug, they can message us at any time and we will go above and beyond to find them that product at the best price. Even if it means we will lose money. Customers always come first.  5. Daily DealsCurated deals are available on the pharmacies home page dashboard each day that are tailored specifically for them. These deals rotate every few days and pharmacies are able to purchase these items with one-click purchasing. 6. Best OffersOur latest and most advanced feature yet - and a feature no other portal has - is the Best Offers feature, which allows pharmacies to haggle with wholesalers directly through the platform. Pharmacies can see the base price and make an offer for a better deal with a supplier, adding to their increased savings\n\n# Social Media Strategy for Ezrirx\n\n## Objectives\n\n1.

The PESTEL analysis refers to the evaluation of factors such as Political, Economic, Sociocultural, Technological, Environmental, and Legal factors that potentially influence an industry. Regarding the Microsoft Gaming Division, several factors have influenced the demand for the company's products and services, such as the Xbox consoles, gaming software, and related online services. This essay will explore these key factors and their influence on the demand for Microsoft Gaming Division in the context of the general market of the industry.\n\nPolitical factors play a significant role in the demand for Microsoft's gaming division products. With the company operating in diverse geographical locations, it faces different political and regulatory environments (Parnell & Elrod, 2018). Changes in government policies, taxation or trade relations, and subsidies given to local competitors can potentially impact Microsoft's operations globally. For instance, regulations related to gaming practices or content censorship in certain countries like China can hinder the growth of Microsoft's gaming division.\n\nThe economic factors, such as the global economic outlook, disposable income, and consumer spending, directly impact the gaming industry. Economic growth and high employment rates often result in higher consumer spending on games and entertainment, leading to increased demand for Microsoft's gaming products (Pendyala et al., 2017). However, conversely, economic downturns or recessions might prompt consumers to cut back on non-essential expenses, which could adversely affect the demand for gaming products and services.\n\nSociocultural factors also influence the demand for Microsoft's gaming division products. With a growing global interest in competitive e-sports and gaming as a form of entertainment, the popularity of gaming consoles and games has increased (Jenny et al., 2017). This has, in turn, positively affected the Microsoft Gaming Division's demand. Moreover, the increasing appeal of online and multiplayer gaming experiences supported by robust platforms like Xbox Live has contributed to Microsoft's gaming products' growing demand.\n\nTechnological factors have been particularly influential in the gaming industry, with rapid advancements in technology leading to innovative gaming products and experiences (Chen & Huang, 2016). Microsoft has effectively capitalized on these advancements to deliver high-quality and immersive gaming experiences through its Xbox console series, cloud gaming services, and exclusive game titles. Technologies such as virtual reality, cloud-based gaming, and artificial intelligence have the potential to significantly alter the gaming landscape and further influence the demand for Microsoft's gaming division offerings.\n\nEnvironmental factors have also become increasingly significant for businesses, with a growing emphasis on sustainability and reducing the environmental impact of products and operations. Microsoft has committed to carbon emission reduction and sustainable practices (Microsoft, 2020), which solidifies its reputation as a responsible corporate citizen. Demonstrating environmental consciousness might enhance its position in the market and result in increased demand for its products.\n\nLegal factors, such as intellectual property rights and GDPR regulations, affect the gaming industry (Hamilton et al., 2017). Strict adherence to these regulations can ensure smooth operations for Microsoft's gaming division, foster innovation, and protect their games and technology from illegal distribution or plagiarism.\n\nIn conclusion, the PESTEL analysis indicates that numerous macro-environmental factors have influenced the demand for Microsoft Gaming Division products and services. These factors include political aspects like government policies and regulations, economic factors such as global economic growth and disposable income, sociocultural influences like the rising interest in gaming and e-sports, technological advancements driving innovation, environmental concerns, and adherence to legal factors such as GDPR regulations and intellectual property rights.\n\nReferences:\n\nChen, S., & Huang, T.

In examining the factors that influence its demand, we must look at the Political, Economic, Sociocultural, Technological, Environmental, and Legal aspects of the industry (Li, 2018). This essay explores the key factors within each aspect of the PESTEL framework and their impact on the Microsoft Gaming Division in the context of the general market of the industry.\n\nPolitical factors have a significant influence on the demand for Microsoft's gaming division products. As a global company, Microsoft operates in various regions and is subject to different government policies, regulations, and taxation schemes (Parnell & Elrod, 2018). For instance, changes in import tariffs, trade agreements, or subsidies for local competitors can create challenging political environments, which could impact the growth and demand for Microsoft's gaming products.\n\nEconomic factors are vital in determining the demand for Microsoft's gaming products. Consumer spending habits and disposable income largely depend on the global economic climate (Pendyala et al., 2017). During periods of economic growth, disposable income increases, leading to higher spending on non-essential items such as gaming consoles and games. Conversely, economic downturns can negatively affect consumer spending, and thus demand for gaming products may decrease.\n\nSociocultural factors significantly impact the demand for gaming products and services. For instance, sociocultural trends such as the growing popularity of esports and the increasing acceptance of gaming as an entertainment medium have been favorable for Microsoft's gaming division (Jenny et al., 2017). Additionally, the focus on bringing diverse and inclusive gaming content and experiences to appeal to a broader audience has contributed positively to the demand for Microsoft's gaming products.\n\nTechnological advancements have been a significant driving force behind the evolution of the gaming industry. The rapid development of new technologies, such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and cloud-based gaming, has facilitated the emergence of innovative gaming experiences (Chen & Huang, 2016).

Return to the Isle of Macaroon at the end of the thirty days to weigh your money against Glomgold's. May the better duck win!\n\nScrooge's Office: The game begins at Scrooge's office.\n\nInvestments: Help Scrooge score big in the stock market. Look up the stock's chart in the Junior Woodchuck Guide and find out if it is selling for a low or high price. Choose \"RETURN TO OFFICE\" from the company list when you are finished making your investments.\n\nMoney Bin: Take a dive into Scrooge's Money Bin. If you're lucky, you may find a rare coin.\n\nControl Center: The first time you use the Control Center, a secret message will appear. Use Gyro's Secret Code from the Junior Woodchuck Guide to decode the message. You will then see Scrooge's World Map.\n\nWorld Map: You can only go to a location where neither you nor Glomgold has found the treasure.\n\nLaunchpad's Airplane: When Glomgold races against you to the same destination, his airplane will appear in the sky. Stay away from clouds and other objects that send you in the wrong direction. If you bounce off the ground too many times, it will cost you time and money. Try to safely reach the hangar at the end of your trip.\n\nMountain Climbing: Watch out for falling objects and ledges holding enemies such as the Beagle Boys. Caves can help you travel quickly through the mountain, but stay away from caves having eyes. Animals will come out and knock you down. If you fall too far, that nephew will be unable to go on.\n\nJungle Survival: Use swinging vines and springy branches to reach distant trees. Cross rivers by hopping across the heads of floating animals, but avoid all other animals. If you fall or sink, that nephew will be unable to go on.\n\nCave Exploring: All caves are laid out diagonally so the pathways crisscross like an X. Your map shows the cave as a maze. Depending on the difficulty level, it will also show your location, the location of slime caves, the mummy and the treasures. Your location (Scrooge) is represented by a blue dot, slime caverns are green dots, the mummy is a blue dot and the treasure is a yellow dot.\n\nPhoto Safari: Don't waste your film on photographs of ordinary animals; your camera has only twelve shots. Look in the Junior Woodchuck Guide to find pictures of the rare animals.\n\nThe Scales of Macaroon: Travel to Macaroon to deposit your gold safely and compare it against Glomgold's.

He has prospected for platinum in Peru, sold snowcones in the Sahara, and built big businesses from Burbank to Bora Bora. The result -- three cubic acres of cash that he keeps in his Money Bin. To Scrooge, the Money Bin represents challenges met and obstacles overcome. \"I made it by being tougher and the toughies, and smarter than the smarties,\" he boasts.\n\nFenton Crackshell, Investment Advisor -- Formerly Chief Bean Counter at the Duckburg Bean Factory, Fenton is now Scrooge's accountant. Scrooge values Fenton's ability to count faster than the speed of sound, although Fenton's judgement is not always very sound. (Fenton once dumped all of Scrooge's cash into Lake Doughbegone, hoping to turn it into liquid assets.)\n\nGyro Gearloose, Science Advisor - One of the world's foremost inventors, Gyro has invented such useful devices as the hydraulic toothpick, portable skyscraper and megawatter pogostick. He now sets up shop in his \"Brainstorming Barn\", where he dedicates his life to finding complex solutions to simple problems.\n\nLaunchpad McQuack, Aviation Advisor - Launchpad is Scrooge's personal pilot. His dashing self-confidence and gung-ho attitude give him a gift with any vehicle from a Martian space fighter to a Mongolian shopping cart. Launchpad's many flying records include Most Crashes per Year, Shortest Flight on Record, and Most Barns Stormed. He was recently awarded the prestigious \"Cooked Goose\" trophy, presented to \"the flyer most likely to use his parachute.\"\n\nJUNIOR ADVISORY PANEL\n\nContributing to the Junior Woodchuck Guide is the highest honor that a Junior Woodchuck can earn. For this edition, four youngsters have been chosen for their outstanding contributions to the art and craft of Woodchucking.\n\nHuey, Mountaineering Merit Badge Holder -- Scrooge's nephew Huey earned his merit badge by making the fastest recorded climb up Mount Howling Peak: 4 hours and 26 minutes (he was being chased by a Wham Ram at the time).\n\nDewey, Jungle Survival Merit Badge Holder -- Dewey earned his Merit Badge by rescuing a Junior Woodchuck troop lost in the Amazon for nine weeks. Dewey's advice to Troop leader Doofus: \"Never keep your compass and your magnet in the same pocket!\"\n\nLouie, Spelunking Merit Badge Holder -- Louie earned his merit badge exploring caves in China with his uncle, Scrooge McDuck. In a forgotten cavern he discovered the earliest known cave paintings, the work of the ancient \"Peking Duck\". Louie reported, \"Well, I don't know if it's art, but I know what I like!\"\n\nWebby, Wildlife Photography Merit Badge Holder -- Webby's special way with wild animals got her the photographs that earned her this merit badge. Her ability to handle wild animals often comes in handy on adventures with Scrooge McDuck. After all, she has to put up with Scrooge's nephews!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The text introduces the Junior Woodchuck Board of Advisors and Junior Advisory Panel, which consist of characters who contribute their expertise to help Junior Woodchucks in the game.

The purpose of this business is to promote the use of bran oil as a healthy and nutritious segment of the Malaysian food industry, providing customers with quality and value for their money. This business plan outlines the target market, marketing strategy, financial projections, and operations required to establish and scale a successful bran oil production company. We request your support by providing a startup grant to facilitate the business operations.\n\nExecutive Summary:\n\n[Your Company Name] is a bran oil production startup company with a mission to produce and supply high-quality, cost-effective, and health-conscious products for consumers in Malaysia. Our primary focus will be on extracting and processing bran oil for distribution to the local market. As a rich source of antioxidants, vitamins, and heart-healthy fats, we believe that bran oil plays a crucial role in maintaining a well-balanced diet for Malaysians.\n\nMarket Analysis:\n\nAs healthy living awareness continues to grow in Malaysia, consumers have started seeking products that offer health benefits while remaining cost-effective. With the local market dominated by imported brands, there is a considerable opportunity for a local bran oil producer to capture a share in the market. Malaysia's consumption of edible oil has been growing steadily over the years, providing an ever-increasing customer base for our products.\n\nProduct and Services:\n\nOur company will primarily invest in the procurement and processing of bran oil. The oil acquired will undergo quality control and assurance measures including laboratory testing and refining to ensure the highest quality product. Along with bran oil, we also plan to utilize the byproducts from the manufacturing process, such as rice bran meal, for animal feed production to increase efficiency and profitability.\n\nMarketing Strategy:\n\nOur marketing strategy primarily involves targeting health-conscious consumer segments through a mix of online and offline marketing channels. By promoting the nutritional value and health benefits of our bran oil, we will position our products as a premium choice for the Malaysian market.\n\nTo ensure maximum outreach to our target market, we intend to collaborate with local retailers, supermarkets, and online platforms to facilitate the distribution of our product. We also plan on conducting workshops and educational seminars regarding the benefits of bran oil to educate our potential customers.\n\nOperational Plan:\n\nTo facilitate our bran oil production startup, we are planning to establish a fully-equipped processing plant in Sabah, Malaysia. Sabah has been strategically chosen for its proximity to raw materials and the availability of skilled labor, ensuring cost-effectiveness and operational efficiency.\n\nFinancial Projections:\n\nThe requested grant will enable us to hire qualified team members, procure necessary equipment and materials, and secure a processing facility. We expect to break even within two years of operation, and our financial projections indicate profitability and consistent growth in the following years.\n\nSafety and Environmental Standards:\n\nOur business will comply with all safety and environmental regulations, including obtaining necessary permits and licenses from the relevant authorities prior to starting operations.\n\nConclusion:\n\nInvesting in [Your Company Name]'s bran oil production startup will provide Malaysians with a high-quality, affordable, healthy oil option in the local market. Furthermore, it will support the growth of the local economy and encourage the adoption of healthier lifestyles. The financial and social advantages align with Malaysia's vision to improve the wellbeing of its citizens, making this endeavor a positive contribution to the society.\n\nWe are excited about the prospect of partnering with the Ministry of Entrepreneur and Cooperatives Development, and we are confident in our ability to successfully establish this business with your support. We look forward to your favorable response and are ready to address any additional queries or provide further clarifications.

This process is typically done by a registered dietitian or a nutrition support team. Here are the general steps involved in calculating nutritional requirements in hospitalized patients:\n\n1. Assessing the patient's nutritional status: This step involves collecting information about the patient's medical history, laboratory results, physical examination findings, and dietary habits. The dietitian may use tools such as body mass index (BMI), anthropometric measurements, and malnutrition screening tools to evaluate nutritional risk.\n\n2. Determining energy needs: Resting energy expenditure (REE) and total energy expenditure (TEE) are calculated to determine the patient's calorie needs. The Harris-Benedict equation, Mifflin-St Jeor equation, or indirect calorimetry can be used to estimate REE. TEE is calculated by multiplying REE by an activity factor and an injury/stress factor, accounting for the patient's activity level, presence of fever or physical stress, and medical condition.\n\n3. Calculating protein requirements: Protein needs vary depending on the patient's age, sex, medical condition, and degree of malnutrition. Estimations usually range from 1.0 to 2.0 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day. Illness, surgery, trauma, and other factors may increase protein requirements.\n\n4. Estimating fluid requirements: Assessing hydration status and evaluating losses from vomiting, diarrhea, or other medical conditions help determine the appropriate fluid intake for each patient. Typically, fluid requirements range from 25 to 35 milliliters per kilogram of body weight, but can vary based on patient-specific factors.\n\n5. Assessing micronutrient needs: Vitamin and mineral requirements are generally met through adequate intake of energy and protein. Supplemental micronutrients may be needed in patients with specific deficiencies, malabsorption issues, or increased needs due to medical conditions.\n\n6. Developing a nutrition care plan: Based on the calculated nutritional requirements, dietitians create a personalized nutrition plan for the patient. This plan may involve enteral (tube feeding) or parenteral (intravenous) nutrition support if oral intake is not possible or insufficient.\n\n7. Regular monitoring and reassessment: The patient's nutritional status, tolerance to the prescribed nutrition support, and changes in clinical condition are regularly monitored to make adjustments to the nutrition care plan as needed. This is important to ensure that the patient receives optimal nutrition therapy during their hospital stay.\n\nIt's important to note that each patient is different, and their nutritional requirements may change as their condition improves or worsens. Regular monitoring and collaboration with the healthcare team ensures that the patient receives the best nutrition support for their individual needs."}]}, {"facetValue": "help the user summarize and understand an academic study on food portion size estimation.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "help summarize and understand an academic article on estimating food portion sizes."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "help the user summarize and understand an academic study on food portion size estimation."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "\u4f60\u597d \u8bf7\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e00\u4e0b\u4f60\u81ea\u5df1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u60a8\u597d\uff0c\u6211\u662f\u4e00\u540d\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u804c\u8d23\u662f\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u6d41\u7545\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002\u6211\u4f7f\u7528\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u56de\u7b54\u5404\u79cd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u5404\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u5b66\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6211\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e2d\u6587\u3001\u82f1\u6587\u3001\u6cd5\u8bed\u3001\u5fb7\u8bed\u7b49\u7b49\u3002\u611f\u8c22\u60a8\u4e0e\u6211\u4ea4\u6d41\uff01"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\u5e05 gpt"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u611f\u8c22\u5938\u5956\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6211\u53ea\u662f\u4e00\u53f0\u7535\u8111\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u5e05\u4e0d\u5e05\u7684\u8bf4\u6cd5\u3002\u6211\u53ea\u662f\u5c3d\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u597d\u7684\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u8ba9\u7528\u6237\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\u4f60\u77e5\u9053Mind map\u5417"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u5f53\u7136\uff0cmind map\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u56fe\u793a\u601d\u8003\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u534f\u52a9\u6211\u4eec\u6574\u7406\u5e76\u5448\u73b0\u5404\u79cd\u60f3\u6cd5\u548c\u89c2\u70b9\u3002\u5b83\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6811\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u56fe\u8868\uff0c\u7531\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e3b\u9898\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u5411\u5916\u5ef6\u4f38\u51fa\u5404\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u3001\u5b50\u4e3b\u9898\u3001\u60f3\u6cd5\u7b49\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6761\u548c\u56fe\u6807\u7b49\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u8fde\u63a5\u3002Mind map\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u6211\u4eec\u66f4\u52a0\u76f4\u89c2\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u5e38\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\u8bf7\u4f60\u5e2e\u6211\u5c06\u4e0b\u5217\u82f1\u6587\u6587\u7ae0\u7528\u82f1\u6587mind map\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u6982\u62ec"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u5f88\u62b1\u6b49\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u540d\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6211\u5e76\u4e0d\u5177\u5907\u7ed8\u5236mind map\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6211\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u60a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e9bMind map\u7684\u5236\u4f5c\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f9b\u60a8\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u81f3\u4e8e\u60a8\u6240\u63d0\u5230\u7684\u6587\u7ae0\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u613f\u610f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6587\u7ae0\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u6211\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bd5\u7740\u5e2e\u60a8\u5c06\u5176\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u6982\u62ec\u3002"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\u8bf7\u5bf9\u4e0b\u5217\u6587\u7ae0\u7528\u82f1\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6bb5\u7684\u6982\u62ec"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u5f88\u62b1\u6b49\uff0c\u6211\u5e76\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u60a8\u60f3\u8981\u6587\u672c\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u3002\u8bf7\u60a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u6587\u7ae0\uff0c\u6211\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c3d\u529b\u5e2e\u60a8\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6bb5\u6982\u62ec\u3002"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Discussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to compare individual estimates of amounts of served food with the actual weight of the food served in a laboratory setting, where less disruptive data collection techniques are applied.

In addition, the use of the Intelligent Buffet allowed the exact weight of food served by each participant to be recorded in a relatively undisturbed manner.\n\nThere are a few potential sources of bias in this study, one being measurement bias. An attempt was made to limit this by calibrating the equipment used for data collection before use and by following standard laboratory procedures. Therefore, if any measurement bias were to occur, it would be systematic throughout all observations. Secondly, the sample size may have been insufficient. However, the calculated power of 0.99 for the observed mean differences of both vegetables and whole grains suggests that the sample was enough to support the rejection of the null hypothesis. Previous studies have used a similar sample size with sufficient power (Mekhmoukh, Chapelot, & Bellisle, 2012). Thus, we assume that the result of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was accurate (absence of type II error), and that it was correct to reject the null hypothesis since there was a significant difference between the two variables \u2013 the estimated and actual amount of food served.\n\nOur findings are in agreement with similar studies conducted in a number of different countries and settings, including Norway (Uglem et al., 2008), the Netherlands (Lechner et al., 1997), Australia (Pollard et al., 2008) and Denmark (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2013), suggesting that individuals commonly have difficulties estimating food portion sizes with accuracy. The findings of a statistically significant difference between participants\u2019 self-estimation and the actual weight of the vegetables served led to the rejection of the null hypothesis (Table\u20091). The participants in this study were also asked to estimate the weight of a whole grain serving in a relatively complex meal. It would be of interest to determine whether the results would have been more accurate if a simpler meal had been served (e.g. a bowl of cereal). However, the everyday diet commonly consists of prepared meals or ready-to-eat foods and individuals are often not aware of the actual composition of the foods they consume. Therefore, serving a \u201ccomplex meal\u201d is comparable with a real life situation, where participants are expected to estimate the amount of food served (Combet et al, 2013, Loh et al, 2013).\n\nThis study presents the question of whether food intake estimations that are independent of actual weighing are valid, particularly in the evaluation of adherence to healthy eating recommendations (P\u00e9rez-Cueto et al., 2012). This also underscores the importance of using alternative equipment and techniques, such as an Intelligent Buffet, in order to obtain actual data in studies measuring factors such as food intake (Bucher et al., 2012). The Intelligent Buffet presents many opportunities to conduct other studies or further research on this particular topic. In combination with video cameras, this equipment could be used for choice architectural experiments researching behaviour related to a buffet setting. For example, it could be used to investigate whether individual consumption differs in relation to the order of food items or the size of serving trays.\n\nAs seen in Table\u20091, there is no statistical correlation between measured and estimated values; they are independent variables meaning that there is no predictive relationship between the two measurements.\n\nConsequently, if authors were to compare the difference between means they would probably find that the estimations are so different from the actual intake that they are neither reliable nor valid, thus supporting the use of alternative techniques such as the Intelligent Buffet when accuracy is a requirement of the research.\n\nGeneralizability of the findings is limited due to the study design and sample size. The use of a convenience sample from a university setting introduced a sample mainly consisting of higher educated participants aged between 20 and 29\u2009years. Consequently, the results measure perception of serving size against the weight of the food served for this survey sample. A larger sample size and a different study design would need to be undertaken to explore if these findings extrapolate to the general University student community or to specific socio-economic groups within that community. The literature and the current study findings suggest the likelihood of an overestimation of portion sizes. However, further studies should be carried out before making conclusions about whether the general population is capable of accurately estimating food portion sizes and about the effects this could have on the degree of validity in studies involving self-estimation as a data collection method.\n\nConsidering that the majority of participants were highly educated people and nevertheless unable to correctly estimate the amounts of vegetables and whole grain served, and previous research highlighting that lower socioeconomic groups may find it difficult to interpret serving size recommendations, these findings may be of concern for nutrition educators (Drewnowski, Specter, 2004, Kamp et al, 2010, Robinson, 2008, Sinclair et al, 2013). Studies show that individuals from higher socio-demographic groups have a greater knowledge and comprehension of nutrition than individuals from low socio-demographic groups (Drewnowski, Specter, 2004, Pollard et al, 2008, Sinclair et al, 2013).\n\nFurthermore, this study raises the question about whether self-estimation of portion sizes would be an appropriate way to evaluate intake of vegetables and whole grain cereals, particularly in self-serving settings, such as University Canteens, since it appears that the participants had very little ability to estimate their own intake (estimated serving vs actual serving were independent measures). Probably, this will be applicable to most other food groups, and thus this study challenges the way for instance communication towards healthy eating is delivered. It also calls for innovative ways to make the population aware of what portions are if the intention is to rely on the general ability to estimate quantities of food served or eaten.\n\nConclusion\nThe present study was the first to assess the accuracy of self-estimates of vegetables and whole grain portion sizes in a self-served meal conducted in a laboratory setting using an Intelligent Buffet combined with a quantitative questionnaire. When comparing the self-estimated amount of vegetables and whole grains with the actual amount, the analysis revealed a significant difference between the means (P\u2009<\u20090.001) where students\u2019 self-reported portions were about three times bigger than the actual servings.\n\nThe study supports the use of innovative techniques such as the Intelligent Buffet. Further it supports the use of triangulation in order to obtain more precise estimations on intake and to better evaluate the real adherence to nutritional recommendations.\n\nThe questionnaires provided information on the profile of the participants and it appeared that there was little variety within the sample. Further limitations could be linked to the sample size and the methodological approach, particularly the equipment used for the data collection and data management, which had never been utilised prior to the study.\n\nThis study suggests that at least for this survey sample individuals do not provide accurate estimates of the amount of vegetables and whole grains they serve themselves on a plate. Our study findings lead us to question individuals\u2019 ability to assess the amounts of vegetables and whole grain they serve themselves from a buffet. The degree of underestimation of servings within this small experimental group is high. On average participants assessed that they served themselves about three times what they actually did. Although there was a high awareness of the Danish 6 A Day recommendation among study participants, their ability to accurately estimate their serving size appeared to be a limited. These findings highlight the need for further research into the accuracy of self-estimated intake across the population and the implications of the overestimation of current consumption for nutrition promotion interventions.\n\nBased on the findings of this study it is recommended that policy makers and social marketing campaign creators consider the development of more specific serving size measurements or that explicit communications e.g. regarding serves of plant foods used in nutrition education are needed to assist consumers in estimating own portions sizes in relation to general health recommendations."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This article is discussing the results of a study that compares individual estimates of the amount of food served with the actual weight of the food served in a laboratory setting.

Some of the key nutritional components of flaxseed include:\n\n- Fiber: Flaxseed is high in both soluble and insoluble fiber, which can help promote digestive health, lower cholesterol levels, and reduce the risk of certain diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and colorectal cancer.\n\n- Omega-3 fatty acids: Flaxseed is one of the best plant-based sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which are important for brain function, heart health, and reducing inflammation in the body. Specifically, flaxseed contains alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a type of omega-3 fatty acid that the body can convert into EPA and DHA, the forms of omega-3s found in fatty fish.\n\n- Lignans: Flaxseed is very high in lignans, which are phytoestrogens that are thought to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. Lignans may also help regulate hormone levels and reduce the risk of breast cancer.\n\n- Protein: Flaxseed is a good source of plant-based protein, containing about 2 grams of protein per tablespoon.\n\n- Micronutrients: Flaxseed is a good source of several essential micronutrients, including magnesium, phosphorus, copper, and selenium.\n\nOverall, incorporating flaxseed into your diet can provide a number of nutritional benefits and contribute to optimal health.

However, this is still based on the premise of using animals for human consumption.\n- Even with ethical sourcing, there remains the issue of animal-derived products, such as cheese potentially containing rennet (an enzyme derived from the stomachs of slaughtered baby cows), which may not align with ethical beliefs.\n\nEnvironment:\n- Animal agriculture has a significantly higher environmental footprint compared to plant agriculture due to factors like greenhouse gas emissions, land and water usage, and deforestation.\n- While dairy and egg production might have a lower environmental impact than meat (especially beef and lamb), they still have a higher impact than plant-based alternatives. Soy or almond milk, for example, generally has a much lower environmental footprint than cow's milk.\n\nRegarding which animal-sourced dairy and eggs create the least ethical and environmental impact, one could argue that backyard hens or small-scale, carefully-managed local farms might fit that criteria.

My first task for you is:\n\ns to pass because of a lack of energy iron in the blood but this is very informative and useless because iron in the blood tends to change very actively you ate meat today you didn\u2019t eat tomorrow it has already changed Therefore, in order to assess the exchange of iron, it is still advisable to take ferritin strategic smell of iron transerin carrier protein iron to understand Can your body use this iron because it often happens that there is iron and there is no sense and of course the general binding ability to understand how all this works in the club is to the question of tests that are important to take and, accordingly, which is also useless in general again but the Miserly pay twice, yes, that is, so as not to overpay and just do the same examination where it really is necessary, maybe even some additional non-obvious analysis, it\u2019s still better through a consultation already, as it were, to take tests, they immediately take tests and then, like, go with them to a specialist As practice shows, it is more effective Because when you collected from a patient for the first consultation You understand that he represents himself You understand what he had there in the past with his parents and grandparents you understand what nuances he has anyway due to this can be done as much as possible, it\u2019s not always possible to reduce, let\u2019s say, the list of analyzes, but to do it as much as possible because sometimes such nuances are found out when you have to, on the contrary, the list of analyzes increases, but in any case, it\u2019s better to do it now and solve everything quickly than in the future, again, run retake, waste time and money and everything else is just that we actually run into such a rhetorical question comments that I also often come across, let\u2019s say I\u2019m sitting here, I hear some specific list of problems and I know that I can contact your clinic and, accordingly, I like the approach I can then receive treatment feedback at the same time, a person there conditionally from the region writes that I have an endocrinologist, if I apply, he will give me Well, that is, absolutely something else, a picture of other tests And in general, just say drink and, as it were, Come next time that is, it\u2019s like a question without an answer, that is, it\u2019s just a situation. Unfortunately, such a situation exists everywhere and we can\u2019t do anything with it except to work. But not everyone likes it. Therefore, the situation with sleep is a little bit, we switched from it, but I remember that one of the most important factors often met the story people say sleep is so important yes In order to avoid chronic fatigue And what about those who do not have a normalized schedule or especially night shifts That is, they generally have some option here to avoid such symptoms chronic fatigue or just a night shift is a verdict Well, globally, globally in general, this is a verdict That is, it is a matter of time when something breaks down even against the backdrop of support, because we interfere very hard with the entire work of our biological clock, they are anyway built one way or another that we are in it we have to stay awake at night we have to sleep with daytime sleep anyway we don\u2019t compensate it is very different from night sleep Unfortunately yes, against the background of drugs we can somehow bring it closer to get plus or minus also efficiency But the question is how often do you have to change your lifestyle when you are awake during the day and sleep at night If you have always come to the conclusion that you have been there for several months for years you work at night You will not have time Okay this can be somehow compensated for to come somewhere to stabilize to install and so on but if it is week to night week to day and so on, nothing good will come of it, the simplest thing we can do for our body in terms of sleep, even without drugs, without everything else is to start going to bed and getting up at the same time, even on weekends the simplest thing we can do even if it goes to private clean to get up 8 it\u2019s clear that our hormone production is disrupted and everything else is clear but we have such conditions that we go to bed after 12 ok if such conditions exist the best thing you can do is always lie down at 1 a.m. and always getting up at 8 a.m., this will greatly reduce the load on your body, because it will not have to constantly rebuild and after every weekend you only go there for half a week because there I decided to sleep off by the way about sleeping off sleeping off on the weekends this is a direct myth stereotype Yes, it doesn\u2019t work Unfortunately, no, because your adrenal glands are used to the fact that you have it there at 8 in the morning. You have to throw out cortisol so that you wake up. doesn\u2019t work and completing the topic of sleep, you said daytime sleep works in a completely different way, but many people praise these 20-30 minutes when after dinner it\u2019s right here nailing what is the place to be indisputably That is, if it\u2019s there 20-30 to an hour to 40 minutes it\u2019s okay, but you have to come to this for everyone, will it work positively no, but if you really need it, you can turn on your daily rhythm there, but stubbornly, it \u2019s still done exactly on, but everything else is additional, I thought that it definitely wouldn\u2019t work well if you do it at the workplace When the situation does not favor the situation with being overweight It is one of the typical ones that you are contacted with Or rather not It seems to me that every first comes with excess weight, but he does not consider excess weight as the main reason for the most part, almost everyone is unhappy with their weight, but this is not theirs so strongly define it as something else here It is necessary to understand because there are a great many reasons Yes, someone has the most banal This is insulin resistance because there are snacks or apples everything else is the first second this is chronic stress disruption of the adrenal glands considers the glands hence the slowdown in metabolism again leads to insulin resistance to a set in the first place in the first place, I probably put hypoxia precisely the lack of oxygen without oxygen, we have a coefficient of efficiency The efficiency of mitochondria is greatly reduced the efficiency of the muscles is reduced and you already count your daily calories, don\u2019t count everything will work completely otherwise these numbers will be very -very approximately, and, unfortunately, any girl will sooner or later come to an iron deficiency, because no one has canceled the monthly cycle of blood loss, no one has canceled it; therefore, difficulties arise for someone who will come there in adolescence, someone at 20, someone at 30 someone is closer to 40, but it always comes to this because they don\u2019t eat enough red meat about iron supplements, they only remember when they already start to move away or something else, so it\u2019s difficult for the male gender It\u2019s easier for us to not consume iron so actively but we have another problem - chronic inflammation very often almost everyone has this inflammation where the question is open Everyone has something of their own very often it's just the intestines, something he doesn't like, something goes wrong And against this background, ferritin is a strategic reserve iron, it simply binds and does not work normally, as a result, we still get a decrease in the efficiency of iron metabolism, a decrease in the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide and, as a result, hypoxia, completing all music with epoxy How can it be overcome. Especially since, as far as I know, there is another additional factor that aggravates smoking as a common bad habit only adds to the actual problematic, that's right, but here again, how to solve, again, an individual approach is needed, because application points Why do we have hypoxia, how do we have to solve a lot of them, many Athletes do not bother, they use some drugs that additionally stimulate the work of mitochondria additionally stimulates the blood supply to the brain so that all this works more efficiently. But this is again a Crutch, because the main problem we have not solved is how everything works, we have red blood cells that are responsible for transporting oxygen, carbon dioxide, they must be of the optimal size They must be adequately filled with hemoglobin protein in connections in conjunction with iron and they must again effectively perform their function for all this, three nuances must be observed in our body 1 It must be enough iron 2 there must be enough vitamins of the group First of all B9 B12 And the third all this should be in a compartment work normally, that is, there should be enough protein in girls, very often there is a problem due to a lack of iron once due to a lack of protein 2 because, as practice shows, protein is not enough for everyone except for those who really think it is, everyone else is catastrophically not eating up provitamins of group B, we have already said too general deficiency against the background of stress against the background of everything Yes, we are still faced with such a problem After the virus again, like copper-dependent anemia, since many people drank zinc at one time. Since they heard that zinc stimulates immunity, and so on, and zinc is an antagonist in our body. when you drink a lot of one, the second starts to leave, let's say, and stops working adequately, now it happens that against the background of a lack of copper, iron will again not work, iron is very capricious micro and there it is necessary that all the stars converge so that it is adequately assimilated adequately realized adequately performs its functions therefore in fact, this is iron protein, vitamins of group B Well, about the male sex, again, very often it is the removal of latent inflammation until you decide four nuances until all this 4 nuances normal hypoxia work with each other, only it will not be how you solve it if it is hidden in In this case, patients constantly ask me the question Will we try to look for it repeatedly, usually uselessly due to Long questions and a long understanding of how the body reacts to certain things, you come to the conclusion that very often elevated ferritin is inflammatory just associated with inflammation in the intestine, that is, you need work with the microbiota flora and possibly exclude any food-related allergy history, and now very often again this is a chronic viral load, because the virus very often likes to damage the mucous and mucous membranes, including drops, and from here some chronic inflammations arise, by the way, you recall the same topic with analyzes and crossing it with the question of allergies, now it also creates an analysis for food allergies if you have an opinion about it, because it\u2019s probably more logical to ask a gastroenterologist, but at the same time, it\u2019s possible that you have worked for a long time, talked with immunologists, swear as best they can I also came to the conclusion that the analysis is not effective because it will show you now what you have been roughly eating for the last few months there And you will get promotions for it Because you ate it more often who exclude it and transfer your diet a little to another Spectrum it\u2019s logical for you here immunoglobulin will decrease There they will increase now the gold standard in allegology is Alex 300 the so-called this is the only allergonal analysis that shows really true allergies to everything else. according to my own experience, for some, the period of cheerfulness is transferred from morning to the afternoon closer to sleep there And people like that even at night can do more better works just the same, it\u2019s connected with what we talked about in the refrigerator, the light was thought just for such people, this is also a bad idea if we wake up at night it doesn\u2019t matter Why go to the toilet or go to the refrigerator This is an unhealthy story if we go to the toilet very often the issue of muscle testosterone and so on if we wake up to eat with us there are questions with hypoglycemia That is, we have sugar drops at night the question is why, that is, here We need to figure out what is with carbohydrate metabolism, but very often this happens again in girls who constantly don\u2019t eat up there, they don\u2019t eat up and this problem is solved Just by adding portions of protein before bedtime and if a person didn\u2019t go to bed, but in the midst of initial work or I don\u2019t know watching a movie, now it would be better to polish it an hour before bedtime, then it\u2019s better to just have a portion of protein and all of them are ice cream from Yes, because it will be an extra portion of 30 grams of protein, which cannot negatively affect the work of our body, but we will be sure that we gave it something useful and not somehow harmed the viewers of this issue, it\u2019s quite possible that you tell about everything as consciously as accessible as possible, so I just had a desire to go to a specialist to consult at least about something I I want to be listened to with the same enthusiasm, they told me that everything will be fine, a person has a need, that's all, that's enough to endure, you need to go to a specialist. not a very worthy specialist here Unfortunately, only a trial and error method, first of all, I think that a doctor with a client with a patient should be on the same wavelength and understand each other, because anyway Yes, it\u2019s clear that a huge number of people come, but with many you are just psycho-emotionally you don\u2019t get along and it turns out that it\u2019s uncomfortable for him to communicate with you And when you have to still eat some patients Well, well, why didn\u2019t you do it, and so on This causes some difficulties, so I would put the second one in the first place. figure out what tests he wants to prescribe for you and If I went to the doctor I would clearly ask a question for each analysis Why do you want me to prescribe that one If the doctor can clearly explain what we are doing in order to understand This is what we are doing in order to understand here and there it\u2019s possible Yes, well, then you already need to try, and if the doctor also says that you need to take tests in this clinic and it is today that some difficulties already arise here, even more questions than we thought about clarifying iodine deficiency once again they advertise drugs on TV that right away everyone immediately pops up the names that we often hear Correct with iodine deficiency here is a drug that will really solve the problem or It\u2019s more like just a placebo Unfortunately it can support at some level as we used to bet there nuclear salt and so further, for some reason, many do not say that her ministry is collapsing to leave this salt, let's say, when marketing lies for a long time, therefore, the dosages that are there, they will not solve the problem, they can slow down something somewhere, do something, but here you need to understand it\u2019s clear that you have a widespread iodine deficiency, but is it possible to give this person here now, it\u2019s worth figuring out at least you need to pay attention to antibodies to TPO ectg if they are elevated and it\u2019s still not worth giving because there are still debates going on, some still give some do not give my position that it is not worth giving because very often, against the background of additional iodine, antibodies can be stimulated and grow. Therefore, the load on the pure gland will increase, plus it will definitely be necessary to do an ultrasound and then pick up the difficulties in what is now on the market with adequate iodine, probably Well plus or minus one and a half drugs as some other working things, so it\u2019s quite difficult to find the right drug in the right form Because there are both organic and inorganic ones In the right dosage, and here many still forget that, in addition to the thyroid gland, we need iodine in principle for the work of the whole organism But if the male gender does not particularly react to this, and girls have difficulties, girls very often, against the background of a very strong lack of iodine, there may be problems associated with the work of the ovaries, fibroid cysts, and so on, not all of this is connected, but very often it happens that both only you naturally restore the work of sex hormones do so that the ratio of progesterone to estradiol is correct so that the cycle works like clockwork thyroid gland Works like clockwork and against the background of all this you make up for iodine deficiency cysts go away with regard to typical mistakes when using dietary supplements and pharmacology What can be identified maybe again, some top here, my position is in two stages, the first stage, before prescribing hormone replacement therapy, it doesn\u2019t matter At what age the patient came to me, it doesn\u2019t matter What problems, even if there are problems about the fact that there is a decrease in libido and a decrease in erection, and so further, initially what I am doing is restoring the natural functioning of the body, restoring all deficiencies so that the body reaches the peak where it can now be on its own, and after all this, the second stage, I prescribe hormone replacement therapy Because when a patient just came to you and you immediately appointed him a substitute, it will be effective, no doubt, but the efficiency will be 60 percent, maybe 7230, you lose because your body was not ready for this. Yes, it\u2019s clear that rarely we can get some side effects, some problems, and so on. - as I already said, first restore everything after Let's replace hormone therapy this is my first position my second position I do not prepare people for performances I am for health and not for sports, therefore those who prepare athletes for performance in all you know This is a separate person who uses and complexes of compotes of various vitamins and so on. I don\u2019t do this either, I do hormone replacement therapy to increase the duration of the quality of life efficiency only solo drug solo because in the long term it is more effective if you don\u2019t need everything, but by the way, this is an interesting point that we did not touch together with that newspaper, and ours seems to be gaining momentum and it seems like more and more people are asking this question, but they are just the same, most often I hear the opinion that you need to hit on the forehead, that is, testosterone has fallen, you inject testosterone, everything is generally getting better right there, and here\u2019s how you - so starting with health, you just need to initially figure out why he fell, it\u2019s clear that after 30 every year he slowly goes to sleep a little about one and a half percent yes How quickly you feel it is an open question someone, depending on their testosterone receptors, will feel it in 28 And someone won\u2019t even feel it at 60, so the question is open. I use testosterone, but I use it, let\u2019s say so reasonably, after we have already restored the body\u2019s work and now we have brought a person to the Peak without a preparation, he doesn\u2019t come and says Everything is very good very but here, against the background of the fact that I got better, more energy appeared I opened a new business I have a lot of new things here further One more thing about nutrition in the same daddy, we\u2019ll add where we said food cravings for sweets, we defeated night eating trips to the refrigerator We coped with them, however, now there is even a recommendation that It\u2019s a good idea to resort to intermittent fasting and this is generally a step to health longevity and so on yes or no or not quite individually to say that intermittent fasting suits everyone I can\u2019t for people with genetic problems with carbohydrate metabolism intermittent fasting is contraindicated because there may be extra hypos that are not needed and so on but I don\u2019t see any problems in the widespread history Why no, intermittent fasting will improve the functioning of receptors due to this, we will slowly get away from insulin resistance, but we must understand that intermittent fasting is confirmed by itself, after all, two main meals Can you eat your norm Protein and fat for these two meals, provided that your Zheka you I still have to digest all this normally, learn to implement it. If yes No questions If no, perhaps it is necessary to use intermittent fasting but with three meals But then it\u2019s already more difficult or is interval nutrition for you How to understand if it\u2019s possible or not Yes or not How we select the optimal amount of proteins we divide fat into two doses, and if after the main meal we don\u2019t have any problems associated with the work of the gastrointestinal tract, bloating, severity of heartburn, violation of the stool or something else, everything is OK, if something arises, something needs to be changed, but in principle, not without food also very popular lately, some even go on some long hunger strikes dry something else Everything individually can be said so why not, but whether it will be better from all this, I'm afraid we will find out only in the process or at the end So we talked about chronic fatigue it\u2019s as if this aging process Yes, which is rapidly advancing, and many again, to myself, immediately after 30 feel that everything is no longer the same and will never be the same if this conditional conditional aging process does not respond to it and Let everything be as it will be what it can lead to Well, unfortunately, many people do this when you if it happened by counting fingers you had one level of energy yesterday another another you pay attention to it when it happens slowly but very confidently the stress of several years you understand what to get up It\u2019s getting harder and harder, your motivation is less and less all your feelings at work, there is less and less interest in all this, less and less you don\u2019t need anything within the framework of the network on the couch to drink beer, figuratively speaking, then against the background of all this, some kind of headaches or migraines may occur in girls very often it happens additionally here we can\u2019t help but remember about the problems associated with the cycle, some soreness before the onset or Our favorite food is the constant craving for everything that is bad during the onset of the cycle is it normal is it not this should not be the body should work adequately it should work right, and that\u2019s all, this is what I listed, these are the symptoms that something is going wrong with the body, you need to figure out why, how we came to this and, of course, we should start solving all this from the very beginning, our main task is to compensate the body, if possible, to give at least those fundamental things that we have already collected on a daily basis for everyone, let\u2019s say at least they are further personally selected individually, depending on the main complaints that we have when you already after two months of taking all the drugs, eating habits also change, the wakefulness cycle changes, work in principle of the body and the biochemistry of the body is drawn to how it should work where it should work, you already understand that Age is just a number no more And that even at 40 you can be with burning eyes and do what you are interested in, not only at 20 and not always on sgt, but in addition to all this, of course, hormone replacement therapy can be used. What is usually used is clear that we have testosterone for males for female estradiol, progesterone is also testosterone, but in small quantities it is clear that they sometimes use the thyroid gland If something goes wrong so sometimes even the adrenal glands, if something goes completely wrong, but here everyone knows exactly about this use of testosterone as the main support for the overall functioning of the body, here we must, let's say, weigh the pros and cons, and initially when patients come to me with such a request that here I am I talked to everyone, I talked to you, my friends are on the course from I want No question, let's do this first, I'll tell you first, we will restore the body's work further against the background of the restoration of the body's work, one way or another, testosterone will improve, plus or minus to the maximum as effective as it is possible now at his age, perhaps it will be enough for him and after that we will decide whether you need it or not. once a week But not for everyone, let\u2019s say this is the standard dosage for those who don\u2019t have 3-4-5 workouts a week there, it will be a lot. It needs to be less clear that we additionally support the body\u2019s work with the help of chronic Tropin so that the other one actually works adequately Well, it\u2019s understandable that we still interact with estradiol if it still grows from prolactin if it also grows but here everything is again individual from some genetic nuances what you need to understand I discuss this topic with patients for a very long time before prescribing because I explain that if we as everything is expressed, we turn to the dark side, then we are always there, simply because you won\u2019t like it without this support, the only option is when my patients and I leave for 2-3 months from the dark side to the light side, this is pregnancy planning, only we do it, we all launch we get pregnant and calmly move on in terms of examples. For example, people very often come who have the habit of extinguishing stress with alcohol and this habit develops so much that they can safely drink one and a half liters of whiskey in the evening in order to somehow drown out the work of the central nervous system in order to relax Well, let's just think about whether it will be right for them and is it even possible to say that you can't drink, you need to limit it, maybe correctly, but it won't work and he won't be able to; now there is a clear connection between stress and alcohol suppression, no matter what you say, no matter what you do it will be useless Therefore, here we go from the other side, here some droppers are added to improve the functioning of the liver, the natural work of the liver is restored, the deficiencies that you find against the background of all this, there is some change in the work of the body that they really do not like, alcohol ceases to affect them and not just they stop kicking and they stop jamming this work of the central nervous system of whiskey into the wind As a result, alcohol slowly begins to decline, why transfer a good expensive product when there is no sense from it and after a month or two he comes and says that of course I am very happy I am very sad here Let's move where -something further Because we have already solved this problem, it usually works exactly like this when you start working with a systematic approach and direct the work of the body where you don\u2019t need them to go where he himself carries because he is used to health as such a gentleman, in fact, summing it up is such a Hope you said so confidently that even at 40, eyes can burn like at 20, we all the time how sad and sad I would be during interviews, recognizing myself there in some mistakes that people make this 40 years and fire in the eyes, it sounds like a good prospect I recently heard that it\u2019s better to hope than to build expectations when you can be pleasantly surprised they are seriously disappointed so thanks for the hope Roman Thank you for sharing and I hope it will change people\u2019s lives for the better for today I\u2019ll remind you that we had a novel terushkin doctor in our studio endocrinologist co-founder and chief physician of the BMP clinic Many thanks to Roman for answering my questions I hope my questions were urgent and Roman's answers will really be useful and help make your life even better healthier and better for this we are filming these issues Thank you for watching share your thoughts share these videos with your friends in the comments and subscribe to the channel of useful content soon there will be even more [music]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Summary:\n\nThe article is a conversation with an endocrinologist discussing various health issues, the importance of sleep, weight issues, iron deficiencies, and hormonal imbalances.\n\nKey Points:\n\n1. Sleep is critical for avoiding chronic fatigue. Irregular sleeping patterns can cause various health issues.\n\n2. Many people experience weight gain due to various factors, such as poor nutrition, stress, and lack of exercise.\n\n3. Iron deficiencies are common, especially in women. It is important to maintain adequate iron levels through diet and supplements.\n\n4. Hormonal imbalances can cause various health issues. An endocrinologist can recommend tests to identify imbalances and recommend a treatment plan.\n\n5. Intermittent fasting can be an effective weight-loss strategy for some people but may not be suitable for everyone.\n\n6. Hormone replacement therapy can help improve quality of life for some patients, but it is essential to address underlying health issues first.\n\n7. Adopting a healthy lifestyle, including proper nutrition and regular exercise, can significantly improve overall health and well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, prioritizing sleep, maintaining a healthy diet, addressing hormonal imbalances and iron deficiencies are crucial factors in maintaining optimal health.

\n0:00\nthere are at least three factors that\n0:02\nare going to govern how quickly you\n0:03\ntransition from ingesting food to a\n0:07\nfasted State remember as you ingest your\n0:10\nlast bite or sip of calories that's not\n0:13\nwhen the fast begins your body is still\n0:15\nseeing food you're actually carrying\n0:17\naround food inside of you even though\n0:19\nyou're not putting it into your mouth\n0:21\nyou're still eating in some sense and\n0:24\nthe one meal per day while perhaps ideal\n0:28\nfor certain people's schedules\n0:29\nmay actually cause people to under eat\n0:31\nand in some cases that might be what\n0:33\npeople want they actually want to under\n0:34\neat but when we start thinking about\n0:36\nperformance in work and in sport and\n0:41\nwhen we start considering Hormone Health\n0:43\nand hormone production fertility that's\n0:46\nwhen we can really start to look at the\n0:49\nseven to nine hour feeding window versus\n0:52\nthe four to six hour feeding window\n0:53\nversus the one meal per day type feeding\n0:56\nwindow with some different objectivity\n0:58\nwe can start to look at it through a\n1:00\ndifferent lens because it turns out that\n1:02\nwhen you place the feeding window and\n1:05\nhow long that feeding window is actually\n1:08\nwill impact a number of other things in\n1:10\nparticular hormones that can be very\n1:12\nimportant for a number of things related\n1:14\nto sex and reproduction can be related\n1:17\nto\n1:18\nperformance at work performance in\n1:21\nathleticism and there are excellent\n1:23\nstudies on this so let's talk about some\n1:25\nconditions where having the feeding\n1:27\nwindow early in the day would actually\n1:29\nbe very beneficial\n1:30\nthere was a study that was published\n1:32\nrecently in cell reports again cell\n1:34\nPress Journal excellent Journal\n1:35\npeer-reviewed\n1:37\nthat looked at\n1:39\nthe distribution of protein intake\n1:42\nin different meals\n1:44\ndelivered either early in the day or\n1:46\nlater in the day and I'm summarizing\n1:48\nhere quite a lot but I should mention\n1:50\nthat this study was performed in both\n1:52\nmice and humans same paper mice and\n1:55\nhumans and involved hypertrophy training\n1:59\nessentially increasing the weight\n2:02\nbearing of given limbs to try and induce\n2:04\nhypertrophy which is the growth of\n2:06\nmuscle tissue\n2:09\nit does appear that muscle tissue is\n2:12\nbetter able to undergo hypertrophy by\n2:16\nvirtue of the fact that there's better\n2:19\nor enhanced protein synthesis early in\n2:21\nthe day because of the expression of one\n2:24\nof these particular clock genes called B\n2:25\nMal bmal\n2:28\nBML regulates a number of different\n2:30\nprotein synthesis Pathways within muscle\n2:33\ncells such that eating protein early in\n2:37\nthe day supports muscle tissue\n2:39\nmaintenance and or growth and in this\n2:42\nstudy they also looked at the effects of\n2:44\nsupplementing so-called BCAAs branched\n2:46\nchain amino acids Which is popular in\n2:49\nbodybuilding circles and in strength\n2:51\ntraining circles and BCAAs are essential\n2:54\ncomponents of\n2:55\na number of different foods but can also\n2:58\nbe supplemented\n2:59\nthe takeaway of the study is pretty\n3:01\nstraightforward however the takeaway is\n3:03\nif your main interest is maintaining and\n3:05\nor building muscle\n3:07\nthen it can be beneficial to ingest\n3:09\nprotein early in the day you would still\n3:12\nwant to obey this\n3:14\nwhat we're calling a kind of\n3:15\nfoundational rule of no not eating any\n3:18\nfood for the first hour post waking or\n3:21\nat least the first hour post waking\n3:22\nlet's say you wake up at 7am your main\n3:25\ninterest is in\n3:27\nhypertrophy or maintenance of muscle\n3:29\nthen you would want to ingest some\n3:30\nprotein sometime before 10 a.m but\n3:32\nobviously if you're interested in\n3:34\ngetting the health effects of\n3:35\nintermittent fasting that you wouldn't\n3:37\ningest any food for at least the first\n3:40\n60 Minutes upon waking now it's not as\n3:43\nif at 1001 am a gate slam shut and you\n3:46\ncan't generate hypertrophy of course\n3:48\nthat's not the case\n3:50\nhowever it's very interesting that it\n3:52\ndoesn't matter when the resistance\n3:53\ntraining the load-bearing exercise\n3:56\noccurs in the 24-hour cycle\n3:58\nso whether or not in other words people\n4:00\nare training early in the day or they're\n4:02\ntraining late in the day\n4:04\nit still appears that ingesting protein\n4:06\nearly in the day favors hypertrophy so\n4:09\nif you're somebody who's mainly\n4:10\nconcerned with muscle maintenance and\n4:11\nhypertrophy then it may make sense to\n4:15\nmove that feeding window earlier in the\n4:17\nday but if you are somebody who's\n4:19\ninterested in deriving the many clearly\n4:22\nestablished health effects of time\n4:24\nrestricted feeding and you are somebody\n4:26\nwho would like to maintain or build\n4:29\nmuscle\n4:30\nthen ingesting proteins in the early\n4:34\npart of the day would be important to\n4:36\nyou when you eat there's some period of\n4:38\ntime afterwards in which you're actually\n4:39\nstill eating at least from the\n4:41\nperspective of metabolism because\n4:43\nglucose is up insulin is up\n4:45\nand you're undergoing different\n4:47\nmetabolic and digestive processes that\n4:50\ndon't really speak to you being in a\n4:52\nfasted state right it's not just about\n4:55\nwhen you take your last bite or your\n4:57\nlast sip\n4:58\nhowever there are things that we can do\n5:00\nto accelerate the transition from a Fed\n5:03\nstate\n5:04\nto a fasted State and I want to\n5:09\nemphasize that the term fed state is\n5:12\nprobably a better way to think about it\n5:13\nthan eating or not eating because we\n5:16\nthink of eating as the verb we're eating\n5:18\nwe're eating okay we're done eating I'm\n5:19\nfasting now but you're not actually\n5:21\nfasting because you are fed so we should\n5:24\nreally think about fed and unfed States\n5:27\nbecause from a seller processes\n5:28\nperspective and from a health\n5:30\nperspective that's actually what your\n5:32\nbody and your system are paying\n5:34\nattention to\n5:35\nso there's a fun and exciting concept\n5:37\nrelated to this which is glucose\n5:38\nclearing\n5:40\nyou may have heard the old adage that if\n5:42\nyou take a 20 or 30 minute walk after\n5:45\ndinner that it accelerates the rate at\n5:47\nwhich you digest that food and indeed it\n5:49\ndoes\n5:50\nclearing out of glucose from your system\n5:52\ncan be accomplished through a number of\n5:54\ndifferent means but light movement or\n5:57\nexercise does increase gastric emptying\n6:00\ntime so for instance if you were to eat\n6:03\na meal that ended at 8 pm and just and\n6:07\nthen plop to the couch watch TV or get\n6:10\non your computer or go to sleep\n6:13\nit would be five or six hours until you\n6:16\nhave transitioned from a Fed state to a\n6:19\nfasted State however you can accelerate\n6:21\nthat considerably by taking a 20 or 30\n6:24\nminute just Light walk it doesn't have\n6:27\nto be speed walking it certainly doesn't\n6:28\nhave to be jogging but just walking\n6:30\noutside or moving around\n6:32\nlet's take a look at what high intensity\n6:34\ntraining of any kind does to blood\n6:36\nglucose because in this case it turns\n6:38\nout that when you do high intensity\n6:40\ntraining actually has opposite effects\n6:43\non blood glucose depending on whether or\n6:45\nnot you do it early or later in the day\n6:46\nwhen you look at the studies that have\n6:49\nexplored high intensity interval\n6:51\ntraining and its effect on blood glucose\n6:53\nthere are a couple studies that leap out\n6:55\nfor instance one that emphasized that\n6:57\nblood glucose levels will actually\n6:59\nincrease if high intensity interval\n7:00\ntraining is performed early in the day\n7:02\nand will decrease if high intensity\n7:04\ninterval training is performed later in\n7:07\nthe day\n7:08\nif you have ingested food throughout the\n7:12\nafternoon and evening and late in the\n7:13\nday and you're thinking about going to\n7:14\nsleep and you'd like to enter sleep in a\n7:17\nway that is less fed and more fasted\n7:19\nthen engaging in high intensity interval\n7:22\ntraining in the afternoon will lower or\n7:25\nevening I should say will lower blood\n7:27\nglucose and in that way we'll help you\n7:29\naccelerate your transition into the\n7:31\nfasted state provided you don't ingest\n7:33\nsomething after the high intensity\n7:35\ninterval training light walks after\n7:36\ndinner or any other meal for that matter\n7:38\nor high intensity interval training\n7:40\nprovided it's done in the second half of\n7:42\nthe day can lower blood glucose and\n7:43\nspeed the transition from fed to fasted\n7:46\nStates but I also mention it because\n7:49\nwhat we are really trying to achieve\n7:51\nwhen we partake in intermittent fasting\n7:54\nso-called time-restricted feeding is\n7:57\nwhat we're really trying to do is access\n7:59\nunfed States or fasted States it's not\n8:03\nreally about when you eat and what you\n8:04\ndo it's about extending the duration of\n8:07\nthe fasting period as long as you can in\n8:10\na way that's still compatible with your\n8:12\neating right not the other way around\n8:14\nand this gets back to this key feature\n8:17\nof our biology which is that what we eat\n8:20\nwhen we eat when we exercise when we\n8:22\nview light it's about setting a context\n8:24\nor a set of conditions in your brain and\n8:27\nbody so it's not so much about the\n8:29\nactivities that you undergo it's about\n8:31\nthe activities you undergo and their\n8:33\nrelationship to one another over time\n8:35\nand so in this way it really beautifully\n8:39\nhighlights the way that your biology is\n8:40\ninteracting all the time light is\n8:42\nsetting when you're going to be awakened\n8:43\nwhen you're going to be asleep when you\n8:45\neat is going to be determining when\n8:46\nyou're going to be awake and when you're\n8:47\ngoing to be asleep and when you eat is\n8:50\nalso going to be determining when you\n8:52\nare able to clear out debris from your\n8:55\nbrain and body and repair the various\n8:57\ncells and mechanisms of your body when\n8:59\nyou're able to reduce those inflammatory\n9:01\ncytokines throughout your body and this\n9:04\nis really the beauty of time research\n9:05\nand feeding which is it's not really\n9:07\nabout restricting your feet eating it's\n9:09\nabout accessing the beauty of the fasted\n9:11\nstate\n9:12\n[Music]"}, {"role": "assistant",

"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Breakfast is considered to be the most important meal of the day, as it helps start metabolism and fuels the body for the rest of the day. The above meal for breakfast consists of a ham and cheese omelet, whole wheat toast, and a serving of fresh fruit. With a total calorie count of about 350-400 calories, this breakfast meal contains a well-balanced mix of macronutrients that can potentially give your metabolism a boost.\n\nThe majority of the calories in this meal come from protein-rich sources like ham and cheese. Protein is known to help increase the thermic effect of food, which means that it takes more energy to digest protein than it does to digest carbohydrates and fats. This can result in a higher metabolism, leading to more calories burned throughout the day.\n\nThe whole wheat bread in this meal is an excellent source of complex carbohydrates and fiber. Unlike simple carbohydrates such as white bread, complex carbohydrates provide a steady release of energy, helping to stabilize blood sugar levels and preventing the afternoon slump. The fiber content in whole wheat also helps regulate digestion and control appetite, reducing the likelihood of unhealthy snacking.\n\nFruits are also an essential part of this breakfast meal, and they contribute to the overall nutrient profile of the meal. Fruits are a great source of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, which are critical for maintaining good health. Eating fruits in the morning also provides a feeling of fullness, which can help reduce the number of calories consumed throughout the day.\n\nIn conclusion, the above breakfast meal provides a healthy balance of macronutrients that can help boost your metabolism and provide sustained energy levels throughout the day. By starting your day with a nutritious breakfast like this, the body has ample time to break down and digest the food, providing a source of energy until the next meal.

Write about it - or if you are gifted with graphs, show it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "After consuming a breakfast composed of avocado toast, with 2 eggs, 13g of breakfast potatoes, and a glass of orange juice, one can anticipate how their metabolism will be kick-started for the day. In this short essay, I will explore the nutritional components of this meal and discuss how it affects metabolism throughout the day.\n\nFirstly, let's break down the main components of the breakfast and the approximate caloric intake:\n\n1. Avocado toast: One slice of whole-wheat bread (80 calories), half an avocado (120 calories), and a pinch of salt and pepper (negligible calories). Total: ~200 calories\n2. Two medium-sized scrambled eggs: ~140 calories\n3. 13g of breakfast potatoes: ~25 calories\n4. 8-ounce glass of 100% orange juice: ~110 calories\n\nApproximate total caloric intake: 475 calories\n\nIn terms of macronutrient distribution, the meal is dominantly composed of healthy fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. Based on this meal composition, here's what I believe the metabolism will be like to start the day:\n\nUpon consuming the meal, blood sugar levels are likely to rise, causing the pancreatic release of insulin, which helps regulate fluctuations in blood sugar. The healthy carbohydrates found in the whole-wheat bread and breakfast potatoes are broken down into glucose molecules, which are further processed as energy sources. The fiber content of avocado and whole-wheat toast slows down the absorption of glucose in the bloodstream, thus preventing a sudden surge in blood sugar levels.\n\nSimultaneously, the healthy fats in avocado provide long-lasting energy, which helps keep the metabolic rate constant. These monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats also contribute to the feeling of fullness, which can prevent overeating during the day.\n\nFurthermore, the proteins from eggs are essential for muscle repair and growth, and the thermic effect of the protein aids in boosting metabolism. As proteins take longer to digest, they promote satiety, which curbs hunger pangs for extended periods.\n\nThe orange juice, full of vitamins and antioxidants, enhances the meal's overall nutritional value. However, even 100% orange juice can still increase blood sugar levels, as it lacks the fiber found in whole fruit. It is essential to be mindful of the overall sugar intake during the day.\n\nIn conclusion, a great metabolism-boosting meal should consist of a balance of proteins, healthy fats, and carbohydrates in moderate portions. In this case, the described breakfast would likely provide a steady metabolism to start the day, as it is composed of nutrient-dense, balanced, and satiating ingredients. Consuming such a meal would primarily help maintain a healthy lifestyle, as it enables us to have the energy and enthusiasm required to perform our day-to-day activities without feeling sluggish or lethargic."}]}, {"facetValue": "describe a meal preparation scenario.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "engage in a conversation about a shopping trip, meal preparation, and the importance of teamwork."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "describe a meal preparation scenario."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "When Mary and John went to the store because Mary and John were hungry, John gave a shopping list to "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mary.

It's so refreshing to be outside with Ruby and Izzy after a long week packed with deadlines, work, and too many cups of coffee to count. Ruby leads the way, occasionally bumping into the slightly rickety fence that borders the path, her laughter lighting up the space like little firecrackers. Izzy trails more leisurely, the air around her tinged with the sweet scent of her strawberry lip gloss.\n\n\"So, Bailey, are you ready for that big project next week?\" Ruby asks, her dark hair bouncing on her shoulders as she turns her head to face me. Her smile is infectious, even her eyes seem to curl up at the corners.\n\n\"Ugh, don't remind me,\" I sigh, adjusting my red cat t-shirt and fidgeting with the edge of my plaid skirt. \"I've barely started, and I've got so many other assignments to catch up on.\"\n\n\"But it'll be easy for you, you're a genius,\" Izzy chimes in, her pink, sparkly earrings catching the light as she speaks. I can feel my cheeks warming up in a telltale blush at her compliment.\n\n\"Well... I might be struggling quite a bit more if not for your countless tutoring sessions, so...\" My voice trails off, unable to finish the thought. Compliments are hard to respond to; I usually don't know what to say.\n\nAs we continue along the sidewalk, the trio encounters a small caf\u00e9 that's a favorite among locals. Its brick exterior is lined with string lights, and people fill the outdoor seating area. Everyone seems happy, as if the bright sunshine disperses any lingering shadows.\n\n\"Guys, we should buy a little something to celebrate the weekend,\" Ruby suggests, gesturing at the cafe. \"What do you think? My treat.\"\n\nWith a unanimous nod of approval, we head towards the entrance. The air in the caf\u00e9 is warm and inviting, smelling of freshly ground coffee and soft, sugary pastries. One of the baristas is carefully pouring a double shot of espresso over an ice cream-filled cup. It makes me salivate, the smooth caramel streams diverging and then converging like a mesmerizing dance.\n\nAs Ruby orders, the world outside the caf\u00e9 begins to change. Shadows grow longer and waning sunlight turns the glass backsplash above the counter into a canvas of flickering flames. I don't notice I'm holding my breath until Izzy places her hand on my shoulder.\n\n\"You feeling alright, Bails?\" she asks, concern furrowing her brow.\n\nI shake it off. \"Yeah, I'm fine. Just feeling a bit... I don't know, antsy,\" I reply, trying to make it sound like no big deal. But the truth is, my heart is pounding. It's hard to say why, but there's an inexplicable heaviness building in my chest.\n\nRuby turns to us, all smiles, carrying a tray of desserts. My favorite, a chocolate eclair, sits in the middle, surrounded by fruit tarts and an absurdly tall slice of mocha cheesecake. I can't help but grin, tugging at the edge of my black leggings in excitement.\n\n\"I went a bit overboard,\" Ruby admits, her laughter drowned out by a sudden cacophony of noise from the kitchen. Pots clatter to the ground. Dishware shatters. The entire room fills with tension\u2014not just me this time\u2014like a string pulled tight on a violin that's about to snap. I can hear one of the baristas mutter something about being late with a shipment.\n\nAnd then it happens. Just as my nerves seem to reach their breaking point, the kitchen door swings open violently, and time seems to slow to a crawl. A waiter emerges, eyes wide and frantic, holding a bowl of heavy cream. The impact of the door hitting a table ricochets through the caf\u00e9, jostling the bowl from the waiter's grasp.\n\nMy own blue eyes, wide with shock, watch as the cream sails through the air, defying gravity for what feels like an eternity. Conversations around the caf\u00e9 cease as all eyes turn to me, the girl who's about to be completely covered in cream.\n\nThe impact is cold and wet, but it feels like nothing compared to the sting in my chest. My blonde hair is plastered to my face, tendrils of heavy white cream dripping onto my eyelashes. Just as quickly as the impact, the room fills with mixed chatter, and it seems as though everyone around me has something to say about this strange girl who just had a food fight without moving an inch.\n\nBut then Ruby is there, her face radiant with laughter. It's so contagious that Izzy cracks up too, cackling like the world hasn't just turned into a surreal mess around me. And after a moment, I let out a small, giggle. Somehow, their laughter feels like a security blanket\u2014a gentle reminder that not all eyes are my enemies, and that some days you just have to laugh when things go awry."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Bailey stis there, stunned, as cream pours down her front and into her lap.

A twinkle of mischief sparks in her dark eyes, and I suddenly realize what's about to happen.\n\n\"Food Fight!\" she yells, grabbing a fruit tart from the tray and launching it through the air with all the grace and subtlety of a high-spirited teenager. The glistening blueberries and sweet crust soar towards Izzy, whose mouth is agape in surprise.\n\nIzzy's eyes widen in shock as the fruit tart collides with the side of her face, sending juicy blueberries spilling down her shoulder like drips of indigo paint. She stands motionless, momentarily stunned like prey in the headlights. Then, with a snorted laugh, she scoops a handful of blueberries from her blouse and hurls them back across the room.\n\nThe chaos ensues. Laughter and squeals fill the air, punctuated by the occasional gasp of surprise as pastries and iced coffee are launched in every direction. A plate of scones from the neighboring table is commandeered; shards of broken pastry rain down on the pavement.\n\nTucked behind the counter, a barista ducks to avoid a missile of pastry cream aimed at her head, while another, momentarily stunned, is caught in the crossfire, a dignified smear of chocolate running down his pressed white apron.\n\nThe floor beneath our feet becomes an artwork of crushed tarts, scattered berries, and smears of whipped cream. What was once a bustling, orderly caf\u00e9 is now a battlefield of delectable chaos.\n\nMy body moves almost on autopilot, seized by the electric energy of the food fight. I dodge a flying croissant, only to be hit square in the chest by a stray cookie that crumbles upon impact. The air is thick with the war cries of my fellow patrons, punctuated by a sudden hissing of the steaming espresso machine providing an odd, albeit fitting, soundtrack to this strange and sticky battle.\n\nIn the midst of it all, my mind begins to quiet down, and the racing of my heart calms to a steady, joyful beat. Golden flecks of sunlight still filter through the chaos, catching floating crumbs and syrupy liquid mid-air as if suspended in a moment of pure, unadulterated joy. My pulse finally matches the rhythm of the room - one of undeniable excitement that comes from the messiest and most unexpected moments in life.\n\nAs quickly as it started, the madness reaches its crescendo \u2013 the last remnants of raspberry jam and crumbly shortbread soaring through the air like falling stars.

It's wet and sticky in places where the whipped cream glazes over the fabric. My plaid skirt is no exception, now resembling more of a spattered painter's canvas with streaks of bright fruit glazes, crumbs of pastry, and a stubborn dollop of cream perched just above the pleats. My black leggings have fared slightly better, but they too are splattered and smeared, the casualties of the creamy carnage we'd all reveled in.\n\nI shift my gaze towards Ruby, who seems to have been caught in her own stream of creative destruction. Her long, dark hair is flecked with bits of powdered sugar and the occasional chunk of rich buttercream clinging to her curls. Her eyes still sparkle, although they're now circled by a smear of chocolate from a long-vanished \u00e9clair. Her blouse, normally pristine, is dappled with patches of vibrant fruit stains, making her look as if she's just emerged from a run through an enchanted, pastry-filled forest.\n\nAnd then there's Izzy \u2013 the instigator. Her strawberry lip-gloss is now mixed with a slick of blueberry compote, giving her an impish, otherworldly aura. Her once-sparkly pink earrings are obscured by frosting, and crumbles of puff pastry nestle in the crevices of her cardigan. Her jeans, previously dark and unassuming, now proudly display streaks of lemon curd and tracings of icing like abstract, culinary tattoos.\n\nThe three of us stand there, awash in sugar, syrup, and vibrant colors, a living testament to the sweet anarchy that had entertained us for a fleeting moment on this sunny, unsuspecting day.
