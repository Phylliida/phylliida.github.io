Based on the information provided about the birth chart, the individual would experience significant events connected to marriage and relationships within periods connected to Venus and Jupiter.\n\nVenus is the primary planet associated with love, relationships, and marriage. It is placed in the 1st house in Aquarius in this birth chart. Depending on the individual's specific Dasha periods, look for significant Venus sub-periods or major periods in the timeline. These timeframes will have higher potential for marriage-related events taking place.\n\nJupiter, on the other hand, is responsible for overall growth and expansion in life. In this birth chart, Jupiter is exalted in Cancer and placed in the 6th house. Periods related to Jupiter, both major and sub-periods, could also bring marriage or relationship opportunities.\n\nTo analyze and gauge the timing of marriage more accurately, you will want to investigate the individual's personal Dasha periods and transits affecting their 7th house, Venus, and Jupiter.
