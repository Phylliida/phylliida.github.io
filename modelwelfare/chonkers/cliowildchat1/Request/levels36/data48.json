This theory suggests that employees are driven to act in a certain way based on the expectation that their efforts will lead to a desired outcome, and this outcome will be rewarding. In the case of GA, the company can use the expectancy theory to increase the motivation of employees by clarifying expectations and establishing a strong connection between individual and organizational goals. This approach may help GA to temporarily maintain employee motivation while they work on improving the compensation packages.\nAnother core HRM concept relevant to GA\u2019s situation is stakeholder theory, which highlights the need for organizations to manage relationships with various stakeholders effectively (Thornock, 2016). In GA\u2019s case, the relationship with trade unions has been challenging due to conflicts over pay and working conditions. These tensions could have been better managed through a more proactive approach to communication, negotiation, and conflict resolution involving all relevant stakeholders.\nThe concept of diversity and inclusion in the workplace is also critical for GA. Due to the mixed fleet crews, employees with different levels of experience, contracts, and backgrounds are working together, which could lead to conflicts or misunderstandings. It is essential for GA to foster an inclusive work environment that acknowledges and accommodates employees\u2019 differences while promoting a sense of belonging and collaboration.\nA relevant contemporary HR practice for GA is developing a strong recruitment and hiring strategy. As GA faces potential workforce shortages, they will need a comprehensive plan to attract and retain qualified employees with skills that match the organization\u2019s needs. This recruitment strategy could include targeted job postings, campus hiring, increased employee referrals, and the use of technology such as social media and online job portals. GA could also consider offering competitive training programs and development opportunities to entice prospective employees.\nFinally, employee engagement and well-being should be a top priority for GA\u2019s HR team. The current low morale and dissatisfaction among employees is affecting the quality of service provided to customers, further damaging the company\u2019s public image. GA needs to engage its employees by addressing their concerns, providing support, and creating an environment that promotes a healthy work-life balance. Such efforts can improve employee satisfaction, increase productivity, and thus boost the organization\u2019s overall performance.\nIn sum, GA\u2019s HR team should critically assess and implement appropriate HRM concepts and contemporary practices to address the critical issues of employee motivation, stakeholder relations, workforce diversity and inclusion, recruitment and hiring, and employee engagement and well-being. By proactively addressing these challenges, GA can create a positive work environment that ultimately leads to improved organizational performance and customer satisfaction.\n\nRecommended Solutions\nIn light of the aforementioned HR issues faced by GA, several recommended solutions can be proposed to help the airline address its current challenges, improve employee morale, and strengthen its public image.\nFirst and foremost, GA should consider engaging in open and transparent dialogue with its employees and the trade unions representing them. Maintaining strong communication channels, actively listening to employees\u2019 concerns, and being transparent about the organization\u2019s goals and challenges can help build trust and facilitate constructive negotiations (Baraldi and Radaelli, 2020). Collaborative problem-solving efforts with trade unions can lead to mutually beneficial agreements on issues such as pay, working conditions, and employment contracts, ultimately fostering a positive work environment.\nRevisiting GA\u2019s compensation packages is another solution that merits consideration. While the current financial situation may prevent immediate changes to employee compensation, GA could develop a comprehensive plan outlining adjustments to be made once the organization\u2019s financial health improves (Purcell and Hutchinson, 2007). This strategy may include offering more competitive salaries or restoring some of the benefits and rewards that employees previously enjoyed. By presenting a well-defined plan for the future, GA can regain its employees\u2019 trust and reinforce commitment to the organization.\nAdditionally, GA should consider implementing measures that promote employee engagement and overall well-being. This may involve offering greater flexibility with working hours, ensuring that employees have a healthy work-life balance, and providing resources for mental and physical health support (Kahn, 1990). By fostering a supportive work environment, GA can improve employee morale, reduce absenteeism, and enhance productivity.\nTo address the potential workforce shortage and recruitment challenges, GA needs to develop a strategic approach to recruiting and retaining talent. Armstrong and Taylor (2020) suggest adopting a multifaceted recruitment strategy that incorporates targeted job postings, partnerships with educational institutions, employee referral programs, and the utilization of social media and online platforms. Additionally, offering continuous learning, development, and growth opportunities within the organization can make GA a more attractive employer, ultimately aiding in the recruitment of new employees.\nLastly, GA should strive to improve its public perception by delivering exceptional customer service and addressing customer complaints efficiently. To achieve this goal, the organization must invest in training and development programs aimed at enhancing employees\u2019 customer service skills (Zeithaml et al., 2006). Empowered and motivated employees are more likely to contribute to an improved customer experience which, in turn, can positively impact GA\u2019s public image.\nIn conclusion, by implementing these recommendations, GA can address its HR challenges, improve employee morale, and enhance its public reputation, paving the way for organizational success and growth in an increasingly competitive market.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the challenges faced by GA highlight the critical role of effective human resource management in maintaining employee satisfaction, fostering a positive work environment, and sustaining a competitive edge. Through open communication and collaboration with trade unions, revisiting compensation plans, promoting employee engagement and well-being, adopting strategic recruitment approaches, and investing in customer service training, GA can address the multifaceted issues that currently affect the organization. By proactively tackling these challenges and prioritizing the well-being and satisfaction of its employees, GA can pave the way for success in an increasingly competitive market while enhancing its public image and solidifying its position as a leading global airline."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "References\n\nArmstrong, M., & Taylor, S.

This reflects an implicit assumption that the prosocial ITP that each SJT measures is context dependent. The assumption is that although each measures prosocial ITP, the occupational context of that ITP may importantly affect it so that people may develop beliefs that prosocial action is important for physicians\u2019 effectiveness, for instance, but not for attorneys\u2019 effectiveness. It also assumes that SJTs built for different occupations are not much correlated with each other and that an SJT for one occupational context is not likely to predict prosocial performance in a different occupational context."}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

The higher expected turnover due to the Great Resignation directly impacts recruitment and retention methods and associated costs for organizations in several ways. Employers need to invest more in employer branding and communication strategies to attract and engage potential candidates. They also need to provide competitive salaries, benefits, and workplace flexibility to retain existing employees. Retention efforts must include professional development, inclusive work cultures, regular performance reviews, and transparent communication. Increased costs may arise from higher spending on advertising job vacancies, recruitment agencies, onboarding and training new hires, and offering more attractive benefits packages. The organization might also experience productivity losses during times of high turnover.\n\nB. The rise of automation, digitization, and artificial intelligence (AI) in HR impacts recruitment and retention methods and the associated costs for organizations in multiple ways:\n\n1. Streamlining Processes: Automation and AI helps streamline the hiring and onboarding process, saving time and reducing administrative costs.\n\n2. Candidate Sourcing and Screening: Advanced algorithms can identify and screen potential candidates more efficiently than traditional methods, reducing the time spent on manual talent searches.\n\n3. Personalization: AI can help personalize the recruitment process by tailoring communication and interactions to individual preferences, making the process more enjoyable for candidates and increasing the chance of successful hires.\n\n4. Data-driven Decision-making: AI-powered HR tools can analyze vast amounts of data to enable more informed decisions about recruitment, retention, and workforce management.\n\n5. Talent Retention: AI can help identify patterns in employee behavior that could signal a likelihood of employee disengagement or turnover, allowing organizations to take proactive steps to address issues and retain top talent.\n\n6. Cost Efficiency: While there may be initial investments in technology, the increased efficiency and accuracy of AI and automation can potentially reduce overall recruitment and retention costs in the long run.\n\nC. Other HR functions outside of recruitment and retention that may be particularly concerned about automation, digitization, and artificial intelligence in HR include:\n\n1. Payroll and Benefits Administration: Automated systems can calculate and disburse payment more accurately and efficiently than manual processes, potentially replacing payroll staff.\n\n2. Data Management and Analysis: AI can analyze organizational data to discover trends and insights about the workforce, potentially reducing the need for HR analysts.\n\n3. Time and Attendance Tracking: Automated time and attendance systems can streamline the process of tracking employee hours and leave, potentially replacing certain administrative roles.\n\n4. Compliance Monitoring: AI-powered tools can monitor company practices for adherence to regulations and policies, potentially reducing the need for HR professionals who specialize in compliance-related matters.\n\n5. Employee Relations: AI-powered chatbots can handle routine queries, freeing up HR staff to address more complex issues.\n\nEmployees in these roles may need to upskill, learn to work alongside AI technology, or transition to other areas of HR that may be less susceptible to automation, such as strategic HR management or organizational development."}]}, {"facetValue": "get advice on how to promote greater uptake and awareness of a new HR program among employees.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "get advice on how to promote greater uptake and awareness of a new HR program among employees."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "provide tactics for promoting employee engagement with a new HR program."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "In the most recent class, we discussed various challenges related to increasing BOTH employee \"awareness\" and \"utilization\" of HR programs (in that discussion, potential ways to get more men engaged with health care initiatives).

The point of the question is to get you thinking less about the \"what\" and more about the \"how\" (the process) you would use from a tactical perspective.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Effective Communication:\n\nOne of the most important tactics to promote greater uptake of a new HR program is to communicate its benefits and features effectively to employees. This can be done through various channels such as email announcements, in-person presentations, posters, and workshops. In addition, the communication should be continuous to keep the program fresh in employees' minds and should be tailored to different employee segments, including specific messaging for men, women, and other demographics to address their unique concerns and needs. Furthermore, incorporating real-life examples and success stories of how this program has benefited other employees can help create a more relatable and engaging narrative.\n\n2. Collaboration with Managers and Peers:\n\nTo increase employee awareness and utilization of a new HR program, it is essential to involve managers and team leaders in the process. HR can provide managers with training and resources to help them understand the benefits of the program and how it can improve their team's performance, work-life balance, or overall wellbeing. When managers and team leaders embrace the program and promote its use within their teams, employees are more likely to be receptive and engaged. Additionally, creating a peer-to-peer support network or program ambassadors can create a more positive and inclusive environment, encouraging employees to participate and share their experiences.\n\n3. Incentives and Rewards:\n\nA tactical approach to promoting greater uptake of a new HR program is to offer incentives and rewards for participation. This could include financial incentives, such as discounts and rebates, or non-financial incentives like priority access to certain resources or recognition within the organization. For example, if the HR program involves health care initiatives, offering a discounted gym membership, wellness coaching, or free health screenings to employees who participate may encourage more people to get engaged. These incentives can be especially helpful in targeting specific demographics, like men, who may have traditionally been more hesitant to engage with wellness programs. Additionally, celebrating success stories and rewarding program participants with tangible benefits can create a positive reinforcement loop that motivates others to join.\n\nOverall, promoting employee engagement with a new HR program comes down to communication, collaboration, and incentivization. By effectively conveying the benefits of the program, enlisting the support of managers and peers, and offering appealing incentives, HR professionals can help ensure their fellow employees take full advantage of the resources provided by their organization."}]}, {"facetValue": "critique and provide amendments to an essay discussing the importance of job satisfaction versus job permanence.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "critique and provide amendments to an essay discussing the importance of job satisfaction versus job permanence."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "critique an essay on job satisfaction and job security and provide amendments for improvement."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "According to this IELTS question\uff1aSomebody thinks job satisfaction is more important than job security, while others hold the opposite view: job permanent is much more important.Discuss both views and give your own opinion\n Critique this essay and point out amendments\uff1a\nJob satisfaction and job permanence are two crucial factors when people choose a career.

The introduction could be more specific and engaging. It is important to capture the reader's attention and clearly state the topic and main points of the essay.\n\n2. The body paragraphs are somewhat disorganized and could benefit from better structure and transitions. Each paragraph should have a clear topic sentence and supporting details/examples to back up the main point.\n\n3. Some of the language and grammar could be improved. For example, \"To be more specific\" is a cliche transition and can be replaced with something more precise. Also, there are several instances of incorrect grammar and word choices that detract from the clarity and effectiveness of the essay.\n\n4. The conclusion is somewhat weak and could be strengthened with a clear summary of the main points and a final statement on the overall importance of balancing job satisfaction and job security.\n\nHere is a revised version of the essay that addresses these issues:\n\nWhen choosing a career, people often consider two important factors: job satisfaction and job permanence. Some argue that job security is more important, while others believe that job satisfaction should be the top priority. In my view, while both of these factors are important, job satisfaction ultimately takes precedence.\n\nOn the one hand, job permanence can provide a sense of security and financial stability, which is especially important in today's uncertain economy. A permanent job often offers steady income and benefits such as health insurance and retirement plans, which help minimize financial risks. However, it is worth noting that job permanence is not necessarily a guarantee of happiness or career growth. Some people may feel trapped in a job they don't enjoy, simply because it offers security.\n\nOn the other hand, job satisfaction can lead to increased productivity, creativity, and overall job performance. When people enjoy their work, they are more likely to put in extra effort and stay motivated, even in the face of challenges. In addition, job satisfaction can contribute to personal fulfillment and a sense of purpose, which can be just as important as financial stability in the long run.\n\nOf course, it is important to strike a balance between job satisfaction and job security. Ideally, everyone would be able to find a job that they love and that offers stability and benefits. However, this is not always possible. When faced with a choice between the two, I believe that job satisfaction is the more important factor. A happy and motivated employee is likely to produce better work and achieve more success in the long term.\n\nIn conclusion, while job permanence can provide crucial stability in an uncertain economy, job satisfaction should be the top priority when choosing a career. By focusing on what we enjoy and what motivates us, we can not only achieve personal fulfillment but also contribute to the success of our companies and communities."}]}]}], "numConvs": 10}, {"summary": "Helped plan and strategize career paths", "name": "Plan career path", "children": [{"summary": "Provided advice on career development, including planning, choosing fields, and balancing personal goals.", "name": "Plan Your Career Path", "children": [], "numConvs": 8, "conversations": [{"facetValue": "get advice on which university to attend.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "get advice on which university to attend."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "provide guidance on choosing a university."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "What university should I enter"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As an AI language model, I cannot accurately decide which university you should enter.

However, the finance industry is constantly evolving, and new technologies and financial products may challenge the relevance of the CFA program in the future.\n\nFor example, with the rise of quantitative finance and financial engineering, there may be increased demand for professionals with specialized skills in programming, data science, and artificial intelligence. This could potentially shift the focus away from traditional investment management, which is the core of the CFA program.\n\nAdditionally, there are increasing concerns about the time and financial costs associated with pursuing a CFA designation, which may discourage some from pursuing the program. The CFA Institute has recently announced some changes to the program to address these concerns, including reducing the amount of material covered and offering more flexible testing options.\n\nOverall, while it is difficult to predict the future of the CFA program, it is likely that it will continue to evolve in response to changing industry needs and demands."}]}, {"facetValue": "find a rewarding job that utilizes their background in biochemistry, experience in environmental engineering, and desire to make a positive impact on the world.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "find a rewarding job that utilizes their background in biochemistry, experience in environmental engineering, and desire to make a positive impact on the world."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "provide advice on career options based on the user's background and interests."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "I have a garden at the back of my terraced house in southern England.

Moreover, a mere 11% of organizations utilizing AI in their operations have witnessed significant returns on investment. To tackle these obstacles and effectively incorporate AI into a company\u2019s digital transformation agenda, businesses must address an array of technological, ethical, and organizational concerns.\n\nIn this article, I'll discuss three common challenges enterprises face when implementing AI and their practical solutions.\n\nProblem 1: \n\nMachine-learning models often require vast, diverse datasets to function effectively, yet obtaining such data remains a challenge. Insufficient data can lead to overfitting, biased models, and poor performance. \n\nData shortages result from data privacy constraints, a lack of historical data for new trends, small sample sizes, and the costly, time-consuming nature of manual data labeling. Acquiring permission to use sensitive data is challenging, and historical data often proves inadequate due to evolving trends and processes. However, adequate training data is essential for creating unbiased and accurate ML models capable of addressing a wide range of scenarios.\n\nSolution:\n\nSynthetic data serves as a viable solution to help overcome these challenges. When generated artificially to resemble real datasets, synthetic data can reveal hidden patterns, interactions, and correlations between variables, offering a substantial foundation for ML models. Balancing datasets and improving performance, synthetic data synthesis can supplement marginal classes without jeopardizing privacy.\n\nAdvancements in synthetic data have significantly increased its value for machine learning models. Techniques like generative adversarial networks (GANs) and Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) foster the creation of more realistic data while maintaining compliance and data balance. As technology evolves, synthetic data will play a critical role in overcoming data shortages, safeguarding user privacy and enhancing ML model efficiency and intelligence, becoming a practical solution for AI professionals and organizations alike.\n\n\nProblem 2: \n\nThe global shortage of AI talent is slowing advancements in areas like deep learning, natural language processing, and robotic process automation. This ends up hindering innovation and ecomonic growth. A survey by Indeed found that 63% of decision makers reported the greatest skills gap in AI and ML. While a clear solution emerged where 75% preferred to invest in upskilling of current staff and 64% favored bringing on new experts \u2014it was not without its challenges, like budget limitations or retention woes of upskilled employees.\n\nSolution\n\nIn today\u2019s talent shortage landscape, CIOs are increasingly embracing low-code/no-code platforms to democratize app development and ease workloads in IT departments. Faced with an estimated 85.2 million global software engineer deficit by 2030, businesses have found that low-code/no-code tools can increase their value by millions of dollars without hiring additional IT developers. The market for low-code technologies is projected to grow to $44.5 billion by 2026, with multiple converging factors such as faster application delivery demands, ongoing talent shortages, and a growing hybrid workforce. Low-code platforms have become an essential element of successful hyperautomation, with 50% of all new clients expected to come from business buyers outside the IT organization by 2025. However, to achieve their full market potential, low-code/no-code platforms must continually innovate in areas like AI and machine learning capabilities, real-time iteration, devops workflows integration, scalability, API development focus, and support for multiple personas. As digital transformation projects become a priority, CIOs and their teams are realizing that low-code platforms can accelerate app development by up to ten times. The future of these platforms will likely involve expanded capabilities for API integration, AI/ML services, and broader enterprise application support.\n\n\n\nProblem 3:\n\nAI spending has reached nearly $118 billion in 2022 and surpass $300 billion in the next few years. The cost of AI varies, with companies paying anywhere from $0 to over $300,000 for software, including custom solutions that range from $6,000 to over $300,000. Some factors that influence AI costs include the type of AI software (chatbots, analysis systems, or virtual assistants), whether a pre-built or custom solution is chosen, AI features required, and how AI is managed (in-house or outsourced). Project duration and complexity also impact the overall cost. \n\nSolution\n\nIn addressing the pressing issue of high costs associated with AI implementation for enterprises, it becomes crucial to optimize data processing methods applicable to multiple forms of data, including videos, text, and other pertinent information depending on size and nature. By adopting strategic and efficient deployment techniques, it is possible to achieve substantial cost reduction.\n\nCompanies can take advantage of pre-built options, with a range of AI platforms available at various price points to make AI a worthwhile investment for businesses of all sizes.\n\nEmploying dedicated hardware for video processing and leveraging edge computing solutions can be a more cost-effective alternative to relying exclusively on cloud-based solutions. This multifaceted approach not only streamlines data management processes but also significantly curbs the overall expenses associated with AI integration in the contemporary business landscape.\n\nConclusion\n\nCreating a comprehensive AI implementation plan doesn't have to be difficult. Companies should become familiar with any potential implementation challenges and develop a strategy in order to mitigate them. This includes crafting suitable interfaces, establishing necessary regulations, setting up data infrastructure, designing storage solutions, labeling data sets and feeding information into the AI system.

AI and automation enable small businesses to streamline processes, reduce costs and improve customer experiences, making it easier to stay competitive in an increasingly crowded marketplace. Despite concerns about cost, complexity and disruption, small businesses can successfully embrace these technologies with the right strategy and resources. Common areas where AI and automation can be applied in small businesses include customer service, sales, marketing, inventory management, accounting, and human resource management. However, there are also challenges to overcome, including cost and complexity, resistance to change by employees, data quality and security issues. To successfully leverage AI and automation, small businesses should focus on the customer, monitor and measure impact, invest in employee training and education, collaborate with others and start small. There are many case studies showcasing the possibilities and benefits of AI and automation for small businesses.\n\nAkaike Technologies is an AI-native company that provides sustainable, multimodal AI solutions to improve efficiency and increase ROI for customers. They offer a comprehensive range of Vision AI, Speech AI, and Text AI services that cater to the unique needs of each business.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, science fiction introduced the world to the concept of AI robots. By the 1950s, young British polymath Alan Turing explored the mathematical possibility of AI and how to build and test intelligent machines. However, computers needed fundamental changes and hefty expenses deterred investment in AI research.\n\nThe proof of concept for AI was initialized through Allen Newell, Cliff Shaw, and Herbert Simon\u2019s Logic Theorist program in 1956, which catalyzed 20 years of AI research. AI flourished from 1957 to 1974, but several obstacles emerged mainly due to lack of computational power. In the 1980s, AI was reignited by new techniques such as deep learning and expert systems. Although ambitious goals of the Japanese government\u2019s Fifth Generation Computer Project were not met, AI thrived during the 1990s and 2000s, achieving milestones like IBM\u2019s Deep Blue defeating chess champion Gary Kasparov in 1997.\n\nImprovements in computer storage enabled AI to make significant progress, and AI is now widely applied in fields such as technology, banking, marketing, and entertainment. The future of AI could involve AI language and driverless cars, while general intelligence and sentient robots remain long-term goals. As AI continues to advance, discussions about machine policy and ethics will be crucial.\nBefore you know the story of Akaike Technologies, it\u2019s important to know the story of our Founder Rahul Thota and his tryst with data science and artificial intelligence in  career spanning 20 years. It all began during his second year at college when he was trying to improve my grades with extra projects. Rahul decided to speak with his hostel warden, Professor Jalihal, and asked him if there was any work he could do. \n\nProfessor Jalihal came up with an interesting project for Rahul \u2013 converting a color image to black and white and then the other way around. Back then, we used MATLAB to handle this task. Using MATLAB, Rahul managed to convert the color image to black and white easily, although converting black and white to color wasn\u2019t mathematically possible.\n\nThat project really got him into image processing, and Rahul went on to work on more projects and internships in the field. At the time, he was using tools like MATLAB and, eventually, Python became a popular alternative. \n\nOver time, Rahul gained more experience by working with different companies and eventually started his own company, Akaike Technologies. Looking back, it\u2019s fascinating to see how the tools and methods of learning have evolved throughout the years. Today, there are degree programs in AI/ML and a stronger emphasis on self-learning and problem-solving.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s been an incredible journey, and Rahul is grateful for the opportunities and advancements in the fields of image processing, computer vision, and AI that have made it possible to develop effective solutions for complex challenges we once considered impossible to solve.\n\nYou know what we realized? Python is like a cheat code for non-CS folks to do really cool things. Even though my job doesn\u2019t involve coding, I still use it all the time. It\u2019s such an approachable language that you can start seeing results quickly and that motivates you to keep going. Plus, you can do almost anything with it once you get the hang of it.\n\nSpeaking of programming languages, let\u2019s talk about Matlab. Remember that image conversion project? It was easy to convert a color image to black and white in Matlab - just a few lines of code. But going from black and white to color is a totally different ball game. It\u2019s mathematically impossible to go from one number (grayscale) to three (RGB)  Nowadays, you can train an AI to do that kind of thing, but back then it was unheard of.\n\nAnyway, Rahul always loved working with images and graphics, which is why he did a couple of internships at a government research institute. He got to play around with all sorts of satellite and remote sensing data, like capturing images of different types of vegetation. It was fascinating to see how different spectrums could indicate different ways that plants grew. Even water bodies had different characteristics! From there, Rahul moved on to work with medical imaging and surveillance at Siemens and Microsoft, where he did a ton of research on background subtraction and registering CT scans and MRIs. It was so cool to see how combining functional and structural information could give deeper insights.\n\nBut back in those early days, Rahul had to deal with very specific problems, like tracking customers walking into a showroom. There was no one \u201cright\u201d way for them to enter, which made it a tricky (and expensive) problem to solve. Neural networks were just a concept, and cloud adoption was just starting to become a thing. It\u2019s amazing to see how far image processing and computer vision have come since then where you can even find solutions for unconstrained problems. \n\nSo, there are two different scenarios we  can talk about. The first one is when we were working on replicating some facial detection work. We were able to come up with a new scheme where we could extract a million features from a small image. It was pretty cool because we could identify vertical and horizontal patterns at different scales, which helped us figure out the facial pattern. We did it all from scratch, which was a bit challenging!\n\nBut nowadays, things are a bit easier because you can find open source code for almost anything. This means that you can clone a project on GITHUB and replicate it. Before, a lot of the research time went into just trying to replicate past results, but now you have access to all the code. Reputed researchers even put out their own code.\n\nIn the AI space, the availability of models and new ideas with different architectures is amazing. You can search and get new pre-trained models online. But the problem isn\u2019t finding a good face detection model or people detection model. It\u2019s really about understanding the constraints of the client\u2019s ecosystem and then making it work in the production setup. Once you have a solution, distributing it to the right people is what really matters. That\u2019s the bottom line.\n\nPreviously, a small dataset of only 5000 models was available and it required a lot of time to create a large repository of data. However, now there are thousands of datasets available for different varieties. Back then, training a model would take a month due to the lack of high-level tools and the limited computing ability. Today, the same computation can be done in just a day. The availability of datasets and advances in computing have made a huge difference. In comparison to the past, there is now a much higher level of interest in AI across departments, with groups from different areas coming together to build AI solutions.\n\nWhile in the past, coding was done mainly in C++, to build production models, it is no longer necessary to use low-level languages like C.

While there is no clear answer as to whether CS or AI/ML degrees are better, the number of people graduating with guided data science degrees is increasing significantly.\n\nThere has been a lot of change in terms of the companies and sectors that were previously involved in AI research. Many companies have now spearheaded AI research, and the most promising latest research is coming from them. Even within companies, there has been a diversification of work, with a lot more focus on computer vision and advertising data.\n\nOne significant development in computer vision is the Voyalla and Johns paper, which has increased the detection accuracy of faces from 60% to 99.99%. There has been a flurry of papers published on people detection since then. Overall, advances in technology have made building companies around AI justified, and there is a lot of excitement about the possibilities.\n\nAI is delivering real value to businesses, with insurers automating manual underwriting processes, retailers personalizing shopping experiences, and healthcare systems predicting patient outcomes. The growth of AI can be attributed to increasingly powerful graphics processing units, data scientists, and sophisticated algorithms. However, AI adoption for many enterprises remains at an experimental stage due to uncertainty regarding business prospects and confusion over which problems AI can solve.

They offer a comprehensive range of Vision AI, Speech AI, and Text AI services that cater to the unique needs of each business.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, science fiction introduced the world to the concept of AI robots. By the 1950s, young British polymath Alan Turing explored the mathematical possibility of AI and how to build and test intelligent machines. However, computers needed fundamental changes and hefty expenses deterred investment in AI research.\n\nThe proof of concept for AI was initialized through Allen Newell, Cliff Shaw, and Herbert Simon\u2019s Logic Theorist program in 1956, which catalyzed 20 years of AI research. AI flourished from 1957 to 1974, but several obstacles emerged mainly due to lack of computational power. In the 1980s, AI was reignited by new techniques such as deep learning and expert systems. Although ambitious goals of the Japanese government\u2019s Fifth Generation Computer Project were not met, AI thrived during the 1990s and 2000s, achieving milestones like IBM\u2019s Deep Blue defeating chess champion Gary Kasparov in 1997.\n\nImprovements in computer storage enabled AI to make significant progress, and AI is now widely applied in fields such as technology, banking, marketing, and entertainment. The future of AI could involve AI language and driverless cars, while general intelligence and sentient robots remain long-term goals. As AI continues to advance, discussions about machine policy and ethics will be crucial.\nBefore you know the story of Akaike Technologies, it\u2019s important to know the story of our Founder Rahul Thota and his tryst with data science and artificial intelligence in  career spanning 20 years. It all began during his second year at college when he was trying to improve my grades with extra projects. Rahul decided to speak with his hostel warden, Professor Jalihal, and asked him if there was any work he could do. \n\nProfessor Jalihal came up with an interesting project for Rahul \u2013 converting a color image to black and white and then the other way around. Back then, we used MATLAB to handle this task. Using MATLAB, Rahul managed to convert the color image to black and white easily, although converting black and white to color wasn\u2019t mathematically possible.\n\nThat project really got him into image processing, and Rahul went on to work on more projects and internships in the field. At the time, he was using tools like MATLAB and, eventually, Python became a popular alternative. \n\nOver time, Rahul gained more experience by working with different companies and eventually started his own company, Akaike Technologies. Looking back, it\u2019s fascinating to see how the tools and methods of learning have evolved throughout the years. Today, there are degree programs in AI/ML and a stronger emphasis on self-learning and problem-solving.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s been an incredible journey, and Rahul is grateful for the opportunities and advancements in the fields of image processing, computer vision, and AI that have made it possible to develop effective solutions for complex challenges we once considered impossible to solve.\n\nYou know what we realized? Python is like a cheat code for non-CS folks to do really cool things. Even though my job doesn\u2019t involve coding, I still use it all the time. It\u2019s such an approachable language that you can start seeing results quickly and that motivates you to keep going.

Summarize all the paragraphs into one paragraph with a word count under 200 words, 'How automation, low code/no code can fight the talent shortage\n\nCIOs today are quick to pursue low-code/no-code platforms to democratize app development, enabling line-of-business teams to create the apps they need. The intuitively designed, declarative drag-and-drop interfaces core to leading platforms from Microsoft, Salesforce, ServiceNow and other vendors lead to quick initial adoption and pilot projects. \nAlready-overwhelmed IT teams welcome the chance to delegate development to business units that are showing a strong interest in learning low-code and no-code development. Facing a severe ongoing labor shortage, CIOs are looking to low-code and no-code platforms to ease the workloads in their departments. \nThe U.S. Department of Labor estimates that the global shortage of software engineers may reach 85.2 million by 2030. More than four out of five businesses cannot attract or retain their software developers or engineers. In response, the average company obviated the need for hiring two IT developers by using low-code/no-code tools, which generated an estimated $4.4 million increase in business value over three years.  \nContinual innovations keep the market growing  \nLow-code/no-code platforms are meeting enterprises\u2019 need to create new apps in response to evolving customer, market, operations and regulatory needs. According to Gartner, the market for low-code development technologies is projected to grow to $44.5 billion by 2026 at a compound annual growth rate of 19%.\nBy 2026, adoption of low-code development technologies by large and midsize organizations will accelerate, thanks to several factors, including the demand for faster application delivery with low engineering input, continued tech talent shortages and a growing hybrid or borderless workforce. Democratization, hyperautomation and composable business initiatives will also be key drivers accelerating the adoption of low-code technologies over the next three years.\nMeanwhile, Gartner estimates that 41% of employees in an enterprise are business technologists who report outside of IT and create analytics and app capabilities for internal or external business use. Low-code platforms have become a crucial element of successful hyperautomation. \nThirteen percent of business technologists state that low-code development tools are among the top three tools they have used most frequently, and in large quantities, to support automation efforts in the past year. Enterprises are also adopting application composition technologies that allow fusion teams to create composable applications. Low-code platforms are critical because they allow for greater composability of application services, functionality and capabilities.\nGartner also predicts that 50% of all new low-code clients will come from business buyers outside the IT organization by 2025. And Microsoft anticipates that of the 500 million apps it expects will be created over the next five years, 450 million will be designed on low-code/no-code platforms.  \nFor these platforms to deliver the full market potential they\u2019re projected to, the following six areas need to see continual innovation over the next three to five years:\nDesigning and incorporating AI and machine learning capabilities to enable in-app intelligence and the rebuilding of components.\nConstructing low-code platforms that allow for real-time iteration, thus reducing the overall development cycle.\nImplementing a consistent infrastructure and architectural strategy that seamlessly integrates with devops workflows.\nImproving the ability to scale and support data-centric and process-centric development cycles.\nIncreasing the focus in API development on improving integration with on-premises and cloud-based data.\nEnsuring that the same code line can support multiple personas, including frameworks, app templates and tools.\nDigital transformation projects stress-test platforms\u2019 scale and usability \nCIOs tell VentureBeat that projects aimed at digitally transforming selling, service and customer success strategies dominate their roadmaps today. How quickly new digitally-driven revenue initiatives can get online is an increasingly popular metric in CIOs\u2019 compensation and bonus plans this year.\nMany CIOs and their teams are turning to low-code platforms to keep up with project plans and roadmaps. Every IT department ideally wants to avoid the slow progress and complexities of full-stack development. Ongoing improvements in low-code platforms that allow for the creation of custom applications with minimal manual coding are critical to their increasing adoption.\nDigital transformation projects are ideal for stress-testing low-code and no-code platforms. CIOs and their teams are finding that low-code platforms have the potential to accelerate app development by a factor of 10. Achieving that level of performance gain is predicated on having an excellent training and development program for business analysts and other citizen developers who create apps to support an enterprise\u2019s line-of-business division reporting and analysis.\n\u201cWith low code, innovative apps can be delivered 10 times faster, and organizations can turn on a dime, adapting their systems at the speed of business,\u201d said Paulo Rosado, CEO at OutSystems. \u201cLow code provides a real and proven way for organizations to develop new digital solutions much faster and leapfrog their competitors.\u201d \nAnother aspect of the digital transformation stress test on low-code/no-code platforms is that these platforms need a consistent, simple, scalable app governance process. When governance varies by platform, it\u2019s nearly impossible to scale an enterprise app corporate-wide without extensive customization and expense.\nCIOs are also finding that platforms can grow beyond initial budgets quickly as their hidden costs become apparent. These include getting beyond the limited process workflow support that further challenges an app\u2019s ability to scale enterprise-wide.\nNearly every CIO VentureBeat spoke with said they currently have several low-code platforms, each assigned to a different business unit or division based on unique development needs. Each business unit contends that the low-code platform they have adopted is ideal for their personas. Yet the low-code platform leaders promise they can serve all personas needed for a single database. CIOs are left to manage a diverse and growing base of low-code and no-code platforms to ensure the autonomy of business units that want the freedom to build their apps on their own, often accelerated, schedules.   \nHow low code/no code will evolve this year   \nStraightforward digital transformation projects are emerging as the crucible needed for low-code/no-code platforms to continue becoming enterprise-ready. Look for these platforms to expand their capabilities to include broader API integration support, more advanced AI/ML services and improved support for multiple workflow scenarios.\nLow-code/no-code platform providers are also focusing on cloud-native scalability to support larger enterprise deployments. Many are working toward providing more in-depth governance and collaboration tools to support cross-functional teams composed of business analysts, citizen developers and devops teams, including IT developers.\nAnother goal is to compose applications from multiple API and service types, so low-code/no-code platforms can address a broader range of enterprise application requirements \u2014 leading enterprises to choose them as a core application program for the long term.'\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In today's talent shortage landscape, CIOs are increasingly embracing low-code/no-code platforms to democratize app development and ease workloads in IT departments.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to change the world. AI can help automate decisions and processes, predict and shape future outcomes and optimise employees\u2019 time to focus on higher value work. The problem is, advances in AI are being slowed by a global shortage of workers with skills and experience in areas such as deep learning, natural language processing and robotic process automation. The talent pool for such disciplines is limited and therefore in high demand\u2013 so much so that some companies encounter inter-departmental jostling for software programmers and IT developers who have the prized expertise.\n\nAdvances in AI are being slowed by a global shortage of workers with skills and experience in areas such as deep learning, natural language processing and robotic process automation.\nThat demand goes far beyond the IT department. According to the research and advisory company Gartner, the strongest demand for talent with AI skills over the past four years has come not from IT department but from other business units \u2013 marketing, sales, customer service, finance, and research and development.\nAugmenting human intelligence\nPeople are essential to the success of any digital transformation project. AI can automate much of the mundane administrative work and repetitive tasks that employees used to spend hours on \u2013 enabling them to focus on more creative, analytical and strategic work that can give their organisation a competitive edge.\nOrganisations can start by identifying those mundane tasks that can be performed by AI \u2212 such as scanning thousands of insurance claims for possible fraud, summarising the morning\u2019s news stories or even sharing price recommendations to customers of an investment company. That can leave employees free to do the more stimulating work that adds value to their company.\n\nHowever, even big corporations with large IT departments may struggle to find staff with the requisite AI skills to start using the technology\nThis is where various technologies can oil the wheels of AI. For example, AutoAI, a capability within IBM Watson Studio, can help companies get started with AI by automating the laborious parts of a project, including preparing data and developing AI models.\nFor projects that are heavy on data science, IBM can provide customers with a data science team to work with the client to design and pilot an AI project.\nDeutsche Lufthansa, Germany\u2019s largest airline, recognised early on that with the right data and AI strategy, it could improve customer services, empower employees and improve operational efficiency.\nThe airline has worked with IBM and its cloud computing services to move from AI proof-of-concepts to scaling data science projects across the organisation. Lufthansa built a computer platform enabling its data scientists to experiment and test AI projects before rolling them out across the company.\nAugment and retrain\nAI can be a game changer for organisations, but skills shortages and the complexity of data models and AI technologies can stall progress.\nTechnology can do much of the heavy lifting in the early stages of an AI project.\nFortunately, when implemented correctly, technology can do much of the heavy lifting in the early stages of an AI project. By using machine learning to automate data tasks, such as creating and testing a data model, it can cut experimentation time from weeks, to hours, or even minutes.\nOrganisations can use Low Code Platforms to automate the development of a data model, measure the accuracy and pick the best algorithms.\nBusinesses may have a shortage of workers with AI skills, and as a result, need external support. This helps organisations plug tech skill shortages and overcome the challenges of AI adoption.\nGiven that there has been much speculation that AI will replace many human workers and cause widespread job losses over the coming decades, it\u2019s important that organisations reassure workers about the AI they use.\nAfter all, new technologies usually create new jobs. Also, the main value of AI is to augment human work and reduce drudgery, rather than make employees redundant.\nThere is no quick and easy solution to the AI skills gap, but by following a three-pronged approach \u2013 training staff in data and AI skills, infusing AI technologies to automate mundane tasks, freeing up human workers to upskill and using AI to streamline hiring \u2013 companies will be doing much to close the talent shortage.\"\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The global shortage of AI talent is slowing advancements in areas like deep learning, natural language processing, and robotic process automation.

There are many programming languages to choose from, but some popular ones for beginners include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby. I would recommend starting with Python, as it has a simple syntax and a large community which means finding help will be easier.\n\nTo begin, let's go over some basic Python concepts:\n\n1. Installation and setup:\nFirst, install Python (preferably version 3.x) from https://www.python.org/downloads/.\n\n2. Writing code:\nYou can write Python code using any text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook.\n\n3. Running code:\nTo run Python code in a script file (for example, script.py), open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder containing the script, and then run `python script.py`.\n\nNow let's learn some coding concepts with Python:\n\n**Variables:**\nVariables are used to store data in a program.\n\n```python\nx = 5\nname = \"John\"\n```\n\n**Data types:**\nPython has many data types like integers (int), floats, strings (str), and booleans (bool). You can convert between them using functions such as `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, and `bool()`.\n\n```python\nnum = 42\nnum_str = str(num)  # num_str is \"42\"\n```\n\n**Operations:**\nYou can perform arithmetic and comparison operations.\n\n```python\nadd = 2 + 3\nmultiply = 2 * 3\ndivide = 4 / 2\nequal = 4 == 4\nnot_equal = 4 != 5\n```\n\n**Control structures:**\nIf statement:\n\n```python\nif 5 > 3:\n    print(\"5 is greater than 3\")\nelif 3 > 5:\n    print(\"3 is greater than 5\")\nelse:\n    print(\"3 and 5 are equal\")\n```\n\nFor loop:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(i)\n```\n\nWhile loop:\n\n```python\ncounter = 0\nwhile counter < 5:\n    print(counter)\n    counter += 1\n```\n\n**Functions:**\n\n```python\ndef greet(name):\n    return \"Hello, \" + name + \"!\"\n\nprint(greet(\"John\"))  # Output: Hello, John!\n```\n\nI suggest practicing these concepts and gradually learning more advanced topics as needed. Check out resources like Codecademy, Coursera, or w3schools for more tutorials and exercises. Don't forget to practice regularly and join coding communities to learn from others and share your experiences. Good luck!"}]}]}], "numConvs": 9}, {"summary": "Offer general professional help including resume building, interview preparation, and career advice", "name": "Provide professional guidance", "children": [{"summary": "Offer assistance in a professional setting when needed.", "name": "Offer General Professional Help", "children": [], "numConvs": 9, "conversations": [{"facetValue": "provide assistance, though it's not clear what specific type of help is needed.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "provide assistance, though it's not clear what specific type of help is needed."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "help the user understand the context of the conversation and provide appropriate assistance."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "2"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm sorry, I need more information or a clear question in order to assist you.
