It doesn't shed, feels nice on the skin, and doesn't overheat me.It's decent to clean. My cat peed in it, so we decided to carpet-extract it to get the smell out. This worked, so you don't necessarily need to pull it apart to clean if you don't want to.This is a really fun idea, but the implementation is lacking. For $240, it's overpriced.

Here's how you would do it step-by-step, followed by an application example.\n\n### Steps to Calculate Jaccard Coefficient for Two Queries:\n\n1. **Execute both queries**: Run both queries in the information retrieval system to get two sets of documents. Let\u2019s call the set of documents retrieved by the first query `A`, and the set retrieved by the second query `B`.\n\n2. **Identify intersecting documents**: Determine the set of documents that are common to both sets `A` and `B`. This is the intersection set, usually denoted as `A \u2229 B`.\n\n3. **Compute the union of documents**: Identify all unique documents that are retrieved by either query. This forms the union of sets `A` and `B`, denoted as `A \u222a B`.\n\n4. **Calculate the Jaccard Coefficient**: The Jaccard Coefficient is calculated using the following formula:\n\n\\[ J(A, B) = \\frac{|A \u2229 B|}{|A \u222a B|} \\]\n\nwhere `|A \u2229 B|` is the number of documents in the intersection and `|A \u222a B|` is the number of documents in the union.\n\n### Application Example:\n\nImagine that Query 1 (`Q1`) retrieves documents `[D1, D2, D3]`, and Query 2 (`Q2`) retrieves `[D2, D3, D4, D5]`.\n\n1. **Sets for each query**:\n   - Set A: {D1, D2, D3}\n   - Set B: {D2, D3, D4, D5}\n\n2. **Intersection of A and B**:\n   - A \u2229 B: {D2, D3}\n\n3. **Union of A and B**:\n   - A \u222a B: {D1, D2, D3, D4, D5}\n\n4. **Calculate the Jaccard Coefficient**:\n   - J(A, B) = |A \u2229 B| / |A \u222a B| = 2 / 5 = 0.4\n\nThe Jaccard Coefficient for these two queries is 0.4, indicating that 40% of the retrieved documents are shared between the two queries. This measure could be used to understand the similarity between the queries in terms of their retrieved results.

However, the choice of terms included in the queries can influence the resulting document sets and thus the calculated Jaccard similarity. Here's how:\n\n- **Common terms (high document frequency)**: If both queries contain terms that are very common across the document corpus, they are likely to retrieve a larger number of documents, including many that are not particularly relevant to the specific information need. This can inflate the size of both the intersection and the union, potentially leading to a Jaccard Coefficient that suggests a higher similarity due to the prevalence of these common terms, rather than a meaningful thematic or topical similarity.\n\n- **Rare terms (low document frequency)**: Conversely, if the queries contain rare terms that only appear in a few highly relevant documents, the resulting retrieved sets may be smaller and more focused. This can lead to a Jaccard Coefficient that is lower if the rare terms do not overlap, or higher if they do, thus potentially providing a more accurate measure of the actual similarity between the queries' intents.\n\nIn practical information retrieval applications, variants of the basic Jaccard Coefficient or additional measures might be used to account for term frequency and other factors to provide a more nuanced similarity assessment. For example, the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) weighting scheme could be used in conjunction with Jaccard similarity to give less weight to common terms and more weight to rare, relevant terms.

These common terms may not be central to the main intent of the queries, leading to a misleadingly high similarity measure.\n\nIn other words, a high Jaccard Coefficient due to overlapping common terms may not accurately reflect the conceptual similarity of the queries.

Unlike raw term frequency which increases proportionally with the number of term occurrences, log frequency weighting scales this growth logarithmically. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Less Sensitive to High Frequency**: Common terms that appear many times within a document (e.g., \"the\", \"is\", \"of\") would disproportionately inflate a document's relevance score if raw frequency was used. Log frequency weighting mitigates this by providing diminishing returns as term frequency increases, which means that each additional occurrence of a term contributes less to the score.\n\n2. **Increased Discrimination**: By dampening the impact of high-frequency terms, log frequency weighting also increases the relative importance of medium- and low-frequency terms, which are often more indicative of a document's unique content.\n\nThus, the log frequency weighting helps ensure that a document containing a term many times does not dominate over documents that contain the term fewer times but might be more contextually relevant to the query.

Identify the data elements: Determine the data elements you need to collect and store in the database.

Create a logical data model: Create a logical data model that visually represents the relationships between the data elements. This will help you identify the fields needed for each data element and how they are related to other data elements.\n\n4. Choose a database management system: Select a suitable database management system (DBMS) that can efficiently manage the data stored in the database. Some examples of DBMS include MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n\n5. Create a physical database model: Once you have identified the relationships between the data, create a physical database model that outlines how the data will be stored in the database. Decide on the data types and constraints for each field and create a schema that represents the database structure.\n\n6. Set up the database tables: Create the database tables and indices according to the schema defined in the physical data model. Ensure the database is secure and follow best practices for user and role management.\n\n7. Populate the database: Once the database is set up, populate it with data from various sources such as student records, academic transcripts, and attendance records.\n\n8.
