The cost of a Google Play Console account is a one-time fee of $25.\n\n- App development: You need to develop your app and test it thoroughly before releasing it to the public. The time and cost involved in app development depend on the complexity of the app and the development resources you have.\n\n- Pre-beta testing: Before releasing your app to the public, you may want to conduct pre-beta testing to get feedback from a select group of users. This may involve some cost in terms of testing tools, hiring testers, or compensating the testers for their time.\n\n- Play Store release: Once you are ready to release your pre-beta app on the Play Store, you need to create a listing page for your app, set up pricing and distribution options, and submit it for review by Google. This process can take several days to a few weeks, depending on the complexity of your app and the review process.\n\nTherefore, the cost and timeline for launching a pre-beta on Google Play Store would depend on various factors mentioned above."}]}]}]}]}
