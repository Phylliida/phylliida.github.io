It also provides a critical source of raw materials for the manufacturing, transportation, construction, and energy sectors. Demand for raw materials is projected to increase as the world population grows and many low-income economies become middle- income countries. This growth in mineral demand, coupled with falling mineral ore grade, will likely increase the mining industry\u2019s energy demand, used for activities across exploration, extraction, beneficiation and processing, and refining. Mine operations are \u2013 due to their remoteness \u2013 dependent on fossil fuels such as diesel, heavy oils, and coal. In principle, mining could use energy recovery, renewable energy, and carbon capture to supplement, replace, or mitigate the impacts of fossil fuel use. This scarcity of fossil fuel resources and the environmental issues associated with burning these fuels have encouraged scientists to look for alternative and renewable sources of energy. Geothermal energy is recognized as one of the most promising and cleanest options for heat production and electricity generation. It has the advantages such as independency form climate conditions, relatively low emission, and comparative low energy generation cost. Geothermal resources are typically used for two purposes: electricity generation and usage of heating/cooling systems in houses and industries.\nHere, mines can play an important role in the production of geothermal energy. Exploiting the geothermal resources of a mine can offset some economic costs by supplying green heat to the communities living in and around the mine area. I want to continue my education in this field.

To get a good understanding of the topics related to energy systems. I have taken courses related to energy, resources and Storage as well as participated in seminars and conferences with the aim of improving my knowledge and vision of the future of the energy industry. Also, by obtaining programming and research degrees and using them in team projects, I have been able to enhance my individual and group skills such as verbal communication, management, and creativity. My learning experience under the guidance of my advisor has convinced me not only of the potential of research but also of the value of teaching. I have also enjoyed working as an undergraduate teaching assistant for introductory earth science courses.

In the context of coal, Langmuir adsorption refers to the ability of gases, such as methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen, to adsorb onto the surface of coal particles.\n\nHere are some steps you can follow to create a PowerPoint presentation about Langmuir adsorption in coal:\n\n1. Begin with an introduction to adsorption, defining what it is and why it is important.\n\n2. Discuss the definition of Langmuir adsorption and how it specifically applies to coal. Use simple language and clear graphics to illustrate the point.\n\n3. Describe the properties of coal that make it a suitable substance for adsorption, such as its microporous structure and large surface area.\n\n4. Explain how adsorption is measured in coal using techniques such as BET (Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller) analysis and gas adsorption isotherms.\n\n5. Describe the applications of Langmuir adsorption in coal, such as carbon capture and storage, coal bed methane recovery, and enhanced oil recovery.\n\n6. Summarize the advantages and limitations of Langmuir adsorption in coal, and any ongoing research in the field.\n\nRemember to keep your presentation simple and easy to understand, using clear graphics and examples to illustrate your points.
