The model exhibits the expected HP phenotype and is extremely similar to the environment caused by accidental damage to the parathyroid gland during surgery in patients. This rodent model can serve as an animal model for acquired HP. Prior to this, we attempted to use 5-ALA injected intraperitoneally and visualizing equipment intraoperatively (wavelength 410) to reveal the parathyroid, but the model was not satisfactory for the following reasons: 1) high mortality rate of the experimental animals due to drug toxicity and photosensitivity; 2) unclear intraoperative imaging, increasing surgical time. Therefore, we performed parathyroidectomy in mice by visual recognition and removal under the endoscopic microscope.\n\nOur most significant finding is that mice did not show post-operative compensation. However, many previous studies have reported that within 1-2 weeks post-surgery, serum PTH levels gradually increased to 80% of pre-operative levels, and even some mice showed a return to pre-operative serum PTH levels. In contrast, our study found that postoperative PTH levels did not rebound after 5 and 10 weeks post-surgery (Figure 2). We also discovered that the majority of mice did not have their parathyroid glands attached closely to the thyroid, and several mice had their parathyroid glands far from the thyroid; some even had three parathyroid glands. As a result, thyroidectomy might not have caused damage to the parathyroid glands. The studies that used thyroidectomy as a method make it difficult to rule out the possibility of incomplete removal of the parathyroid.\n\nAnother genetically modified mouse model involves the expression of diphtheria toxin (DT) receptors specifically in the parathyroid gland, rendering the parathyroid cells sensitive to diphtheria toxin. The parathyroid cells can be removed by injecting diphtheria toxin.
