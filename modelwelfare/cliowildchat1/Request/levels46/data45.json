Procrastination: Students tend to put off tasks, inevitably leading to cramming or completing assignments at the last minute. Procrastination can be resolved with effective time management strategies such as breaking tasks into smaller, manageable pieces, setting realistic goals, and rewarding oneself upon the completion of each task.\n\n2. Poor Time Management: Between coursework, extracurricular activities, and personal commitments, students may struggle to balance their responsibilities. To address poor time management, learners can create daily schedules, prioritize tasks, and learn to delegate non-essential activities.\n\n3. Lack of Motivation: Students can struggle with motivation when they are not passionate about a subject or lack a clear sense of purpose. To reignite motivation, students should set clear goals, find a personal connection to their studies, and celebrate small accomplishments.\n\n4. Test Anxiety: Many students suffer anxiety before or during exams, negatively impacting their performance. Addressing test anxiety involves practicing relaxation techniques, focusing on task-related thoughts, and simulating real exam conditions during practice sessions.\n\n5. Distractions: Social media, cellphones, and noisy environments can hinder learning. To minimize distractions, students should find quiet and comfortable places to study, establish boundaries, and incorporate regular breaks.\n\n6. Poor Note Taking Skills: Inefficient note taking can lead to students missing crucial information needed for success. Students should develop a note taking system that works for them, such as utilizing shorthand or bullet points, and focus on capturing key information during lectures.\n\n7. Difficulty Retaining Information: Students may struggle to remember the information they've learned. To improve retention, learners should utilize various memory techniques like mnemonic devices, spaced repetition, and active recall.\n\n8. Ineffective Study Techniques: Not all study methods are equally effective for every individual. Students should experiment with different strategies, such as mind-mapping, summarizing, or teaching the material to someone else, to identify what works best for them.\n\n9. Lack of Concentration: It's not uncommon for students to struggle with focusing on their materials. To improve concentration, students can engage in regular physical activity, create a consistent study routine, and practice mindfulness meditation.\n\n10. Difficulty Understanding Complex Topics: Sometimes, assignments or readings may seem confusing or overwhelming. In these instances, students should break down the material into smaller sections, consult supplementary resources, and reach out to professors or tutors for clarification.\n\n11. Unbalanced Lifestyle: A lack of sleep, exercise, and proper nutrition can negatively impact learning. Students should prioritize self-care by adopting a healthy lifestyle, which includes getting enough rest, regular physical activity, and proper nutrition.\n\n12. Perfectionism: Setting unrealistic expectations can hinder learning and increase stress levels. Students should learn to embrace imperfection and focus on progress rather than perfection.\n\n13. Inadequate Feedback: In some cases, students may not receive constructive feedback on their work. Learners should seek out additional sources of feedback from peers, tutors, or online communities to continue their growth and development.\n\n14. Imposter Syndrome: Many students question their own abilities and feel fraudulent in their academic achievements. Overcoming imposter syndrome requires acknowledging accomplishments, accepting weaknesses, and seeking support from mentors or peers.\n\n15. Fear of Failure: Fear of failure can hold students back from taking risks and attempting new challenges. Students should change their mindset and view failure as an opportunity for growth and learning.\n\n16. Poor Organization: Disorganization can make it difficult for students to keep up with coursework and deadlines. Implementing organizational systems, such as keeping an updated calendar and organizing materials, can significantly improve academic performance.\n\n17. Inability to Apply Knowledge: Students may struggle with applying theoretical information to real-world situations. Participating in group projects, internships, or clubs related to their field of study can help bridge the gap between theory and practice.\n\n18. Sleep Deprivation: A lack of sleep can hinder cognitive functioning and learning. Students should prioritize sleep by establishing a regular sleep schedule, creating a conducive sleep environment, and avoiding screen time before bed.\n\n19. Social Isolation: Students who do not feel connected to their peers or academic community may struggle to stay engaged in their studies. Joining clubs, study groups, or participating in campus events can help foster a sense of belonging.\n\n20. Financial Stress: Worries about tuition, living expenses, and student loan debt can distract from academic goals. Students should explore financial aid options, create realistic budgets, and seek part-time job opportunities or internships to alleviate financial stress."}]}, {"facetValue": "act as a proficient SEO writer, rewriting content about Rank Math in a human-like style, specifically divided into seven parts with detailed instructions and tips for website owners and developers.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "act as a proficient SEO writer, rewriting content about Rank Math in a human-like style, specifically divided into seven parts with detailed instructions and tips for website owners and developers."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "rewrite and guide through the process of setting up and using the Rank Math SEO plugin for WordPress."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "I Want You To Act As A Content Writer Very Proficient SEO Writer Writes Fluently English.

With so many options out there, it can be challenging to pick one that suits your needs perfectly. Today, let's dive into a robust comparison between Rank Math and some of its top competitors to help you make an informed decision.\n\nTo kick off our battle of the SEO titans, let's introduce our contestants: Rank Math, Yoast SEO, and All in One SEO Pack. All three are highly popular choices, but each has its unique strengths and weaknesses.\n\nFirst up: Rank Math. Did you know that it has been dubbed the \"Swiss Army Knife\" of SEO plugins? And for a good reason! Rank Math comes packed with nifty features, even in its free version. From on-page optimization and keyword suggestions to AMP support and social media integration, this plugin is truly versatile. Need even more functionality? The Pro version offers advanced schema support, WooCommerce SEO, and more.\n\nNext up is the ever-popular Yoast SEO. Like a reliable friend you can count on, Yoast has been around for ages, boasting a massive user base. Its user-friendly interface and comprehensive content analysis functions make it a solid option, especially for beginners. The drawback? Some key features, such as multiple keyword focus and redirection support, are locked behind a premium subscription.\n\nFinally, let's talk about the All in One SEO Pack. As the name suggests, this plugin aims to provide a comprehensive solution for your website's optimization needs. It comes with crucial features like XML sitemaps, robot.txt generation, and social media integration. While it gets the job done, it may not go that extra mile when compared to its counterparts in terms of advanced features.\n\nNow that we've met our contenders, which aspects should you consider when choosing your champion? Let's examine three important factors: ease of use, features, and pricing.\n\nWhen it comes to ease of use, Rank Math and Yoast SEO are neck-and-neck. Both plugins offer an intuitive interface, making them suitable for SEO newbies and pros alike. The setup wizards in both plugins guide users step-by-step through the configuration process. All in One SEO Pack, on the other hand, could be somewhat less user-friendly depending on your experience level.\n\nIn terms of features, all three plugins bring essential functionalities to the table, like on-page optimization and social media metadata. Rank Math really takes the cake here, allowing users to optimize their content for up to five focus keywords in the free version. Additionally, its integration with Google Search Console and other SEO analysis tools gives it a competitive edge.\n\nFinally, let's talk about the elephant in the room: pricing. All three plugins offer free versions with varying feature sets, making them accessible to everyone. However, if it's advanced functionality you're after, you might need to cough up some cash. Rank Math's pro version is priced competitively at $59 per year, significantly cheaper than Yoast SEO's premium option ($99 per year). Keep in mind, however, that these prices may change, so it's wise to consult the plugin websites for up-to-date information.\n\nSo, which plugin should you crown as the king of SEO? The answer ultimately depends on your needs and preferences. Rank Math offers a fantastic blend of affordability and functionality, making it a top choice for many users. However, if you're just starting with SEO, Yoast may be more accessible with its beginner-friendly interface. Meanwhile, All in One SEO Pack could be a suitable fit if you value simplicity and basic features above all else.\n\nNo matter which plugin you choose, remember that good SEO is a marathon, not a sprint.

Now write an article using the following transcript:  rank math\ndashboard as you can see these are all\nthe functions that you have on the free\nversion of rank math and depending on\nwhat you toggle on these features will\nappear in the settings for example if\nyou click on the general settings\ntake note that these are the available\nsettings we have after going through the\nsetup wizard and if we go back to the\ndashboard\nand we maybe toggle this image seo\nsettings on let's go back to the general\nsettings\nyou will see this images tab here where\nyou can configure all the settings for\nimages before we toggle the image seo on\nthere wasn't an images tab now let's go\nthrough each of these settings here for\nanalytics i will leave this towards the\nend of the video let's start with the\nLinks Configuration\ngeneral settings and links strip\ncategory base for newer sites if this is\nnot turned on i would recommend to just\nleave it as it is this is an\nirreversible action what it basically\nmeans is by default if your article is\ncategorized under a certain category the\nurl will look like this you have your\ndomain name the category for which your\narticle is categorized and then your\narticle name if you toggle this on it\nwill remove this category in between now\nif you turn this on and you suddenly\ndecide to turn it back off you are going\nto have tons of 404s if you have\nhundreds or thousands of articles so if\nthis is not turned on i'll leave it as\nit is but if it's already turned on on\nyour site don't turn it off to my\nknowledge it doesn't matter if you turn\nit on or turn it off it has no impact on\nseo whatsoever now a lot of these\noptions we have already touched based on\nthem in the setup wizard so we're gonna\nleave them as it is\nBreadcrumbs Configuration\nas for the breadcrumbs it is essentially\na trail of page links that leads to the\npage you are on for example something\nlike this you're on this page but these\nare all the previous pages that will\nlead to this page it is generally a good\nseo practice to have it but a\ncomplicated part is some teams already\nhave this functionality and if it's\nalready turned on then on rank math you\nshouldn't turn it on to cause conflict\nand some teams are not compatible with\nbreadcrumbs and turning this on it might\nbreak the site so i will not be talking\nabout this if you really want to turn\nthis on then make sure that you save a\nbackup copy of your site before turning\nImage SEO Configuration\nthis on next let's go to the image seo\nwe have just turned on i would recommend\nturning this on you know sometimes when\nwe add an image to an article we forgot\nto add an alt text here and what it does\nis it tells google what your image is\nabout have you ever used google to\nsearch for images having an alt text\nallows you to rank for keywords in the\nimage search and it boosts general seo\nas well so all images should have an alt\nattribute if you forgot to add one rank\nmath will take care of it for you if you\ntoggle this on and as for the missing\ntitle attribute i think this is kind of\nredundant because nowadays when you add\nan image to your site it comes with a\ntitle next we have the webmaster tools\nWebmaster Tools - Connecting Rank Math to Search Console\nthis is a useful tool for you to connect\nyour site to google search console and\nrankmath has made it easy for us we\ndon't have to go through the dns method\nor adding codes to your hit tag if you\ndon't know where to get this\nverification code of your search console\njust click on this\ncopy this entire code go back to rank\nmath and paste the entire code in and as\nyou save this\nwe are basically done now the only thing\nis to go back to the webmaster central\nand verify\nand we are done it's that simple\nyou can go through the process for\nothers as well if you want faster\nrankings of your article on these search\nengines i'll leave it up to you to go\nthrough the process now the robots.txt\nRobots.txt\ni'll recommend that you leave this as it\nis generally this will tell google\ncrawlers whether they should or should\nnot cross certain parts of your site\nmessing with this might cause your\nranking so don't do it as for others we\nOthers - RSS\ndon't really need to add anything to\nthis i don't even know if anybody uses\nrss anymore on their sites we have\nsocial media channels like tik tok\npinterest facebook instagram to get our\ndaily feeds so it will be more effective\nif you post your articles on those\nchannels rather than have them on your\nsite generally rss is just a medium for\nyou to notify your site visitors as\nsomething new has been published on your\nsite it used to be very popular back in\nthe day but nowadays i don't see anybody\nusing rss anymore they usually go to\nsocial media sites to get updates so\ni'll rather you update your followers\nthrough social media channels or email\nmarketing than rss feeds so we'll skip\nthis we'll talk about woocommerce in a\nHTAccess\nwhile now as for htss we will not make\nany changes to this because if you mess\naround with the codes it may break your\nwebsite so i will not do anything to\nthis let's go to 404 monitor again\n404 Monitor Configuration\nnothing much to adjust 404 monitor as\ni've mentioned it will notify you when\nyou have pages that were previously\nindexed on search engines but those\npages don't exist anymore so i'll not do\nanything to this let's go to\nRedirection Configuration - Selecting Redirection Type\nredirections now redirection is usually\nused when you delete a page or change\nthe permalink structure and for such\ncases we'll leave it as 301 permanent\nmove now let me explain a little more\nabout these options for 302 i recommend\nnot to use it as it is vague if you need\na temporary redirect where you still\nneed the original url later on for\nexample if you are building a page that\nis still under construction you will\nwant to use 307 instead of 302 when the\npage is completed you will remove the\n307. if ever your content is removed do\nnot use 410 just use 301 instead because\nit is most recognizable and if ever you\nare unlucky that your content needs to\nbe taken down by court order then you\nwill need to use 451 let's hope we never\nuse this so by default we'll keep it as\n301 but if you visit the redirections\ntab and you edit any link\nyou can amend the redirection type\nso we are basically done with the\ngeneral settings now let's go to titles\nTitles & Meta\nand meta as for the global meta we want\nGlobal Meta Configuration\nthe robot's meta to be indexed so all of\nour content and stuff will be indexed by\nsearch engines the advanced robots meta\nwe want to keep it as it is negative one\nbasically tells google that you can use\nall the content on the article to be\nused as a snippet or they can use all\nthe content in the video as a preview so\nthere are no restrictions however if you\nin fact change this number you are\nrestricting google crawlers so generally\nwe want to leave this as negative one\nthis is done on the setup wizard and as\nfor the separator character this is by\npreference just take a look at the\nsymbol here as i change the separators\nyou basically change the look of it on\nsearch results personally i like this\nand if you want to capitalize the first\ncharacter of all title tags you can do\nso by toggling this on i choose to leave\nit to give me more flexibility\nand if you want to add a fallback image\nto be displayed on facebook in case you\nforgot to add a featured image you can\ndo so here and this is self-explanatory\nLocal SEO Configuration\nalright let's go to local seo as you\nknow these are the information we have\ndone on the setup wizard but this is\nespecially important for local\nbusinesses and there are more settings\nhere if you toggle this on\nlet's go back to the page and refresh\nand you'll see there are a lot more\ndetails you can add you can add your\nemail address your business address your\nbusiness type which was set in the setup\nwizard you can add the opening hours\ndesign on the time format\nyour phone number price range set your\nabout page contact page google maps if\nyou don't know the api key just click on\nthis link to get it and if you know the\ncoordinates of your business location\nyou can add it here so these are all the\ninformation you can give to google so\nthat they can display something like\nthis on their search results in case\npeople are searching for your business\nthey will know the opening hours and how\nto contact you these are important\ninformation for your customers so please\ndon't neglect this for local businesses\nbut for my case this is a blog so i\nwon't be needing this let me toggle this\noff\nand let's hit\nrefresh and all those settings are gone\nSocial Meta Configuration\nas for the social meta this is for you\nto connect your facebook and twitter you\ncan add your facebook page url here for\nmy case this is the facebook page i'll\nleave all this as it is but feel free to\ngo through the links to get the user id\nthe app id and the secret id all this\nwill give you a very nice facebook post\ndisplay instead of the ugly looking ones\nlike this\nand then as for twitter you can add just\nthe username and that's it i don't have\na twitter account for this site so i'll\nleave it as it is now let's go to the\nOptimizing Home Page for SEO\nhome page\nessentially it is telling you to go to\nthe settings and under reading they want\nyou to define your home page and if you\nwant to optimize this page for seo you\nneed to go to that particular page\nfor my case it is this home page let's\nedit this\nand you want to optimize this page for\nseo so currently on the search result it\nwill look like this doesn't look really\nnice let's edit snippets and over here i\ndon't really care if the title is\nshowing so let me remove this and let me\nremove this as well\nand as for this separator let me cut\nthis off and let me paste it here and\nthen let me add something like the\ntagline\nso something like this now it'll look\nmuch better on search engine now this\nsite name you can basically find it on\nthe settings and general which is over\nhere\nthis code is actually drawing\ninformation from this view so if i\nchange the site title\nthis will change as well just take note\nof that and as for the description let\nme type something in\nso something like this\nlet's close this off and then as for the\nfocus keyword\nlet's just optimize for the brand name\nyou see over here it is recommending us\nto add echo tarot in the meta\ndescription so let's do that i've typed\nin some text so i'll place it here this\nis too long let us do something about\nthis\nand done\nlet us close this off and we see a\nlittle green tick here\nas for this\nlet us do something like this\nand we are basically done we are all\ngood let's update this\nand we have basically optimized the home\npage for seo now let's get back to the\nrank map dashboard and under titles and\nmeta let's continue on with the authors\nAuthor Archive Configuration\nnow if your site only has one author\nwhich is yourself then you want to\ndisable this but if your site has more\nthan one writer you need to enable this\nand to avoid duplicate content you\nshould put a note index on auto archives\nwhich rank mav has already done so by\ndefault\nnow we have gone through all this and\nthis is how it looks like on search\nresults for the author archive you can\nleave it as it is or you can change it\nto something like\narticles written by the author name\nwhich is symbolized by this and you can\nchange this to something like this\narticles written by author name of the\nsite name and then we have the page\nwhich is this and that's basically it\nlet's save changes and let's go to the\nMisc Pages\nmiscellaneous pages this is where you\ncustomize the date archives\nthe 404 page just like how you will\ncustomize the author archives this is\nhow the 404 looks like it really depends\non how you would want to display your\nphoto for i'll leave all this as it is\nbut you definitely want to toggle this\non in case you have any paid content on\nthe site you don't want those pages to\nbe indexed on search engines you want to\nkeep them private and then we're going\nto save changes\nPost Types - Posts\nnow the post types i think the default\nsettings from rankmath is good enough\nbut if you want to further customize it\nfor example if you want to add a current\nyear so that if you go to google for\nexample you have this 2021 in the seo\ntitle but if you take a look at this\nthis is written in 2019 so you can\nbasically display the current year in\nthe search results and the reason\nbloggers do this is because it gives the\nimpression that this article is current\nthis is debatable i see some big sites\ndoing this if you want to do this as\nwell on a single post title you can add\nfor example open and close brackets and\nwithin that\nlet's search for\ncurrent year\nthis is the code let's cut this and\npaste this inside the bracket now the\ntitle is too long so let me bring this\nforward so you can see how it looks like\nso it's something like this\nbut i want to put it right before the\nseparator now if you do this all your\nposts will now have this current year on\nthe search results but if you don't want\nto do that for all of your posts you\nshould remove this and you'll do the\nmanual customization here for example\nthis so let's continue i'll leave all\nthis as it is to give my articles more\nflexibility if i want to change the seo\ntitle and description i will go straight\nto the specific post and page to edit\nthe snippet instead of doing them here\nnow this schema type is done on the\nsetup wizard and the rest are quite\nstandard i'm sure you know what this is\nalready and as for the custom fields\nwe'll talk more about this in the\nwoocommerce section because we'll be\nswitching to another site as a reference\nnow there are a lot of seo strategies to\ntackle this you have probably hear a lot\nof people talking about this and there\nis really no right or wrong answer the\nkey is really to write the best content\nhave the best headline that attracts the\nright audience and that's the general\nrule of time for seo now as for the\nPost Types - Pages\npages\nit is going to be the same as well\ntypically i wouldn't add the year to\npages because usually they are static\nPost Types - Attachments\nand as for the attachments we have\nbasically set this in the seo wizard and\nPost Types - Elements\nfor the elements i use elements as\ndesign templates so i do not want this\nto be indexed so that's basically the\nsettings i will need and for the\nproducts they are basically the same all\nthese are quite standard and we have\ndiscussed about customizing this now\nPost Categories SEO Configuration\nlet's talk about categories i want to\nmake sure that categories are not\nindexed because it might cause google to\nview it as duplicate content so if you\ndo not have this turned on you want to\ndo so and you want to select no index\nthe same goes for text\ni want to put a no index to text and\nlet's save changes and we are basically\ndone with the titles and meta now let us\nAdding Sitemap to Google Search Console\nadd sitemaps sitemap is a guide for\ngoogle robots to navigate through your\nsite to easily find all the pages and\nposts and rankmath has created the\nsitemap for you and this is the link you\nneed to copy this and then you need to\ngo to google search console and you need\nto go to sitemaps and paste in the link\nyou need to remove all this\nand let's submit\nand great it is successful search\nconsole will tell you if the status is\nsuccessful and it will show you how many\npages of posts they have indexed and\nthere we go we are 95 done with the\noptimization the rest of the five\npercent comes from the customization of\nyour single post articles and all these\nwe have basically covered them earlier\nWooCommerce & ACF Configuration\nnow let's talk about woocommerce and\nthis acf now we are on my other side\nwhere i use it to do woocommerce\ntutorials you see i've created a single\nproduct template like this where all\nthis information are drawn from these\ncustom fields and these custom fields\nbasically came from a plugin called\nadvanced custom fields by delicious\nbrains and i've created this view group\nwhere all these custom fields will be\ndisplayed on products under the knife\ncategory you'll see all these fields\nright here in the single product page it\nsounds complicated but it's actually\nquite simple if you are curious how i\ncreated this single product template you\ncan watch this video at the top right\ncorner i've left the link in the\ndescription as well\nso basically if you toggle this\nwoocommerce feature on what it does is\non the single product page as you scroll\nall the way to the bottom you will see\nthis section where it says rank math seo\nand this is where you optimize this\nsingle product for search engines so for\nexample the focus keyword will be the\nname of the knife and now we have a\nscore of 54. now here's the interesting\nthing as you can see here content should\nbe 600 words to 2500 words which means\ncurrently all this content that i've\nwritten over here in the custom fields\nare not taken into account and rank math\nso what we need to do is to go back to\nthe rank map dashboard and over at this\nacf feature we need to turn this on and\nimmediately after that if we go back to\nthe single product page and we refresh\nnow as we scroll down all the way to\nwhere the rank math is\nyou will see now it has detected 74\nwords and these came from the custom\nfields\nand before we activated the acf feature\nrankmap did not pick up any content\nbecause the product description as well\nas the product shop description are\nbasically left blank so that's all we\nneed to know about acf and woocommerce\nin rankmath if you have activated the\nProduct Post Type Configuration\nwoocommerce feature you'll have this\nproduct post time here or you can\ncustomize the single product title\nand as you know the more customized this\nis the more restriction it's going to be\non your individual products so it's\nreally up to you whether you want to\nspend time customizing this i feel that\ntime will be better spent if you\noptimize for seo on the product page\nitself rather than here but this is just\nfor you to know you have all these\noptions to customize for your product\npost type and the other settings that\nProduct Categories & Tags Configuration\nare available when you have activated\nthe woocommerce feature as this product\ncategories that work similar to the post\ncategories and tags you can make the\nproduct categories no index and you can\ndo the same with product tags and that's\nwhat you basically need to know and now\nConnecting Rank Math to Google Analytics\nthere is one last thing we need to do\nwhich is to connect your website to\ngoogle analytics now we are back on the\neco tarot website and i've opened up my\ngoogle analytics and now let us connect\nthrough the usual way by clicking on\nthis button and let's select the google\nanalytics account\nyou want to check all these boxes and\nlet's continue\nand now the thing is as you can see the\nanalytics is not sync if they are in\nsync it will have a green dot here\ninstead of red so if we go to the\ngeneral settings and we select analytics\nwe can see over here under the account\nwe can select ecotaro and under the\nproperty we have no other options it's\nsupposed to show\nthe property here so how do we solve\nthis this is a very common issue if you\ndon't set up the property that allows\nuniversal data\nso let's go to admin\nand let's create a new property\nlet us give this property a name\nas for me i live in singapore so i'll\nrather have the data served to me in my\ntime zone currency i'll leave it as us\ndollars and you need to open this\nadvanced options up and over here you\ncan see universal analytics property\nlet's toggle this on\nnow over here\nyou want to put in your website url and\nmake sure you select this as well as\nchecking this box\nand let's click next\nselect an industry\nfor me i'll select home and garden and\nthe business size or select small but\nyou can select whatever that suits your\nbusiness and then i'll check whatever\nthat applies to my business\nincrease my conversion\nmeasure content monetization this as\nwell as this now let's create the\nproperty\nand here we go we are done let's go back\nto our site and let's refresh this\nlet us go back to analytics\nnow let's select an account and we have\nthe new property here let's select this\nand let's select all website data\nand let's save changes and once that's\ndone you can see this little dot has\nturned green and that's what you need to\ndo to connect to google analytics all\nyou need is just the universal analytics\ndata if you have an existing property\ncreate a new one it doesn't hurt now\noverall ranked math is a very powerful\nseo tool

Now create an outline using the following transcript: rank math\ndashboard as you can see these are all\nthe functions that you have on the free\nversion of rank math and depending on\nwhat you toggle on these features will\nappear in the settings for example if\nyou click on the general settings\ntake note that these are the available\nsettings we have after going through the\nsetup wizard and if we go back to the\ndashboard\nand we maybe toggle this image seo\nsettings on let's go back to the general\nsettings\nyou will see this images tab here where\nyou can configure all the settings for\nimages before we toggle the image seo on\nthere wasn't an images tab now let's go\nthrough each of these settings here for\nanalytics i will leave this towards the\nend of the video let's start with the\nLinks Configuration\ngeneral settings and links strip\ncategory base for newer sites if this is\nnot turned on i would recommend to just\nleave it as it is this is an\nirreversible action what it basically\nmeans is by default if your article is\ncategorized under a certain category the\nurl will look like this you have your\ndomain name the category for which your\narticle is categorized and then your\narticle name if you toggle this on it\nwill remove this category in between now\nif you turn this on and you suddenly\ndecide to turn it back off you are going\nto have tons of 404s if you have\nhundreds or thousands of articles so if\nthis is not turned on i'll leave it as\nit is but if it's already turned on on\nyour site don't turn it off to my\nknowledge it doesn't matter if you turn\nit on or turn it off it has no impact on\nseo whatsoever now a lot of these\noptions we have already touched based on\nthem in the setup wizard so we're gonna\nleave them as it is\nBreadcrumbs Configuration\nas for the breadcrumbs it is essentially\na trail of page links that leads to the\npage you are on for example something\nlike this you're on this page but these\nare all the previous pages that will\nlead to this page it is generally a good\nseo practice to have it but a\ncomplicated part is some teams already\nhave this functionality and if it's\nalready turned on then on rank math you\nshouldn't turn it on to cause conflict\nand some teams are not compatible with\nbreadcrumbs and turning this on it might\nbreak the site so i will not be talking\nabout this if you really want to turn\nthis on then make sure that you save a\nbackup copy of your site before turning\nImage SEO Configuration\nthis on next let's go to the image seo\nwe have just turned on i would recommend\nturning this on you know sometimes when\nwe add an image to an article we forgot\nto add an alt text here and what it does\nis it tells google what your image is\nabout have you ever used google to\nsearch for images having an alt text\nallows you to rank for keywords in the\nimage search and it boosts general seo\nas well so all images should have an alt\nattribute if you forgot to add one rank\nmath will take care of it for you if you\ntoggle this on and as for the missing\ntitle attribute i think this is kind of\nredundant because nowadays when you add\nan image to your site it comes with a\ntitle next we have the webmaster tools\nWebmaster Tools - Connecting Rank Math to Search Console\nthis is a useful tool for you to connect\nyour site to google search console and\nrankmath has made it easy for us we\ndon't have to go through the dns method\nor adding codes to your hit tag if you\ndon't know where to get this\nverification code of your search console\njust click on this\ncopy this entire code go back to rank\nmath and paste the entire code in and as\nyou save this\nwe are basically done now the only thing\nis to go back to the webmaster central\nand verify\nand we are done it's that simple\nyou can go through the process for\nothers as well if you want faster\nrankings of your article on these search\nengines i'll leave it up to you to go\nthrough the process now the robots.txt\nRobots.txt\ni'll recommend that you leave this as it\nis generally this will tell google\ncrawlers whether they should or should\nnot cross certain parts of your site\nmessing with this might cause your\nranking so don't do it as for others we\nOthers - RSS\ndon't really need to add anything to\nthis i don't even know if anybody uses\nrss anymore on their sites we have\nsocial media channels like tik tok\npinterest facebook instagram to get our\ndaily feeds so it will be more effective\nif you post your articles on those\nchannels rather than have them on your\nsite generally rss is just a medium for\nyou to notify your site visitors as\nsomething new has been published on your\nsite it used to be very popular back in\nthe day but nowadays i don't see anybody\nusing rss anymore they usually go to\nsocial media sites to get updates so\ni'll rather you update your followers\nthrough social media channels or email\nmarketing than rss feeds so we'll skip\nthis we'll talk about woocommerce in a\nHTAccess\nwhile now as for htss we will not make\nany changes to this because if you mess\naround with the codes it may break your\nwebsite so i will not do anything to\nthis let's go to 404 monitor again\n404 Monitor Configuration\nnothing much to adjust 404 monitor as\ni've mentioned it will notify you when\nyou have pages that were previously\nindexed on search engines but those\npages don't exist anymore so i'll not do\nanything to this let's go to\nRedirection Configuration - Selecting Redirection Type\nredirections now redirection is usually\nused when you delete a page or change\nthe permalink structure and for such\ncases we'll leave it as 301 permanent\nmove now let me explain a little more\nabout these options for 302 i recommend\nnot to use it as it is vague if you need\na temporary redirect where you still\nneed the original url later on for\nexample if you are building a page that\nis still under construction you will\nwant to use 307 instead of 302 when the\npage is completed you will remove the\n307. if ever your content is removed do\nnot use 410 just use 301 instead because\nit is most recognizable and if ever you\nare unlucky that your content needs to\nbe taken down by court order then you\nwill need to use 451 let's hope we never\nuse this so by default we'll keep it as\n301 but if you visit the redirections\ntab and you edit any link\nyou can amend the redirection type\nso we are basically done with the\ngeneral settings now let's go to titles\nTitles & Meta\nand meta as for the global meta we want\nGlobal Meta Configuration\nthe robot's meta to be indexed so all of\nour content and stuff will be indexed by\nsearch engines the advanced robots meta\nwe want to keep it as it is negative one\nbasically tells google that you can use\nall the content on the article to be\nused as a snippet or they can use all\nthe content in the video as a preview so\nthere are no restrictions however if you\nin fact change this number you are\nrestricting google crawlers so generally\nwe want to leave this as negative one\nthis is done on the setup wizard and as\nfor the separator character this is by\npreference just take a look at the\nsymbol here as i change the separators\nyou basically change the look of it on\nsearch results personally i like this\nand if you want to capitalize the first\ncharacter of all title tags you can do\nso by toggling this on i choose to leave\nit to give me more flexibility\nand if you want to add a fallback image\nto be displayed on facebook in case you\nforgot to add a featured image you can\ndo so here and this is self-explanatory\nLocal SEO Configuration\nalright let's go to local seo as you\nknow these are the information we have\ndone on the setup wizard but this is\nespecially important for local\nbusinesses and there are more settings\nhere if you toggle this on\nlet's go back to the page and refresh\nand you'll see there are a lot more\ndetails you can add you can add your\nemail address your business address your\nbusiness type which was set in the setup\nwizard you can add the opening hours\ndesign on the time format\nyour phone number price range set your\nabout page contact page google maps if\nyou don't know the api key just click on\nthis link to get it and if you know the\ncoordinates of your business location\nyou can add it here so these are all the\ninformation you can give to google so\nthat they can display something like\nthis on their search results in case\npeople are searching for your business\nthey will know the opening hours and how\nto contact you these are important\ninformation for your customers so please\ndon't neglect this for local businesses\nbut for my case this is a blog so i\nwon't be needing this let me toggle this\noff\nand let's hit\nrefresh and all those settings are gone\nSocial Meta Configuration\nas for the social meta this is for you\nto connect your facebook and twitter you\ncan add your facebook page url here for\nmy case this is the facebook page i'll\nleave all this as it is but feel free to\ngo through the links to get the user id\nthe app id and the secret id all this\nwill give you a very nice facebook post\ndisplay instead of the ugly looking ones\nlike this\nand then as for twitter you can add just\nthe username and that's it i don't have\na twitter account for this site so i'll\nleave it as it is now let's go to the\nOptimizing Home Page for SEO\nhome page\nessentially it is telling you to go to\nthe settings and under reading they want\nyou to define your home page and if you\nwant to optimize this page for seo you\nneed to go to that particular page\nfor my case it is this home page let's\nedit this\nand you want to optimize this page for\nseo so currently on the search result it\nwill look like this doesn't look really\nnice let's edit snippets and over here i\ndon't really care if the title is\nshowing so let me remove this and let me\nremove this as well\nand as for this separator let me cut\nthis off and let me paste it here and\nthen let me add something like the\ntagline\nso something like this now it'll look\nmuch better on search engine now this\nsite name you can basically find it on\nthe settings and general which is over\nhere\nthis code is actually drawing\ninformation from this view so if i\nchange the site title\nthis will change as well just take note\nof that and as for the description let\nme type something in\nso something like this\nlet's close this off and then as for the\nfocus keyword\nlet's just optimize for the brand name\nyou see over here it is recommending us\nto add echo tarot in the meta\ndescription so let's do that i've typed\nin some text so i'll place it here this\nis too long let us do something about\nthis\nand done\nlet us close this off and we see a\nlittle green tick here\nas for this\nlet us do something like this\nand we are basically done we are all\ngood let's update this\nand we have basically optimized the home\npage for seo now let's get back to the\nrank map dashboard and under titles and\nmeta let's continue on with the authors\nAuthor Archive Configuration\nnow if your site only has one author\nwhich is yourself then you want to\ndisable this but if your site has more\nthan one writer you need to enable this\nand to avoid duplicate content you\nshould put a note index on auto archives\nwhich rank mav has already done so by\ndefault\nnow we have gone through all this and\nthis is how it looks like on search\nresults for the

is where you\ncustomize the date archives\nthe 404 page just like how you will\ncustomize the author archives this is\nhow the 404 looks like it really depends\non how you would want to display your\nphoto for i'll leave all this as it is\nbut you definitely want to toggle this\non in case you have any paid content on\nthe site you don't want those pages to\nbe indexed on search engines you want to\nkeep them private and then we're going\nto save changes\nPost Types - Posts\nnow the post types i think the default\nsettings from rankmath is good enough\nbut if you want to further customize it\nfor example if you want to add a current\nyear so that if you go to google for\nexample you have this 2021 in the seo\ntitle but if you take a look at this\nthis is written in 2019 so you can\nbasically display the current year in\nthe search results and the reason\nbloggers do this is because it gives the\nimpression that this article is current\nthis is debatable i see some big sites\ndoing this if you want to do this as\nwell on a single post title you can add\nfor example open and close brackets and\nwithin that\nlet's search for\ncurrent year\nthis is the code let's cut

we are basically\ndone with the titles and meta now let us\nAdding Sitemap to Google Search Console\nadd sitemaps sitemap is a guide for\ngoogle robots to navigate through your\nsite to easily find all the pages and\nposts and rankmath has created the\nsitemap for you and this is the link you\nneed to copy this and then you need to\ngo to google search console and you need\nto go to sitemaps and paste in the link\nyou need to remove all this\nand let's submit\nand great it is successful search\nconsole will tell you if the status is\nsuccessful and it will show you how many\npages of posts they have indexed and\nthere we go we are 95 done with the\noptimization the rest of the five\npercent comes from the customization of\nyour single post articles and all these\nwe have basically covered them earlier\nWooCommerce & ACF Configuration\nnow let's talk about woocommerce and\nthis acf now we are on my other side\nwhere i use it to do woocommerce\ntutorials you see i've created a single\nproduct template like this where all\nthis information are drawn from these\ncustom fields and these custom fields\nbasically came from a plugin called\nadvanced custom fields by delicious\nbrains and i've created this view group\nwhere all these custom fields will be\ndisplayed on products under the knife\ncategory you'll see all these fields\nright here in the single product page it\nsounds complicated but it's actually\nquite simple if you are curious how i\ncreated this single product template you\ncan watch this video at the top right\ncorner i've left the link in the\ndescription as well\nso basically if you toggle this\nwoocommerce feature on what it does is\non the single product page as you scroll\nall the way to the bottom you will see\nthis section where it says rank math seo\nand this is where you optimize this\nsingle product for search engines so for\nexample the focus keyword will be the\nname of the knife and now we have a\nscore of 54. now here's the interesting\nthing as you can see here content should\nbe 600 words to 2500 words which means\ncurrently all this content that i've\nwritten over here in the custom fields\nare not taken into account and rank math\nso what we need to do is to go back to\nthe rank map dashboard and over at this\nacf feature we need to turn this on and\nimmediately after that if we go back to\nthe single product page and we refresh\nnow as we scroll down all the way to\nwhere the rank math is\nyou will see now it has detected 74\nwords and these came from the custom\nfields\nand before we activated the acf feature\nrankmap did not pick up any content\nbecause the product description as well\nas the product shop description are\nbasically left blank so that's all we\nneed to know about acf and woocommerce\nin rankmath if you have activated the\nProduct Post Type Configuration\nwoocommerce feature you'll have this\nproduct post time here or you can\ncustomize the single product title\nand as you know the more customized this\nis the more restriction it's going to be\non your individual products so it's\nreally up to you whether you want to\nspend time customizing this i feel that\ntime will be better spent if you\noptimize for seo on the product page\nitself rather than here but this is just\nfor you to know you have all these\noptions to customize for your product\npost type and the other settings that\nProduct Categories & Tags Configuration\nare available when you have activated\nthe woocommerce feature as this product\ncategories that work similar to the post\ncategories and tags you can make the\nproduct categories no index and you can\ndo the same with product tags and that's\nwhat you basically need to know and now\nConnecting Rank Math to Google Analytics\nthere is one last thing we need to do\nwhich is to connect your website to\ngoogle analytics now we are back on the\neco tarot website and i've opened up my\ngoogle analytics and now let us connect\nthrough the usual way by clicking on\nthis button and let's select the google\nanalytics account\nyou want to check all these boxes and\nlet's continue\nand now the thing is as you can see the\nanalytics is not sync if they are in\nsync it will have a green dot here\ninstead of red so if we go to the\ngeneral settings and we select analytics\nwe can see over here under the account\nwe can select ecotaro and under the\nproperty we have no other options it's\nsupposed to show\nthe property here so how do we solve\nthis this is a very common issue if you\ndon't set up the property that allows\nuniversal data\nso let's go to admin\nand let's create a new property\nlet us give this property a name\nas for me i live in singapore so i'll\nrather have the data served to me in my\ntime zone currency i'll leave it as us\ndollars and you need to open this\nadvanced options up and over here you\ncan see universal analytics property\nlet's toggle this on\nnow over here\nyou want to put in your website url and\nmake sure you select this as well as\nchecking this box\nand let's click next\nselect an industry\nfor me i'll select home and garden and\nthe business size or select small but\nyou can select whatever that suits your\nbusiness and then i'll check whatever\nthat applies to my business\nincrease my conversion\nmeasure content monetization this as\nwell as this now let's create the\nproperty\nand here we go we are done let's go back\nto our site and let's refresh this\nlet us go back to analytics\nnow let's select an account and we have\nthe new property here let's select this\nand let's select all website data\nand let's save changes and once that's\ndone you can see this little dot has\nturned green and that's what you need to\ndo to

This began when Chess.com created their first PogChamps tournament on Twitch in 2020, which proved extremely popular thanks to thanks to streamers like Grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura, xQc, and Ludwig. The tournament has gone from strength to strength since, with celebrities outside of Twitch like Gregor Clegane and Rainn Wilson competing in the tournament since.\n\nRELATED:\nCommon Mistakes New Players Need To Avoid\n\nFurthermore, Netflix's hit series The Queen's Gambit spurred another wave of interest, which gave sites like Chess.com, Chess24, and Lichess huge increases in their player count. To help players who are new to the game, we've listed some of the best openings to get started with.\n\nNotations showing how the pictured games were reached will be on the right-hand side of each picture. For those who are yet to learn chess notation, a handy guide can be found here.\n\nUpdated on March 16th, 2023, by Jack Pursey: Studying new openings can be a daunting task for newcomers to chess. Entire books have been written on chess openings, and many Grandmasters are still learning something new every day about opening patterns that have been around for centuries. However, learning new openings can also be great fun and is incredibly rewarding, as understanding even the basic principles of a handful of openings can significantly improve a beginner's game. To give newcomers to chess some more help, we've expanded this list of the best chess openings with some more useful information.\n\n\n\n1\nScotch Game\nScotch Game on an online Chess board\nThe Scotch Game is an alternative to the popular Ruy Lopez system. The opening's main benefit is that it quickly gives White plenty of space, particularly for their two bishops, which are both given open diagonals.\n\nThe opening isn't without its issues, as it swiftly releases the tension and can make White's e4 pawn vulnerable later in the game. Still, it's a great opening to learn for those who want to gain early space and avoid all of the theory that comes with playing the Ruy Lopez.\n\nExample Game To Study\nKasparov, Garry vs Karpov, Anatoly (1990)\n\n1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nxc6 bxc6 6.e5 Qe7 7.Qe2 Nd5 8.c4 Nb6 9.Nd2 Qe6 10.b3 a5 11.Bb2 Bb4 12.a3 Bxd2+ 13.Qxd2 d5 14.cxd5 cxd5 15.Rc1 O-O 16.Rxc7 Qg6 17.f3 Bf5 18.g4 Bb1 19.Bb5 Rac8 20.Rxc8 Rxc8 21.O-O h5 22.h3 hxg4 23.hxg4 Bc2 24.Qd4 Qe6 25.Rf2 Rc7 26.Rh2 Nd7 27.b4 axb4 28.axb4 Nf8 29.Bf1 Bb3 30.Bd3 Bc4 31.Bf5 Qe7 32.Qd2 Rc6 33.Bd4 Ra6 34.Bb1 Ra3 35.Rh3 Rb3 36.Bc2 Qxb4 37.Qf2 Ng6 38.e6 Rb1+ 39.Bxb1 Qxb1+ 40.Kh2 fxe6 41.Qb2 Qxb2+ 42.Bxb2 Nf4 43.Rh4 Nd3 44.Bc3 e5 45.Kg3 d4 46.Bd2 Bd5 47.Rh5 Kf7 48.Ba5 Ke6 49.Rh8 Nb2 50.Re8+ Kd6 51.Bb4+ Kc6 52.Rc8+ Kd7 53.Rc5 Ke6 54.Rc7 g6 55.Re7+ Kf6 56.Rd7 Ba2 57.Ra7 Bc4 58.Ba5 Bd3 59.f4 exf4+ 60.Kxf4 Bc2 61.Ra6+ Kf7 62.Ke5 Nd3+ 63.Kxd4 Nf2 64.g5 Bf5 65.Bd2 Ke7 66.Kd5 Ne4 67.Ra7+ Ke8 68.Be3 Nc3+ 69.Ke5 Kd8 70.Bb6+ Ke8 71.Rc7 Ne4 72.Be3 Ng3 73.Bf4 Nh5 74.Ra7 Kf8 75.Bh2 Ng7 76.Bg1 Nh5 77.Bc5+ Kg8 78.Kd6 Kf8 79.Bd4 Bg4 80.Be5 Bf5 81.Rh7 Kg8 82.Rc7 Kf8 83.Kc6 Kg8 84.Re7 Kf8 85.Bd6 Kg8 86.Re8+ Kf7 87.Re7+ Kg8 88.Be5 Kf8 89.Ra7 Bg4 90.Kd6 Bh3 91.Ra3 Bg4 92.Re3 Bf5 93.Kc7 Kf7 94.Kd8 Bg4 95.Bb2 Be6 96.Bc3 Bf5 97.Re7+ Kf8 98.Be5 Bd3 99.Ra7 Be4 100.Rc7 Bb1 101.Bd6+ Kg8 102.Ke7 1-0\n\n2\nItalian Game\nitalian game chess opening on 2d board\nThe Italian Game is believed to have originated in the 15th century, making it one of the oldest openings still commonly used today. White and Black both get some control of the center and open up space for their queen and bishop with the e pawn push. Both develop their knights as Black defends the e5 pawn that White is threatening.\n\nRELATED:\nBest Chess Video Games\n\nThe move Bc4 has multiple purposes. It puts pressure on Black's weak f7 square, develops a minor piece, helps control the center of the board, and allows White to castle on their next move. When playing as Black and in this position, be wary of the move Ng5, which sees White threaten to take the f7 pawn, forking the queen and rook. This is known as the Fried Liver Attack.\n\nExample Game To Study\nLoyd, Samuel vs Rosenthal, Samuel (1867)\n\n1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.d3 Nf6 5.Be3 Bb6 6.Nc3 d6 7.h3 Na5 8.Bb3 Nxb3 9.axb3 Be6 10.Nb5 Bxe3 11.fxe3 c6 12.Nc3 Qc7 13.g4 a6 14.d4 O-O-O 15.d5 Bd7 16.g5 Ne8 17.Nd2 c5 18.Nc4 h6 19.Qh5 Rf8 20.gxh6 Rh8 21.hxg7 Rxh5 22.g8=Q Rxh3 23.Rxh3 Bxh3 24.Nb5 Qe7 25.Qh7 Bg4 26.Na7+ Kb8 27.Rxa6 Nc7 28.Ra5 Qf6 29.Qh1 Rh8 30.Qf1 Bf3 31.Nb6 Qh4+ 32.Kd2 Qg4 33.Qxf3 Qxf3 34.Nd7+ Ka8 35.Nc6+ Na6 36.Nb6# 1-0\n\n\n3\nRuy Lopez\nruy lopez chess opening on 2d board\nThe Ruy Lopez is similar to the Italian Game, but with the bishop on B5 instead of C5. Like the Italian Game, it's a solid opening as White has good control of the center with their pawn and knight and can castle with their next turn. The most common response for White in this position is a6, forcing White to decide what to do with their bishop. It may seem tempting to take the knight as it doubles Black's pawns. However, this is a dubious strategy as, generally speaking, bishops are slightly better than knights.\n\nIt may seem that if Black plays a6, White can take Black's knight, then capture the hanging pawn on e5 with their knight once it recaptures the bishop. However, this would allow Black to play either Qe7 or Qg5, causing problems for White.\n\nExample Game To Study\nKasparov, Garry vs Smyslov, Vassily (1981)\n\n1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 g6 5.d4 exd4 6.c3 Bg7 7.cxd4 b5 8.Bc2 d6 9.d5 Ne5 10.Nxe5 dxe5 11.a4 Bd7 12.Be3 Nf6 13.O-O O-O 14.Qd2 Ne8 15.Bc5 Nd6 16.axb5 Bxb5 17.Re1 Qd7 18.Nc3 Rfb8 19.b4 Bf8 20.Qg5 Qe7 21.Qe3 Qf6 22.Bd3 Bxd3 23.Qxd3 Nb5 24.Nxb5 axb5 25.Rxa8 Rxa8 26.Qxb5 Qa6 27.Qxa6 Rxa6 28.g4 Bd6 29.b5 Ra8 30.Bxd6 cxd6 31.b6 Rb8 32.Rb1 Kf8 33.Kf1 Ke7 34.Ke2 g5 35.Kd3 Kd7 36.Kc4 Rc8+ 37.Kb5 Rc2 38.Ra1 Rb2+ 39.Ka6 1-0\n\n\n4\nNimzowitsch-Larsen Attack\nNimzowitsch Larsen Attack on an online chess board\nThe Nimzowitch-Larsen Attack is named after Aron Nimzowitsch and Bent Larsen, who both commonly played 1.b3 or 1. Nf3 2. b3. It's an uncommon opening, especially at the beginner level, which makes it a good opening for newcomers to learn, as their opponent will likely be unprepared for it.\n\nThe Nimzowitsch-Larsen Attack lets players put their dark-square bishop on b2 early in the game, which helps to control the center and also gives White a dangerous weapon against Black's kingside, especially if they castle on that side. A common tactic for Black is to try and block White's dark-squared bishop with their pawn structure and to attack White's kingside, which can be underdeveloped in the mid-game if White isn't careful.\n\nThe two most popular continuations from this position are 1. e5 2. Bb2 Nc6 3. e3 Nf6 4. Bb5 Bd6 and 1. e5 2. Bb2 Nc6 3. e3 d5 4. Bb5 Bd6. In both examples, White is trying to capture Black's knight and then take their pawn, which would be undefended.\n\nExample Game To Study\nLarsen, Bent vs Eley, Brian (1972)\n\n1.b3 e5 2.Bb2 Nc6 3.e3 Nf6 4.Bb5 d6 5.Ne2 Bd7 6.0-0 Be7 7.f4 e4 8.Ng3 0-0 9.Bxc6 bxc6 10.c4 d5 11.Nc3 Re8 12.Rc1 Bg4 13.Nce2 Nd7 14.h3 Bxe2 15.Qxe2 Nc5 16.Qg4 g6 17.f5 Nd3 18.fxg6 hxg6 19.Rf7 Kf7 20.Rf1 Bf6 21.Bxf6 1-0\n\n5\nSicilian Defense\nsicilians defense chess opening on 2d board\nThe Sicilian Defense has become the most common response to e5, so it's certainly worth learning the move as both White and Black. However, the Sicilian Defense is a minefield when it comes to chess theory \u2013 entire books have been written about it. Therefore, the best strategy to adopt when encountering the opening as a beginner is to stick to basic opening principles -- control the center of the board, develop pieces, and castle early.\n\nThe idea behind c5 for Black is that it discourages White from playing d4, their ideal move. The most common move for White in this position is to play Nf3, with the idea of pushing d4 next move. If cxd4, White has the move Nxd4.\n\nExample Game To Study\nFischer, Robert James vs Saidy, Anthony (1957)\n\n1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 d6 6.Bc4 Bd7 7.Bb3 e6 8.O-O Be7 9.Be3 O-O 10.f4 Nxd4 11.Bxd4 Bc6 12.Qe2 b5 13.Nxb5 Bxe4 14.Nxa7 e5 15.fxe5 dxe5 16.Be3 Qb8 17.Nb5 Bc6 18.Nc3 Qb4 19.Rad1 Ra5 20.Rd2 Qh4 21.Bb6 Rc5 22.Rd3 Rb8 23.Bxc5 Bxc5+ 24.Kh1 h5 25.Qxe5 Ba7 26.Qg3 1-0\n\n6\nFrench Defense\nfrench defense chess opening on 2d board\nThe French Defense is the third most common response to e4, with e5 being the second. The idea is that Black wants to counter White by playing d5 next move, quickly challenging White for control of the center. It's a solid move for Black, as it usually leads to closed positions in the mid-game. This is handy when learning the game or playing against a higher-rated opponent.\n\nHowever, the increase in defense creates an offensive issue. The main one is that Black will likely struggle to develop their light-squared bishop due to Black's pawn structure blocking it in. The most common continuation from this position is 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3, defending the e4 pawn with the knight.\n\nExample Game To Study\nKosintseva, Tatiana vs Xu Yuhua (2006)\n\n1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 dxe4 5.Nxe4 Be7 6.Bxf6 Bxf6 7.Nf3 O-O 8.Qd2 Nd7 9.O-O-O b6 10.Bd3 Bb7 11.h4 Be7 12.Neg5 Nf6 13.c3 Bxf3 14.gxf3 c5 15.Qc2 h6 16.Nh7 Re8 17.Nxf6+ Bxf6 18.dxc5 Qe7 19.c6 Bxh4 20.Ba6 Bg5+ 21.Kb1 Rad8 22.Qe4 Rxd1+ 23.Rxd1 Rd8 24.Bd3 Qc7 25.Rg1 Kf8 26.Qb4+ Be7 27.Qe4 Bf6 28.Qb4+ Kg8 29.Be4 Be5 30.Qc4 Rd2 31.a4 Kf8 32.Re1 h5 33.Bc2 Bf6 34.Qb4+ Be7 35.Qe4 Bf6 36.Qb4+ Kg8 37.Qe4 g6 38.Qe3 Rd8 39.Be4 Kg7 40.Rg1 h4 41.f4 Be7 42.f5 exf5 43.Bxf5 Bc5 44.Qf3 Rd2 45.Rg2 Qe5 46.Ka2 Bd6 47.Bd7 Qc5 48.Kb1 Qc4 49.Be8 Qb3 0-1\n\n7\nCaro Kann Defence\nCaro Kann Defence on an online chess board\nThe Caro-Kann Defence is the fourth most popular response to 1. e4. The opening is similar to the French Defence (more on that later) in the sense that Black ideally wants to play 2. d5, quickly challenging White's e4 pawn for control of the center.\n\nOne of the main benefits of the Caro-Kann Defence in comparison to the French Defence is that Black's light-squared bishop doesn't tend to get blocked, though it does prevent Black from moving their knight to the c6 square.\n\nExample Game To Study\nMorozevich, Alexander vs Ivanchuk, Vassily (2004)\n\n1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 Bf5 4.f4 e6 5.Nf3 c5 6.Be3 cxd4 7.Nxd4 Ne7 8.Bb5+ Nd7 9.O-O a6 10.Be2 g5 11.g4 gxf4 12.gxf5 Nxf5 13.Nxf5 fxe3 14.Nc3 Rg8+ 15.Kh1 Qg5 16.Bf3 Nxe5 17.Qe2 Qxf5 18.Bxd5 Qh3 19.Bxb7 Ra7 20.Bf3 Bh6 21.Ne4 Ke7 22.Qe1 f5 23.Qb4+ Kf7 24.Qd4 Nxf3 25.Qf6+ Ke8 26.Qxe6+ Kf8 27.Qf6+ Rf7 28.Qd6+ Kg7 29.Rg1+ Kh8 30.Nf6 0-1\n\n8\nScholar's Mate\nscholars mate chess opening on 2d board\nThe Scholar's Mate isn't a great opening to learn when aiming for chess improvement, but it's handy to know to avoid being beaten by it. White has checkmated Black in this position, as the king can't escape White's queen. Meanwhile, White's bishop prevents Black from capturing it.\n\nRELATED:\nFamous Chess Games Every Beginner Should Study\n\nThankfully, there are a few ways to combat this as Black. For starters, Black can play Nf6 on move 3, guarding the f7 square and simultaneously developing a minor piece. It also prevents White from moving their queen to h5, which is another way to deliver the early checkmate. Opening in this way isn't a good strategy for White, as it usually puts them in a poor position in the middle game due to their awkwardly placed queen.\n\nExample Game To Study\nFontes, Carlos vs Pina, Vladimiro (2001)\n\n1.e4 e5 2.Bc4 Nf6 3.Qf3 Bc5 4.a3 d6 5.b4 Bb6 6.Nc3 c6 7.Nge2 O-O 8.h3 Be6 9.d3 d5 10.Bb3 d4 11.Na4 Bc7 12.Nc5 Bxb3 13.Nxb3 Ne8 14.Ng3 g6 15.Bh6 Ng7 16.h4 a5 17.h5 axb4 18.Qg4 Qf6 19.Bg5 Qe6 20.Qh4 f6 21.hxg6 hxg6 22.Qh7+ Kf7 23.Nc5 Qe7 24.Rh6 Ke8 25.Qxg6+ Qf7 26.Qxf6 Rxa3 27.Rb1 Na6 28.Qxf7+ Kxf7 29.Nd7 Rg8 30.Nf6 Bd8 31.Nxg8 Bxg5 32.Rh8 Ra2 33.Nh6+ Kg6 34.Nhf5 Ne6 35.Nh4+ Kg7 36.Re8 Kf7 37.Rh8 Rxc2 38.Nf3 Bf6 39.Rh7+ Kg6 40.Rxb7 Nac5 41.R7xb4 Nxd3+ 42.Kd1 Nxb4 43.Rxb4 Rxf2 44.Rb6 Rxg2 45.Rxc6 Nd8 46.Nxe5+ Kg5 47.Nf3+ Kg4 48.Rxf6 Rxg3 49.Nxd4 Rd3+ 50.Ke2 Rxd4 51.Ke3 Ra4 52.Rf8 Ra3+ 53.Kf2 Ne6 54.Rf6 Nf4 55.e5 Ra5 56.e6 Re5 57.Kf1 Nxe6 58.Rf7 Nf4 59.Rf8 Kf3 0-1\n\n9\nQueen's Gambit\nqueens gambit chess opening on 2d board\nThe Queen's Gambit is an opening that new players may want to learn after watching the show of the same name. The move may seem odd to new players, as Black is free to take the unprotected c4 pawn. However, White is likely to win a pawn back. The most common way for White to win the pawn back is with the move e3, which opens up the bishop to capture Black's pawn. Black can continue trying to defend the pawn, though they will likely find themselves in an awkward position.\n\nIf Black doesn't take the pawn, then White enjoys decent control of the center and is free to start developing their pieces and get castled.\n\nExample Game To Study\nKasparov, Garry vs Karpov, Anatoly (1986)\n\n1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Be7 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Bf4 Nf6 6.e3 O-O 7.Bd3 c5 8.Nf3 Nc6 9.O-O Bg4 10.dxc5 Bxc5 11.h3 Bxf3 12.Qxf3 d4 13.Ne4 Be7 14.Rad1 Qa5 15.Ng3 dxe3 16.fxe3 Qxa2 17.Nf5 Qe6 18.Bh6 Ne8 19.Qh5 g6 20.Qg4 Ne5 21.Qg3 Bf6 22.Bb5 Ng7 23.Bxg7 Bxg7 24.Rd6 Qb3 25.Nxg7 Qxb5 26.Nf5 Rad8 27.Rf6 Rd2 28.Qg5 Qxb2 29.Kh1 Kh8 30.Nd4 Rxd4 31.Qxe5 1-0\n\n10\nKing's Indian Defense\nkings indian defense chess opening on 2d board\nThe King's Indian Defense is a common response to White's d4 and c4 moves. Black intends to play g7 within their next few moves, allowing them to castle and develop some center control with their pieces rather than pawns. Generally speaking, this opening allows both players to comfortably start developing their minor pieces. It also allows them to castle within the first ten moves without any real trouble.\n\nA common continuation from this position is 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5. The move e5 challenges the center while White is ready to castle.\n\nExample Game To Study\nRobert Byrne vs Robert James Fischer (1963)\n\n1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.g3 c6 4.Bg2 d5 5.cxd5 cxd5 6.Nc3 Bg7 7.e3 O-O 8.Nge2 Nc6 9.O-O b6 10.b3 Ba6 11.Ba3 Re8 12.Qd2 e5 13.dxe5 Nxe5 14.Rfd1 Nd3 15.Qc2 Nxf2 16.Kxf2 Ng4+ 17.Kg1 Nxe3 18.Qd2 Nxg2 19.Kxg2 d4 20.Nxd4 Bb7+ 21.Kf1 Qd7 0-1\n\n11\nLondon System\nlondon system chess opening on 2d board\nThe London System is very common for new players to learn as it usually allows White to safely develop their pieces and obtain a solid position moving into the mid-game. A common strategy for White in this position is to play e3 on their next turn; this defends White's dark-squared bishop while also allowing the light-squared to develop, letting White castle kingside.\n\nA common continuation from here is 3. c5 4. e3 Nc6 5. c3 e6 6. Nbd2 Bd6, giving both players a solid position to begin the mid-game.\n\nExample Game To Study\nCarlsen, Magnus vs Caruana, Fabiano (2017)\n\n1.d4 d5 2.Bf4 Nf6 3.e3 e6 4.Nf3 c5 5.c3 Nc6 6.Nbd2 Bd6 7.Bg3 O-O 8.Bb5 Bxg3 9.hxg3 Qb6 10.a4 h6 11.O-O Ne7 12.Qb3 Qc7 13.a5 Bd7 14.Be2 Ng6 15.Qa3 c4 16.b3 cxb3 17.Nxb3 Ne4 18.Rfc1 Bc6 19.c4 dxc4 20.Rxc4 Qd8 21.Nc5 Nd6 22.Rc2 Bd5 23.Bd3 b6 24.e4 bxc5 25.exd5 exd5 26.dxc5 Ne4 27.c6 Qc7 28.Qb3 Rfd8 29.Qb7 Rac8 30.Rb1 Qxa5 31.c7 Rf8 32.Qb5 Qa3 33.Qxd5 Nc3 34.Rxc3 Qxc3 35.Bxg6 Rxc7 36.Ne5 Qc5 37.Bxf7+ Rfxf7 38.Rb8+ 1-0\n\n12\nKing's Indian Attack\nkings indian attack chess opening on 2d board\nThe King's Indian Attack is a great opening for beginners as it's easy to learn, quickly gets White's king safe, and isn't a theoretical minefield like many of the e4 openings.\n\nThe King's Indian Attack is similar to the aforementioned King's Indian Defense, but with White having an extra tempo. The opening has similar benefits to the King's Indian Defense, as White aims to control the center while developing pieces and can castle within their first few moves after moving their light-squared bishop to g2.\n\nAfter fianchettoing the bishop and casting, it's often a good idea to play d3. The purpose of d3 is that it stops Black from playing e4, opens a line for the dark-squared bishop, and also gives the b1 knight the option to go to the d2 square.\n\nExample Game To Study\nVaganian, Rafael A vs Sveshnikov, Evgeny (1980)\n\n1.Nf3 d5 2.g3 Nf6 3.Bg2 c6 4.O-O Bf5 5.d3 e6 6.Nbd2 Be7 7.Qe1 h6 8.e4 Bh7 9.Ne5 Nbd7 10.Nxd7 Nxd7 11.f4 O-O 12.Kh1 a5 13.g4 a4 14.f5 a3 15.b3 Re8 16.Rb1 exf5 17.gxf5 Qa5 18.exd5 cxd5 19.Qg3 Bb4 20.Nf3 Kh8 21.f6 Nxf6 22.Bxh6 Nh5 23.Qg4 Ra6 24.Ng5 Bg6 25.Nxf7+ Bxf7 26.Bxg7+ Nxg7 27.Rxf7 Bf8 28.Rbf1 Qc5 29.b4 Qd6 30.Rxg7 Bxg7 31.Qh5+ Qh6 32.Qxe8+ Kh7 33.Bxd5 Qh3 34.Be4+ Kh6 35.Rg1 1-0\n\nMORE:\nEndgame Tips In Chess That Every Beginner Should Know\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nLink copied to clipboard\nRelated Topics\nLISTS\nTABLETOP\nAbout The Author\nJack Pursey\n(494 Articles Published)\nJack began working at Game Rant as a List writer and has worked his way up to the position of Evergreen Editor.
