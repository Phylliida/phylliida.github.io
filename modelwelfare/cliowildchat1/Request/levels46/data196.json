The FastDigest HindIII (thermo\nscientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp)\nutilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically\ncompetent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product\nwill be plated on Ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto\nstreptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property.\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior\nto ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however,\nthroughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be\nthoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the\nmistakes.\nMethods/Materials\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid\npUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET\ngenomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)\nrespectively.\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\nGenomic material A260/A280 A260/A230 DNA Conc.

The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 \u00b5L for both DNA. Elution\nbuffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on\nSimpliNano.\nPart B write up 2\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion\nbut BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI\nwill show same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E.coli as it was the case with K12\nstrain.\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with thermos\nscientific FastDigest BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the\nreagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\nDigestion Reagents pUC19 Top10 (rspL gene)\nGenetic material 2 \u00b5L 10 \u00b5L\nFast digest buffer 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme) 1 \u00b5L 1 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade Water 30 \u00b5L 22 \u00b5L\nTotal Reaction volume 35 \u00b5L 35 \u00b5L\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic\nmaterials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were\nincubated in 37 \u00b0C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 \u00b0C for 10 minutes.\nGel electrophoresis to verify digestion from band sizes:\nThis gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion\nwas successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To\nprepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg BIOTECHNOLOGY GRADE Agarose ITM powder\n(Lot : 19H2056197) in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM (0008-090501.52) for\nvisualization.\n1Kb DNA ladder RTU (Froggo-BIO, BIO-HELIX LOT 14007210104) was used as a standard with\nThermo Scientific 6X loading dye (LOT 00799325). 10 \u00b5L of digested genomic was loaded into\nthe gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light(Midi Blue LED\nTransilluminator), there were no bands visible.\nDNA clean-up:\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab\ninstructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using \u201cThermo Scientific GeneJET Gel\nExtraction and DNA clean up kit\u201d the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was\nintroduced in original clean up protocol which stated \u201c10 \u00b5L of Elution buffer\u201d to elute which\nPart B write up 3\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nwas updated to \u201c15 \u00b5L of Elution Buffer\u201d. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on\nSimpliNano after clean up which indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\nCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\nA260/A230 0.826\nA260/A280 1.609\nng/ \u00b5L 12\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after\nclean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306).\nVolume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 \u00b5L and the blank used was the elution\nbuffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided\nby lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which\nwas then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15 \u00b5L elution\nbuffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table\nbelow.\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\nBefore clean up After clean up\nA260/A280 1.598 1.794\nA260/A230 1.143 2.188\nng/ \u00b5L 28.1 109.6\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA\nprovided by Vanessa.

Volume of\nsample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 \u00b5L and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT\n01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\nNew Digestion reaction set up with cleaned up genomic DNA:\nThe new digestion was performed using the cleaned up genomic DNA with higher\nconcentration. The table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\nTable 5: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material.\npUC19 Top10 genomic DNA\nConcentration 17.2 ng/ \u00b5L 109.6 ng/ \u00b5L\nGenomic material 4 \u00b5L 5 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Buffer 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nPart B write up 4\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI) 1 \u00b5L 1 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade water 28 \u00b5L 27 \u00b5L\nTotal reaction volume 35 \u00b5L 35 \u00b5L\nThe table gives the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both\ngenetic materials used in this project to construct a genomic library. Both reactions were\nincubated for half an hour in 37 \u00b0C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 \u00b0C for 10 minutes.\nThe digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was\nready.\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared using same supplies however since the\nconcentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 \u00b5L of cut and uncut\ngenomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded.\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut\ngenomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by\nMahan\u2019s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first\nvisualized under UV light (Midi Blue LED Transilluminator) and then under BIOrad software\nwhich will be added in result section.\nLigation with only one reaction:\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the\nfollowing week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic\ntop10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000.\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\nReaction reagents Ligation ratio (1:1)\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA) 3 \u00b5L\nVector (digested pUC19) 3 \u00b5L\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X) 5 \u00b5L\nT4 Ligase 2 \u00b5L\nPEG4000 2 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade water 10 \u00b5L\nTotal reaction volume 25 \u00b5L\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction\nenzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was\nincubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 \u00b0C for 10 minutes. The\nligated product was then stored at -20 \u00b0C until transformation.\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\nPart B write up 5\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To\nproceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 \u00b5L each) were provided by Vanessa\nalong with 4 agar plates.\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one\nexperimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent\ncells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\nTable 7: Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\nReaction Positive control Negative control Experimental\nReagents 50 \u00b5L competent\ncells + 10 \u00b5L pUC19\n50 \u00b5L of competent\ncells\n50\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at\n42 \u00b0C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered.\nMeanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread\nwith 100 \u00b5L of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 \u00b5L of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 \u00b5L of 500 mM IPTG per\nplate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was\nintroduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 \u00b5L\nonto plates, 150 \u00b5L was plated for each to increase the concentration.\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 \u00b0 C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from\nincubator the next day (March 25, 2023).\nThe results of transformation depicted signs of contamination and no white colonies were\npresent. On the assumption that contamination might have masked the ligation results.\nNew transformation using same ligated product:\nThe following week (March 28, 2023), the same ligated product was used for transformation\nusing same supplies as in previous section. No ligation control was set up as there was not\nenough ligated product left. Following exact same procedure the transformation was\ncompleted and plates were incubated at 35 \u0366 C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from\nincubator the next day (March 29, 2023).\nThe results suggested no success since no white colony was visible.\nDigesting with BamHI and HindIII :\nIn the final week (April 4, 2023) of this project, a new digestion reaction was set up using two\nrestriction enzymes that is FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) and FastDigest BamHI (thermo\nscientific).\nThe reaction reagents and volumes used are listed in the table given below\nPart B write up 6\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nTable 9: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material using\ntwo enzymes.\npUC19 Top10 genomic DNA\nConcentration 17.2 ng/ \u00b5L 109.6 ng/ \u00b5L\nGenomic material 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Buffer 1 \u00b5L 1 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI) 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Enzyme (HindIII) 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade water 3 \u00b5L 3 \u00b5L\nTotal reaction volume 10 \u00b5L 10 \u00b5L\nThe table enlists the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both\ngenetic materials with thermos scientific FastDigest BamHI and HindIII. Both digestion reactions\nwere incubated for half an hour in 37 \u00b0C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 \u00b0C for 10\nminutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis\napparatus was ready.\nGel electrophoresis to verify digestion of genomic material using 2 restriction enzymes:\nWhile performing the digestion reactions one team member was setting up the 1% agarose gel\npreparation. To do so, 500 mg BIOTECHNOLOGY GRADE Agarose ITM powder (Lot : 19H2056197)\nwas used in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer. 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM (0008-090501.52) was added to the\nmixture once cool enough.\n1Kb DNA ladder RTU (Froggo-BIO, BIO-HELIX LOT 14007210104) was used as standard.\nAbout 10 \u00b5L of the sample with 2 \u00b5L loading dye was used to load digested genomic top10 ,\ndigested genomic , undigested pUC19 plasmid , digested plasmid were loaded along with the\nstandard using Thermo Scientific 6X loading dye (LOT 00799325). Once the set up was ready\nand the 30 minutes incubation was complete, the 1% gel electrophoresis was performed was 20\nminutes at 120V. On completion the gel was visualized under UV light (Midi Blue LED\nTransilluminator).\nThe gel results were not up to mark but since there was no time to carry out any other\nprocedures this project came to an end.\nResults\nPart B write up 7\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene\nafter digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE\nbuffer with 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for\n1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 \u00b5L loaded as standard whilst the well\nlabelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 \u00b5L digested sample + 2 \u00b5L loading dye). The\nabove gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded\nwhich was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low\nconcentration of genomic DNA.\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM requires at minimum 50 ng/ \u00b5L of the sample\nconcentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was\nunsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was\nalready quite low with 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume\nof 35 \u00b5L we used 10 \u00b5L of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not\nonly this when we loaded 10 \u00b5L digested sample with 2 \u00b5L loading dye it further diluted. As per\nthis, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L which is very less than 50 ng/ \u00b5L as\nper the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\n(33.2 ng / \u00b5L \u00d7 10 \u00b5L in digestion) / (10 \u00b5L while loading) = 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L\n\nPart B write up 8\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nHence, nothing was detected.Furthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10\nwas not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes\nat 120 V under UV light.

These sites give very\nbig fragments that can be seen as smear in image 2.\nThis enzyme cuts at 662 on pUC19 and creates sticky ends. The total size of the plasmid is 2686\nbp. If we incorporate this plasmid inside a host mentioned above, it gives a smear.

The cutting\npositions for BamHI are 180 and 2865 and for HindIII is 4130. We used HindIII to make sure that\nour fragment contains rspL gene.\nImage 9: Information regarding the total length of the plasmid DNA using restriction analyzer\nPart B write up 14\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nThe above image provides information related to the pUC19 plasmid DNA that is 2686 bp long.\nThe tool used for this was restriction analyzer. It also shows that BamHI cuts at 662 position on\nplasmid DNA and HindIII cuts at 632 positions. Since we are using two different enzymes, there\nis a better chance that our fragment contains rspL gene.\nDiscussion\nThe primary objective of this project was to create a genomic library using a streptomycinresistant strain of E.coli Top10 (4537 bp) as the genomic DNA, incorporating it into a pUC19\nplasmid (2686 bp) vector (Cirino et al., 2003). The successful construction of this genomic\nlibrary was expected to confer streptomycin resistance to a recipient E.coli strain Mach1\nthrough the functional selection of the rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983). However, throughout the\nexperiment, several challenges were encountered, leading to changes in the experimental\ndesign and troubleshooting of errors.\nAn initial gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of the rspL gene after digestion\nof genomic DNA with BamHI resulted in no visible bands. This was primarily due to the low\nconcentration of the originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA (33.2 ng/\u00b5L), which was further\ndiluted during the digestion reaction and loading of the gel (Inoue et al., 1990). This\nconcentration was below the minimum detection limit required for the INtRON RedSafeTM\nnucleic acid stain to work efficiently (50 ng/\u00b5L). As a consequence, no bands were detected,\nand the experiment had to be repeated with a new and cleaned up genomic DNA sample.\nSubsequent gel electrophoresis performed after digesting the cleaned-up genomic DNA with\nBamHI showed successful digestion of the genomic Top10 DNA, as evidenced by a shorter\nsmear in comparison to the uncut band of the genomic DNA (Sorek et al., 2013). In addition, the\nplasmid pUC19 showed two very faint bands after digestion with BamHI, indicating appropriate\ndigestion of the plasmid as well.\nPart B write up 15\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nA ligation reaction was set up using a 1:1 ratio for cut genomic Top10 DNA (insert) and cut\nplasmid pUC19 (vector) (Chen & Dubnau, 2004). After overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C, the ligated\nproduct was transformed into Mach1 chemically competent cells. The initial transformation\nresults were inconclusive due to contamination observed in the positive control plate.\nMoreover, the second transformation attempt resulted in an unsuccessful transformation due\nto inefficient uptake of DNA by the host organism, which might have been caused by several\nfactors, such as improper preparation of competent cells, issues concerning the ligation\nreaction, or the transformation protocol itself (Inoue et al., 1990).\nTo increase the likelihood of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene, a third gel\nelectrophoresis was performed using HindIII in addition to BamHI for digesting both genomic\nTop10 DNA and plasmid pUC19 (Cirino et al., 2003). The use of two different enzymes would\nincrease the accuracy of the construct and facilitate the incorporation of the desired fragment\ninto the plasmid (Hanahan, 1983).\nBased on the information provided by the restriction analyzer, the BamHI enzyme cuts at two\ndifferent sites on genomic DNA (180 and 2865), producing large fragments that appeared as a\nsmear in the gel electrophoresis images (Sorek et al., 2013). HindIII was introduced to cut at an\nadditional site (4130) on genomic DNA, increasing the likelihood that the fragment containing\nthe rspL gene would be successfully incorporated into the plasmid (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nIn summary, the construction of a genomic library using E.coli Top10 genomic DNA and pUC19\nplasmid DNA encountered several challenges throughout the experiment, including low DNA\nconcentrations, contamination, and inefficient transformation (Inoue et al., 1990). The\nintroduction of the HindIII enzyme in addition to BamHI for restriction digestion was expected\nto increase the probability of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene (Cirino et al., 2003).\nFurthermore, troubleshooting in each area of competent cells preparation, ligation reaction,\nand transformation protocol can assist in identifying and rectifying these challenges, such as reevaluating the insert-to-vector ratio, incubation time, and temperature for the ligation reaction\nor testing and optimizing various transformation conditions (Hanahan, 1983).\nFor this experiment, the most likely problem would be with transformation. It could be\noptimized and modified by making changes mentioned below:\na. Temperature and duration: Confirm that the heat shock conditions (e.g. 42\u00b0C for 30-45\nseconds) are appropriate for your cells (Inoue et al., 1990).\nb. Recovery duration: Allow adequate time (usually 1 hour) for the cells to recover and express\nthe antibiotic resistance marker (Sorek et al., 2013).\nc. Optimal antibiotic concentration: Ensure the appropriate concentration of streptomycin for\nselection is used on the plates. Too high or low of a concentration may result in inadequate\nselection (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nPart B write up 16\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nIn addition to the technical challenges faced during the genomic library construction, human\nerrors could also have contributed to the unsuccessful or inconclusive results. These errors can\noccur in sample handling, reagent preparation, equipment usage, and protocol execution. Such\nerrors may include:\n1. Cross-contamination: During handling of samples, there is potential for cross-contamination\nbetween different DNA samples or between the samples and reagents, leading to undesired\nresults (Inoue et al., 1990).\n2. Reagent preparation: Errors can occur while preparing various reagents such as buffers,\nenzyme solutions, or antibiotics. These could include inaccurate measurement or mixing of\ncomponents, resulting in incorrect concentrations that can affect experimental outcomes\n(Sorek et al., 2013).\n3. Pipetting errors: Inaccurate pipetting can lead to incorrect volumes being dispensed, resulting\nin the incorrect sample or reagent concentration, which affects the outcome of experiments\n(Hanahan, 1983).\n4. Equipment usage: Improper operation, maintenance, or calibration of laboratory equipment\ncan generate unreliable or inconsistent results. For instance, inaccurate temperature settings\nfor incubation or heat shock can affect the transformation efficiency (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nTo minimize human errors, it is essential to maintain good laboratory practices, maintaining\nproper organization of the workspace, labeling samples accurately, and double-checking\nreagent concentrations. Additionally, regularly calibrating and maintaining equipment,\nfollowing established protocols carefully, and incorporating appropriate controls into\nexperiments will help reduce the occurrence of human errors and enhance the overall success\nof the genomic library construction process.\nFuture experiments can investigate alternative restriction enzymes, plasmid vectors, and\ncompetent cell strains to improve the overall success of the genomic library construction\nprocess (Cirino et al., 2003). Moreover, ensuring a suitable recovery time for transformed cells,\nproviding a nutrient-rich medium during recovery, using appropriate plating methods and\nconditions, and including positive and negative controls in each transformation experiment will\naid in enhancing the efficiency of the genomic library construction and subsequent functional\nselection of the streptomycin resistance-conferring rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983).\nConclusion\nPart B write up 17\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nIn conclusion, the construction of a genomic library using E.coli Top10 genomic DNA and pUC19\nplasmid DNA proved to be challenging due to several factors, including low DNA\nconcentrations, contamination, and inefficient transformation. Optimization of the\ntransformation process, selection of alternative restriction enzymes, plasmid vectors, and\ncompetent cell strains could enhance the overall success of the genomic library construction\nand subsequent functional selection of the streptomycin resistance-conferring rspL gene.\nFuture experiments should also emphasize proper controls, recovery conditions, and nutrientrich media to improve the efficiency of this process. \n\nuse the above mentioned information and make me a ppt using the format mentioned below:\n\nDeliverable Marks\nPower Point format of summarized data\n\u2022 Brief background/purpose (3)\n\u2022 Brief experimental set-up with corresponding results (10)\no Clear tables figures and legends\n13\nTroubleshooting and Next Steps\n\u2022 Discussion of results (10)\no Possible reasons of error, possible optimization\n\u2022 Discuss next steps to proceed forward in the experiment (3)\n13\nSupporting References and Citations\n\u2022 Should have at least (3) 3\nPresentation\n\u2022 Shared presentation (3)\n\u2022 Total presentation 10-15min maximum (2)\n5\nIndividual Grade\n\u2022 Speaks clearly and confidently (2)\n\u2022 Knowledgeable (2)\n\u2022 Successfully answer questions asked (2)\n6\nTotal Deliverable Grade 40\nLab Partner Rubric Grade 10\nTotal Presentation Grade 50"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Slide 1: Title Slide\n- Genomic Library Construction using E.coli Top10 and pUC19\n\nSlide 2: Background/Purpose\n- Create a genomic library with E.coli Top10 (streptomycin-resistant strain) as the genomic DNA\n- Incorporate it into pUC19 plasmid vector\n- Confirm the presence of rspL gene (streptomycin resistance)\n\nSlide 3: Experimental Set-up\n- Isolate genomic DNA and plasmid DNA\n- Perform Restriction Enzyme Digestion (BamHI, HindIII)\n- Gel electrophoresis to verify digestion\n- Ligate digested fragments to pUC19 plasmid\n- Transform ligated product into Mach1 competent cells\n\nSlide 4: Results (Gel Electrophoresis)\n- Image 1: First gel electrophoresis - No visible bands\n- Image 2: Second gel electrophoresis - Successful digestion of genomic DNA and plasmid\n- Image 3: BIORAD image - Confirmation of digestion\n\nSlide 5: Results (Ligation and Transformation)\n- Image 4: Transformation plates - First attempt, contamination in positive control\n- Image 5: Transformation plates - Second attempt, unsuccessful transformation\n\nSlide 6: Troubleshooting and Discussion\n- Low DNA concentrations\n- Contamination\n- Inefficient transformation\n\nSlide 7: Next Steps\n- Optimize transformation conditions\n- Investigate alternative restriction enzymes, plasmid vectors, and competent cell strains\n- Ensure suitable recovery time and conditions\n\nSlide 8: Supporting References\n[1] Cirino, P.

The FastDigest HindIII (thermo\nscientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp)\nutilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically\ncompetent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product\nwill be plated on Ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto\nstreptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property.\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior\nto ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however,\nthroughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be\nthoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the\nmistakes.\nMethods/Materials\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid\npUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET\ngenomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)\nrespectively.\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\nGenomic material A260/A280 A260/A230 DNA Conc. (ng/\u00b5L)\nTop10 1.988 1.644 33.2\npUC19 1.866 1.211 17.2\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentration data for isolated genomic material on\nFeb 21, 2023. The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 \u00b5L for both DNA. Elution\nbuffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on\nSimpliNano.\nPart B write up 2\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion\nbut BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI\nwill show same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E.coli as it was the case with K12\nstrain.\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with thermos\nscientific FastDigest BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the\nreagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\nDigestion Reagents pUC19 Top10 (rspL gene)\nGenetic material 2 \u00b5L 10 \u00b5L\nFast digest buffer 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme) 1 \u00b5L 1 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade Water 30 \u00b5L 22 \u00b5L\nTotal Reaction volume 35 \u00b5L 35 \u00b5L\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic\nmaterials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were\nincubated in 37 \u00b0C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 \u00b0C for 10 minutes.\nGel electrophoresis to verify digestion from band sizes:\nThis gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion\nwas successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To\nprepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg BIOTECHNOLOGY GRADE Agarose ITM powder\n(Lot : 19H2056197) in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM (0008-090501.52) for\nvisualization.\n1Kb DNA ladder RTU (Froggo-BIO, BIO-HELIX LOT 14007210104) was used as a standard with\nThermo Scientific 6X loading dye (LOT 00799325). 10 \u00b5L of digested genomic was loaded into\nthe gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light(Midi Blue LED\nTransilluminator), there were no bands visible.\nDNA clean-up:\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab\ninstructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using \u201cThermo Scientific GeneJET Gel\nExtraction and DNA clean up kit\u201d the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was\nintroduced in original clean up protocol which stated \u201c10 \u00b5L of Elution buffer\u201d to elute which\nPart B write up 3\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nwas updated to \u201c15 \u00b5L of Elution Buffer\u201d. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on\nSimpliNano after clean up which indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\nCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\nA260/A230 0.826\nA260/A280 1.609\nng/ \u00b5L 12\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after\nclean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306).\nVolume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 \u00b5L and the blank used was the elution\nbuffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided\nby lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which\nwas then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15 \u00b5L elution\nbuffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table\nbelow.\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\nBefore clean up After clean up\nA260/A280 1.598 1.794\nA260/A230 1.143 2.188\nng/ \u00b5L 28.1 109.6\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA\nprovided by Vanessa. These concentrations refer to the DNA before using GeneJET genomic\nDNA purification kit with its corresponding elution buffer as blank. Also after clean up using\nThermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of\nsample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 \u00b5L and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT\n01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\nNew Digestion reaction set up with cleaned up genomic DNA:\nThe new digestion was performed using the cleaned up genomic DNA with higher\nconcentration. The table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\nTable 5: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material.\npUC19 Top10 genomic DNA\nConcentration 17.2 ng/ \u00b5L 109.6 ng/ \u00b5L\nGenomic material 4 \u00b5L 5 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Buffer 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nPart B write up 4\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI) 1 \u00b5L 1 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade water 28 \u00b5L 27 \u00b5L\nTotal reaction volume 35 \u00b5L 35 \u00b5L\nThe table gives the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both\ngenetic materials used in this project to construct a genomic library. Both reactions were\nincubated for half an hour in 37 \u00b0C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 \u00b0C for 10 minutes.\nThe digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was\nready.\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared using same supplies however since the\nconcentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 \u00b5L of cut and uncut\ngenomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded.\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut\ngenomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by\nMahan\u2019s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first\nvisualized under UV light (Midi Blue LED Transilluminator) and then under BIOrad software\nwhich will be added in result section.\nLigation with only one reaction:\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the\nfollowing week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic\ntop10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000.\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\nReaction reagents Ligation ratio (1:1)\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA) 3 \u00b5L\nVector (digested pUC19) 3 \u00b5L\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X) 5 \u00b5L\nT4 Ligase 2 \u00b5L\nPEG4000 2 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade water 10 \u00b5L\nTotal reaction volume 25 \u00b5L\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction\nenzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was\nincubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 \u00b0C for 10 minutes. The\nligated product was then stored at -20 \u00b0C until transformation.\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\nPart B write up 5\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To\nproceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 \u00b5L each) were provided by Vanessa\nalong with 4 agar plates.\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one\nexperimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent\ncells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\nTable 7: Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\nReaction Positive control Negative control Experimental\nReagents 50 \u00b5L competent\ncells + 10 \u00b5L pUC19\n50 \u00b5L of competent\ncells\n50\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at\n42 \u00b0C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered.\nMeanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread\nwith 100 \u00b5L of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 \u00b5L of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 \u00b5L of 500 mM IPTG per\nplate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was\nintroduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 \u00b5L\nonto plates, 150 \u00b5L was plated for each to increase the concentration.\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 \u00b0 C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from\nincubator the next day (March 25, 2023).\nThe results of transformation depicted signs of contamination and no white colonies were\npresent. On the assumption that contamination might have masked the ligation results.\nNew transformation using same ligated product:\nThe following week (March 28, 2023), the same ligated product was used for transformation\nusing same supplies as in previous section. No ligation control was set up as there was not\nenough ligated product left. Following exact same procedure the transformation was\ncompleted and plates were incubated at 35 \u0366 C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from\nincubator the next day (March 29, 2023).\nThe results suggested no success since no white colony was visible.\nDigesting with BamHI and HindIII :\nIn the final week (April 4, 2023) of this project, a new digestion reaction was set up using two\nrestriction enzymes that is FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) and FastDigest BamHI (thermo\nscientific).\nThe reaction reagents and volumes used are listed in the table given below\nPart B write up 6\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nTable 9: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material using\ntwo enzymes.\npUC19 Top10 genomic DNA\nConcentration 17.2 ng/ \u00b5L 109.6 ng/ \u00b5L\nGenomic material 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Buffer 1 \u00b5L 1 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI) 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Enzyme (HindIII) 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade water 3 \u00b5L 3 \u00b5L\nTotal reaction volume 10 \u00b5L 10 \u00b5L\nThe table enlists the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both\ngenetic materials with thermos scientific FastDigest BamHI and HindIII. Both digestion reactions\nwere incubated for half an hour in 37 \u00b0C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 \u00b0C for 10\nminutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis\napparatus was ready.\nGel electrophoresis to verify digestion of genomic material using 2 restriction enzymes:\nWhile performing the digestion reactions one team member was setting up the 1% agarose gel\npreparation. To do so, 500 mg BIOTECHNOLOGY GRADE Agarose ITM powder (Lot : 19H2056197)\nwas used in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer. 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM (0008-090501.52) was added to the\nmixture once cool enough.\n1Kb DNA ladder RTU (Froggo-BIO, BIO-HELIX LOT 14007210104) was used as standard.\nAbout 10 \u00b5L of the sample with 2 \u00b5L loading dye was used to load digested genomic top10 ,\ndigested genomic , undigested pUC19 plasmid , digested plasmid were loaded along with the\nstandard using Thermo Scientific 6X loading dye (LOT 00799325). Once the set up was ready\nand the 30 minutes incubation was complete, the 1% gel electrophoresis was performed was 20\nminutes at 120V. On completion the gel was visualized under UV light (Midi Blue LED\nTransilluminator).\nThe gel results were not up to mark but since there was no time to carry out any other\nprocedures this project came to an end.\nResults\nPart B write up 7\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene\nafter digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE\nbuffer with 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for\n1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 \u00b5L loaded as standard whilst the well\nlabelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 \u00b5L digested sample + 2 \u00b5L loading dye). The\nabove gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded\nwhich was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low\nconcentration of genomic DNA.\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM requires at minimum 50 ng/ \u00b5L of the sample\nconcentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was\nunsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was\nalready quite low with 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume\nof 35 \u00b5L we used 10 \u00b5L of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not\nonly this when we loaded 10 \u00b5L digested sample with 2 \u00b5L loading dye it further diluted. As per\nthis, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L which is very less than 50 ng/ \u00b5L as\nper the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\n(33.2 ng / \u00b5L \u00d7 10 \u00b5L in digestion) / (10 \u00b5L while loading) = 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L\n\nPart B write up 8\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nHence, nothing was detected.Furthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10\nwas not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes\nat 120 V under UV light.

The cutting\npositions for BamHI are 180 and 2865 and for HindIII is 4130. We used HindIII to make sure that\nour fragment contains rspL gene.\nImage 9: Information regarding the total length of the plasmid DNA using restriction analyzer\nPart B write up 14\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nThe above image provides information related to the pUC19 plasmid DNA that is 2686 bp long.\nThe tool used for this was restriction analyzer. It also shows that BamHI cuts at 662 position on\nplasmid DNA and HindIII cuts at 632 positions. Since we are using two different enzymes, there\nis a better chance that our fragment contains rspL gene.\nDiscussion\nThe primary objective of this project was to create a genomic library using a streptomycinresistant strain of E.coli Top10 (4537 bp) as the genomic DNA, incorporating it into a pUC19\nplasmid (2686 bp) vector (Cirino et al., 2003). The successful construction of this genomic\nlibrary was expected to confer streptomycin resistance to a recipient E.coli strain Mach1\nthrough the functional selection of the rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983). However, throughout the\nexperiment, several challenges were encountered, leading to changes in the experimental\ndesign and troubleshooting of errors.\nAn initial gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of the rspL gene after digestion\nof genomic DNA with BamHI resulted in no visible bands. This was primarily due to the low\nconcentration of the originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA (33.2 ng/\u00b5L), which was further\ndiluted during the digestion reaction and loading of the gel (Inoue et al., 1990). This\nconcentration was below the minimum detection limit required for the INtRON RedSafeTM\nnucleic acid stain to work efficiently (50 ng/\u00b5L). As a consequence, no bands were detected,\nand the experiment had to be repeated with a new and cleaned up genomic DNA sample.\nSubsequent gel electrophoresis performed after digesting the cleaned-up genomic DNA with\nBamHI showed successful digestion of the genomic Top10 DNA, as evidenced by a shorter\nsmear in comparison to the uncut band of the genomic DNA (Sorek et al., 2013). In addition, the\nplasmid pUC19 showed two very faint bands after digestion with BamHI, indicating appropriate\ndigestion of the plasmid as well.\nPart B write up 15\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nA ligation reaction was set up using a 1:1 ratio for cut genomic Top10 DNA (insert) and cut\nplasmid pUC19 (vector) (Chen & Dubnau, 2004). After overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C, the ligated\nproduct was transformed into Mach1 chemically competent cells. The initial transformation\nresults were inconclusive due to contamination observed in the positive control plate.\nMoreover, the second transformation attempt resulted in an unsuccessful transformation due\nto inefficient uptake of DNA by the host organism, which might have been caused by several\nfactors, such as improper preparation of competent cells, issues concerning the ligation\nreaction, or the transformation protocol itself (Inoue et al., 1990).\nTo increase the likelihood of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene, a third gel\nelectrophoresis was performed using HindIII in addition to BamHI for digesting both genomic\nTop10 DNA and plasmid pUC19 (Cirino et al., 2003). The use of two different enzymes would\nincrease the accuracy of the construct and facilitate the incorporation of the desired fragment\ninto the plasmid (Hanahan, 1983).\nBased on the information provided by the restriction analyzer, the BamHI enzyme cuts at two\ndifferent sites on genomic DNA (180 and 2865), producing large fragments that appeared as a\nsmear in the gel electrophoresis images (Sorek et al., 2013). HindIII was introduced to cut at an\nadditional site (4130) on genomic DNA, increasing the likelihood that the fragment containing\nthe rspL gene would be successfully incorporated into the plasmid (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nIn summary, the construction of a genomic library using E.coli Top10 genomic DNA and pUC19\nplasmid DNA encountered several challenges throughout the experiment, including low DNA\nconcentrations, contamination, and inefficient transformation (Inoue et al., 1990). The\nintroduction of the HindIII enzyme in addition to BamHI for restriction digestion was expected\nto increase the probability of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene (Cirino et al., 2003).\nFurthermore, troubleshooting in each area of competent cells preparation, ligation reaction,\nand transformation protocol can assist in identifying and rectifying these challenges, such as reevaluating the insert-to-vector ratio, incubation time, and temperature for the ligation reaction\nor testing and optimizing various transformation conditions (Hanahan, 1983).\nFor this experiment, the most likely problem would be with transformation. It could be\noptimized and modified by making changes mentioned below:\na. Temperature and duration: Confirm that the heat shock conditions (e.g. 42\u00b0C for 30-45\nseconds) are appropriate for your cells (Inoue et al., 1990).\nb. Recovery duration: Allow adequate time (usually 1 hour) for the cells to recover and express\nthe antibiotic resistance marker (Sorek et al., 2013).\nc. Optimal antibiotic concentration: Ensure the appropriate concentration of streptomycin for\nselection is used on the plates. Too high or low of a concentration may result in inadequate\nselection (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nPart B write up 16\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nIn addition to the technical challenges faced during the genomic library construction, human\nerrors could also have contributed to the unsuccessful or inconclusive results. These errors can\noccur in sample handling, reagent preparation, equipment usage, and protocol execution. Such\nerrors may include:\n1. Cross-contamination: During handling of samples, there is potential for cross-contamination\nbetween different DNA samples or between the samples and reagents, leading to undesired\nresults (Inoue et al., 1990).\n2. Reagent preparation: Errors can occur while preparing various reagents such as buffers,\nenzyme solutions, or antibiotics. These could include inaccurate measurement or mixing of\ncomponents, resulting in incorrect concentrations that can affect experimental outcomes\n(Sorek et al., 2013).\n3. Pipetting errors: Inaccurate pipetting can lead to incorrect volumes being dispensed, resulting\nin the incorrect sample or reagent concentration, which affects the outcome of experiments\n(Hanahan, 1983).\n4. Equipment usage: Improper operation, maintenance, or calibration of laboratory equipment\ncan generate unreliable or inconsistent results. For instance, inaccurate temperature settings\nfor incubation or heat shock can affect the transformation efficiency (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nTo minimize human errors, it is essential to maintain good laboratory practices, maintaining\nproper organization of the workspace, labeling samples accurately, and double-checking\nreagent concentrations. Additionally, regularly calibrating and maintaining equipment,\nfollowing established protocols carefully, and incorporating appropriate controls into\nexperiments will help reduce the occurrence of human errors and enhance the overall success\nof the genomic library construction process.\nFuture experiments can investigate alternative restriction enzymes, plasmid vectors, and\ncompetent cell strains to improve the overall success of the genomic library construction\nprocess (Cirino et al., 2003). Moreover, ensuring a suitable recovery time for transformed cells,\nproviding a nutrient-rich medium during recovery, using appropriate plating methods and\nconditions, and including positive and negative controls in each transformation experiment will\naid in enhancing the efficiency of the genomic library construction and subsequent functional\nselection of the streptomycin resistance-conferring rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983).\nConclusion\nPart B write up 17\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nIn conclusion, the construction of a genomic library using E.coli Top10 genomic DNA and pUC19\nplasmid DNA proved to be challenging due to several factors, including low DNA\nconcentrations, contamination, and inefficient transformation.

The FastDigest HindIII (thermo\nscientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp)\nutilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically\ncompetent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product\nwill be plated on Ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto\nstreptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property.\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior\nto ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however,\nthroughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be\nthoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the\nmistakes.\nMethods/Materials\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid\npUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET\ngenomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)\nrespectively.\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\nGenomic material A260/A280 A260/A230 DNA Conc.

The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 \u00b5L for both DNA. Elution\nbuffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on\nSimpliNano.\nPart B write up 2\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion\nbut BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI\nwill show same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E.coli as it was the case with K12\nstrain.\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with thermos\nscientific FastDigest BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the\nreagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\nDigestion Reagents pUC19 Top10 (rspL gene)\nGenetic material 2 \u00b5L 10 \u00b5L\nFast digest buffer 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme) 1 \u00b5L 1 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade Water 30 \u00b5L 22 \u00b5L\nTotal Reaction volume 35 \u00b5L 35 \u00b5L\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic\nmaterials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were\nincubated in 37 \u00b0C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 \u00b0C for 10 minutes.\nGel electrophoresis to verify digestion from band sizes:\nThis gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion\nwas successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To\nprepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg BIOTECHNOLOGY GRADE Agarose ITM powder\n(Lot : 19H2056197) in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM (0008-090501.52) for\nvisualization.\n1Kb DNA ladder RTU (Froggo-BIO, BIO-HELIX LOT 14007210104) was used as a standard with\nThermo Scientific 6X loading dye (LOT 00799325). 10 \u00b5L of digested genomic was loaded into\nthe gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light(Midi Blue LED\nTransilluminator), there were no bands visible.\nDNA clean-up:\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab\ninstructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using \u201cThermo Scientific GeneJET Gel\nExtraction and DNA clean up kit\u201d the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was\nintroduced in original clean up protocol which stated \u201c10 \u00b5L of Elution buffer\u201d to elute which\nPart B write up 3\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nwas updated to \u201c15 \u00b5L of Elution Buffer\u201d. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on\nSimpliNano after clean up which indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\nCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\nA260/A230 0.826\nA260/A280 1.609\nng/ \u00b5L 12\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after\nclean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306).\nVolume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 \u00b5L and the blank used was the elution\nbuffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided\nby lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which\nwas then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15 \u00b5L elution\nbuffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table\nbelow.\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\nBefore clean up After clean up\nA260/A280 1.598 1.794\nA260/A230 1.143 2.188\nng/ \u00b5L 28.1 109.6\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA\nprovided by Vanessa.

The table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\nTable 5: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material.\npUC19 Top10 genomic DNA\nConcentration 17.2 ng/ \u00b5L 109.6 ng/ \u00b5L\nGenomic material 4 \u00b5L 5 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Buffer 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nPart B write up 4\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI) 1 \u00b5L 1 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade water 28 \u00b5L 27 \u00b5L\nTotal reaction volume 35 \u00b5L 35 \u00b5L\nThe table gives the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both\ngenetic materials used in this project to construct a genomic library. Both reactions were\nincubated for half an hour in 37 \u00b0C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 \u00b0C for 10 minutes.\nThe digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was\nready.\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared using same supplies however since the\nconcentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 \u00b5L of cut and uncut\ngenomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded.\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut\ngenomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by\nMahan\u2019s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first\nvisualized under UV light (Midi Blue LED Transilluminator) and then under BIOrad software\nwhich will be added in result section.\nLigation with only one reaction:\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the\nfollowing week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic\ntop10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000.\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\nReaction reagents Ligation ratio (1:1)\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA) 3 \u00b5L\nVector (digested pUC19) 3 \u00b5L\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X) 5 \u00b5L\nT4 Ligase 2 \u00b5L\nPEG4000 2 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade water 10 \u00b5L\nTotal reaction volume 25 \u00b5L\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction\nenzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was\nincubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 \u00b0C for 10 minutes. The\nligated product was then stored at -20 \u00b0C until transformation.\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\nPart B write up 5\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To\nproceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 \u00b5L each) were provided by Vanessa\nalong with 4 agar plates.\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one\nexperimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent\ncells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\nTable 7: Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\nReaction Positive control Negative control Experimental\nReagents 50 \u00b5L competent\ncells + 10 \u00b5L pUC19\n50 \u00b5L of competent\ncells\n50\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at\n42 \u00b0C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered.\nMeanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread\nwith 100 \u00b5L of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 \u00b5L of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 \u00b5L of 500 mM IPTG per\nplate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was\nintroduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 \u00b5L\nonto plates, 150 \u00b5L was plated for each to increase the concentration.\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 \u00b0 C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from\nincubator the next day (March 25, 2023).\nThe results of transformation depicted signs of contamination and no white colonies were\npresent. On the assumption that contamination might have masked the ligation results.\nNew transformation using same ligated product:\nThe following week (March 28, 2023), the same ligated product was used for transformation\nusing same supplies as in previous section. No ligation control was set up as there was not\nenough ligated product left. Following exact same procedure the transformation was\ncompleted and plates were incubated at 35 \u0366 C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from\nincubator the next day (March 29, 2023).\nThe results suggested no success since no white colony was visible.\nDigesting with BamHI and HindIII :\nIn the final week (April 4, 2023) of this project, a new digestion reaction was set up using two\nrestriction enzymes that is FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) and FastDigest BamHI (thermo\nscientific).\nThe reaction reagents and volumes used are listed in the table given below\nPart B write up 6\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nTable 9: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material using\ntwo enzymes.\npUC19 Top10 genomic DNA\nConcentration 17.2 ng/ \u00b5L 109.6 ng/ \u00b5L\nGenomic material 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Buffer 1 \u00b5L 1 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI) 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Enzyme (HindIII) 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade water 3 \u00b5L 3 \u00b5L\nTotal reaction volume 10 \u00b5L 10 \u00b5L\nThe table enlists the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both\ngenetic materials with thermos scientific FastDigest BamHI and HindIII. Both digestion reactions\nwere incubated for half an hour in 37 \u00b0C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 \u00b0C for 10\nminutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis\napparatus was ready.\nGel electrophoresis to verify digestion of genomic material using 2 restriction enzymes:\nWhile performing the digestion reactions one team member was setting up the 1% agarose gel\npreparation. To do so, 500 mg BIOTECHNOLOGY GRADE Agarose ITM powder (Lot : 19H2056197)\nwas used in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer. 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM (0008-090501.52) was added to the\nmixture once cool enough.\n1Kb DNA ladder RTU (Froggo-BIO, BIO-HELIX LOT 14007210104) was used as standard.\nAbout 10 \u00b5L of the sample with 2 \u00b5L loading dye was used to load digested genomic top10 ,\ndigested genomic , undigested pUC19 plasmid , digested plasmid were loaded along with the\nstandard using Thermo Scientific 6X loading dye (LOT 00799325). Once the set up was ready\nand the 30 minutes incubation was complete, the 1% gel electrophoresis was performed was 20\nminutes at 120V. On completion the gel was visualized under UV light (Midi Blue LED\nTransilluminator).\nThe gel results were not up to mark but since there was no time to carry out any other\nprocedures this project came to an end.\nResults\nPart B write up 7\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene\nafter digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE\nbuffer with 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for\n1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 \u00b5L loaded as standard whilst the well\nlabelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 \u00b5L digested sample + 2 \u00b5L loading dye). The\nabove gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded\nwhich was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low\nconcentration of genomic DNA.\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM requires at minimum 50 ng/ \u00b5L of the sample\nconcentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was\nunsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was\nalready quite low with 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume\nof 35 \u00b5L we used 10 \u00b5L of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not\nonly this when we loaded 10 \u00b5L digested sample with 2 \u00b5L loading dye it further diluted. As per\nthis, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L which is very less than 50 ng/ \u00b5L as\nper the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\n(33.2 ng / \u00b5L \u00d7 10 \u00b5L in digestion) / (10 \u00b5L while loading) = 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L\n\nPart B write up 8\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nHence, nothing was detected.Furthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10\nwas not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes\nat 120 V under UV light.

These sites give very\nbig fragments that can be seen as smear in image 2.\nThis enzyme cuts at 662 on pUC19 and creates sticky ends. The total size of the plasmid is 2686\nbp. If we incorporate this plasmid inside a host mentioned above, it gives a smear.

The cutting\npositions for BamHI are 180 and 2865 and for HindIII is 4130. We used HindIII to make sure that\nour fragment contains rspL gene.\nImage 9: Information regarding the total length of the plasmid DNA using restriction analyzer\nPart B write up 14\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nThe above image provides information related to the pUC19 plasmid DNA that is 2686 bp long.\nThe tool used for this was restriction analyzer. It also shows that BamHI cuts at 662 position on\nplasmid DNA and HindIII cuts at 632 positions. Since we are using two different enzymes, there\nis a better chance that our fragment contains rspL gene.\nDiscussion\nThe primary objective of this project was to create a genomic library using a streptomycinresistant strain of E.coli Top10 (4537 bp) as the genomic DNA, incorporating it into a pUC19\nplasmid (2686 bp) vector (Cirino et al., 2003). The successful construction of this genomic\nlibrary was expected to confer streptomycin resistance to a recipient E.coli strain Mach1\nthrough the functional selection of the rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983). However, throughout the\nexperiment, several challenges were encountered, leading to changes in the experimental\ndesign and troubleshooting of errors.\nAn initial gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of the rspL gene after digestion\nof genomic DNA with BamHI resulted in no visible bands. This was primarily due to the low\nconcentration of the originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA (33.2 ng/\u00b5L), which was further\ndiluted during the digestion reaction and loading of the gel (Inoue et al., 1990). This\nconcentration was below the minimum detection limit required for the INtRON RedSafeTM\nnucleic acid stain to work efficiently (50 ng/\u00b5L). As a consequence, no bands were detected,\nand the experiment had to be repeated with a new and cleaned up genomic DNA sample.\nSubsequent gel electrophoresis performed after digesting the cleaned-up genomic DNA with\nBamHI showed successful digestion of the genomic Top10 DNA, as evidenced by a shorter\nsmear in comparison to the uncut band of the genomic DNA (Sorek et al., 2013). In addition, the\nplasmid pUC19 showed two very faint bands after digestion with BamHI, indicating appropriate\ndigestion of the plasmid as well.\nPart B write up 15\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nA ligation reaction was set up using a 1:1 ratio for cut genomic Top10 DNA (insert) and cut\nplasmid pUC19 (vector) (Chen & Dubnau, 2004). After overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C, the ligated\nproduct was transformed into Mach1 chemically competent cells. The initial transformation\nresults were inconclusive due to contamination observed in the positive control plate.\nMoreover, the second transformation attempt resulted in an unsuccessful transformation due\nto inefficient uptake of DNA by the host organism, which might have been caused by several\nfactors, such as improper preparation of competent cells, issues concerning the ligation\nreaction, or the transformation protocol itself (Inoue et al., 1990).\nTo increase the likelihood of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene, a third gel\nelectrophoresis was performed using HindIII in addition to BamHI for digesting both genomic\nTop10 DNA and plasmid pUC19 (Cirino et al., 2003). The use of two different enzymes would\nincrease the accuracy of the construct and facilitate the incorporation of the desired fragment\ninto the plasmid (Hanahan, 1983).\nBased on the information provided by the restriction analyzer, the BamHI enzyme cuts at two\ndifferent sites on genomic DNA (180 and 2865), producing large fragments that appeared as a\nsmear in the gel electrophoresis images (Sorek et al., 2013). HindIII was introduced to cut at an\nadditional site (4130) on genomic DNA, increasing the likelihood that the fragment containing\nthe rspL gene would be successfully incorporated into the plasmid (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nIn summary, the construction of a genomic library using E.coli Top10 genomic DNA and pUC19\nplasmid DNA encountered several challenges throughout the experiment, including low DNA\nconcentrations, contamination, and inefficient transformation (Inoue et al., 1990). The\nintroduction of the HindIII enzyme in addition to BamHI for restriction digestion was expected\nto increase the probability of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene (Cirino et al., 2003).\nFurthermore, troubleshooting in each area of competent cells preparation, ligation reaction,\nand transformation protocol can assist in identifying and rectifying these challenges, such as reevaluating the insert-to-vector ratio, incubation time, and temperature for the ligation reaction\nor testing and optimizing various transformation conditions (Hanahan, 1983).\nFor this experiment, the most likely problem would be with transformation. It could be\noptimized and modified by making changes mentioned below:\na. Temperature and duration: Confirm that the heat shock conditions (e.g. 42\u00b0C for 30-45\nseconds) are appropriate for your cells (Inoue et al., 1990).\nb. Recovery duration: Allow adequate time (usually 1 hour) for the cells to recover and express\nthe antibiotic resistance marker (Sorek et al., 2013).\nc. Optimal antibiotic concentration: Ensure the appropriate concentration of streptomycin for\nselection is used on the plates. Too high or low of a concentration may result in inadequate\nselection (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nPart B write up 16\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nIn addition to the technical challenges faced during the genomic library construction, human\nerrors could also have contributed to the unsuccessful or inconclusive results. These errors can\noccur in sample handling, reagent preparation, equipment usage, and protocol execution. Such\nerrors may include:\n1. Cross-contamination: During handling of samples, there is potential for cross-contamination\nbetween different DNA samples or between the samples and reagents, leading to undesired\nresults (Inoue et al., 1990).\n2. Reagent preparation: Errors can occur while preparing various reagents such as buffers,\nenzyme solutions, or antibiotics. These could include inaccurate measurement or mixing of\ncomponents, resulting in incorrect concentrations that can affect experimental outcomes\n(Sorek et al., 2013).\n3. Pipetting errors: Inaccurate pipetting can lead to incorrect volumes being dispensed, resulting\nin the incorrect sample or reagent concentration, which affects the outcome of experiments\n(Hanahan, 1983).\n4. Equipment usage: Improper operation, maintenance, or calibration of laboratory equipment\ncan generate unreliable or inconsistent results. For instance, inaccurate temperature settings\nfor incubation or heat shock can affect the transformation efficiency (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nTo minimize human errors, it is essential to maintain good laboratory practices, maintaining\nproper organization of the workspace, labeling samples accurately, and double-checking\nreagent concentrations. Additionally, regularly calibrating and maintaining equipment,\nfollowing established protocols carefully, and incorporating appropriate controls into\nexperiments will help reduce the occurrence of human errors and enhance the overall success\nof the genomic library construction process.\nFuture experiments can investigate alternative restriction enzymes, plasmid vectors, and\ncompetent cell strains to improve the overall success of the genomic library construction\nprocess (Cirino et al., 2003). Moreover, ensuring a suitable recovery time for transformed cells,\nproviding a nutrient-rich medium during recovery, using appropriate plating methods and\nconditions, and including positive and negative controls in each transformation experiment will\naid in enhancing the efficiency of the genomic library construction and subsequent functional\nselection of the streptomycin resistance-conferring rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983).\nConclusion\nPart B write up 17\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nIn conclusion, the construction of a genomic library using E.coli Top10 genomic DNA and pUC19\nplasmid DNA proved to be challenging due to several factors, including low DNA\nconcentrations, contamination, and inefficient transformation. Optimization of the\ntransformation process, selection of alternative restriction enzymes, plasmid vectors, and\ncompetent cell strains could enhance the overall success of the genomic library construction\nand subsequent functional selection of the streptomycin resistance-conferring rspL gene.\nFuture experiments should also emphasize proper controls, recovery conditions, and nutrientrich media to improve the efficiency of this process."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Slide 1: Title Slide\n- Troubleshooting and Next Steps in Genomic Library Construction\n\nSlide 2: Overview\n- Summary of project and challenges encountered\n- Importance of troubleshooting and optimization\n\nSlide 3: Low DNA Concentrations\n- Effect on gel electrophoresis results\n- Solutions: Clean up methods and optimizing digestion reactions\n\nSlide 4: Contamination Issues\n- Effects on transformation results\n- Solutions: Proper lab practices and appropriate controls\n\nSlide 5: Inefficient Transformation\n- Errors in competent cell preparation, ligation reaction, and transformation protocol\n- Solutions for optimization in these areas discussed in the following slides\n\nSlide 6: Ligation Reaction Optimization\n- Re-evaluating insert-to-vector ratio\n- Adjusting incubation times and temperature\n\nSlide 7: Transformation Conditions Optimization\n- Testing different temperature and duration settings for heat shock\n- Ensuring optimal recovery time for transformed cells\n- Using appropriate antibiotic concentrations for selection\n\nSlide 8: Alternative Experimental Approaches\n- Investigating alternative restriction enzymes, plasmid vectors, and competent cell strains\n\nSlide 9: Ensuring Proper Controls and Recovery Conditions\n- Importance of including positive and negative controls in every experiment\n- Providing nutrient-rich media during recovery and proper plating methods\n\nSlide 10: Conclusion\n- Troubleshooting and optimization are critical for successful genomic library construction\n- Future experiments can enhance efficiency by considering alternative enzymes, plasmids, competent cells, and improving techniques\n\nSlide 11: Next Steps\n1.

You have to write me a script according to that and you can use the information mentioned below to present:\n\nBackground\nThis portion of the lab section involved creating a genomic library using a streptomycin\nresistant strain of E.coli top10 (4537 bp) as the genomic DNA which will be incorporated into\npuc19 plasmid (2686 bp) vector as proposed earlier in PART B proposal document.\nTo achieve the proposed plan, E.coli strain top10 (4537 bp) will serve as the genomic strain that\nwill be the source of streptomycin resistance rspL gene. The FastDigest HindIII (thermo\nscientific) digested fragment will be insert into a digested pUC19 plasmid vector (2686 bp)\nutilizing ligation process. Once ligated, the product will be transformed with Mach1 chemically\ncompetent cells (O.D. value = 0.77). To confirm the success of ligation the transformed product\nwill be plated on Ampillicin/X-gal/IPTG plates and the white colonies will then be streaked onto\nstreptomycin plates to verify the rspl gene streptomycin resistance property.\nAs per the proposal, digesting the bacterial strains with similar digestion enzyme (HindIII) prior\nto ligation followed by transformation would have ideally given the genomic library however,\nthroughout the project certain decisions were changed based on the results which will be\nthoroughly covered in this document along with the solutions taken to troubleshoot the\nmistakes.\nMethods/Materials\nIsolation of genomic DNA and plasmid DNA:\nTo start with the procedure of creating a genomic library from E.coli strain Top10 and plasmid\npUC19, 5 mL genomic DNA (Top10) and 3 mL plasmid pUC19 was isolated using GeneJET\ngenomic DNA purification kit (lot 01319594) and GeneJET plasmid Mini prep kit (lot 01218820)\nrespectively.\nTable 1: Observed concentrations of isolated genomic material using SimpliNano.\nGenomic material A260/A280 A260/A230 DNA Conc. (ng/\u00b5L)\nTop10 1.988 1.644 33.2\npUC19 1.866 1.211 17.2\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentration data for isolated genomic material on\nFeb 21, 2023. The volume of sample loaded in SimpliNano was 2 \u00b5L for both DNA. Elution\nbuffer(01177350 and 00991597) from both respective isolation kits were used as a blank on\nSimpliNano.\nPart B write up 2\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nRestriction Enzyme Digestion:\nAs per part A proposal our group wanted to use HindIII enzyme of restriction enzyme digestion\nbut BamHI was used instead. This was changed because the aim was to check whether BamHI\nwill show same digestion or similar results with strainTop10 of E.coli as it was the case with K12\nstrain.\nBoth genomic DNA from Top10 and plasmid DNA of pUC19 were digested with thermos\nscientific FastDigest BamHI enzyme in second week of this project (March 8, 2023) and the\nreagent volumes used are listed in the table given below.\nTable 2: Reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of genomic material.\nDigestion Reagents pUC19 Top10 (rspL gene)\nGenetic material 2 \u00b5L 10 \u00b5L\nFast digest buffer 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nBamHI (Fast Digest Enzyme) 1 \u00b5L 1 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade Water 30 \u00b5L 22 \u00b5L\nTotal Reaction volume 35 \u00b5L 35 \u00b5L\nThis table summarizes the reagent recipe used for first restriction enzyme digestion of genetic\nmaterials used to create the genomic library. The above listed both digestion reactions were\nincubated in 37 \u00b0C water bath for 30 minutes before heat inactivation at 80 \u00b0C for 10 minutes.\nGel electrophoresis to verify digestion from band sizes:\nThis gel electrophoresis was performed on same day in order to confirm whether the digestion\nwas successful or not and whether the isolated genomic DNA contains the rspL gene. To\nprepare this, 1% gel was prepared using 500 mg BIOTECHNOLOGY GRADE Agarose ITM powder\n(Lot : 19H2056197) in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer with 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM (0008-090501.52) for\nvisualization.\n1Kb DNA ladder RTU (Froggo-BIO, BIO-HELIX LOT 14007210104) was used as a standard with\nThermo Scientific 6X loading dye (LOT 00799325). 10 \u00b5L of digested genomic was loaded into\nthe gel. Gel was run for 20 minutes at 120V. When analyzed under UV light(Midi Blue LED\nTransilluminator), there were no bands visible.\nDNA clean-up:\nSince gel electrophoresis results indicated no bands it was decided with the help of lab\ninstructor to perform a DNA clean up for genomic to concentrate it more.\nOriginally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was cleaned up using \u201cThermo Scientific GeneJET Gel\nExtraction and DNA clean up kit\u201d the following week ( March 14, 2023). A small change was\nintroduced in original clean up protocol which stated \u201c10 \u00b5L of Elution buffer\u201d to elute which\nPart B write up 3\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nwas updated to \u201c15 \u00b5L of Elution Buffer\u201d. Concentration of genomic DNA was checked on\nSimpliNano after clean up which indicated the DNA was lost in clean up process.\nTable 3: Concentration of genomic DNA (Top10) analyzed on SimpliNano after DNA clean up.\nCleaned up genomic Top10 DNA\nA260/A230 0.826\nA260/A280 1.609\nng/ \u00b5L 12\nThe above table lists the concentration of originally isolated genomic DNA of strain Top10 after\nclean-up using Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306).\nVolume of sample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 \u00b5L and the blank used was the elution\nbuffer(LOT 01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\nNew isolated genomic Top10 DNA provided by Vanessa:\nSince the whole genomic DNA was lost therefore another vial of isolated genomic was provided\nby lab instructor. The concentration of new genomic DNA was analyzed on SimpliNano which\nwas then cleaned-up using the same clean up kit with same modification of 15 \u00b5L elution\nbuffer. After clean up the concentration was checked on SimpliNano and is stated in table\nbelow.\nTable 4: Concentration of new genomic Top10 DNA before and after clean-up.\nBefore clean up After clean up\nA260/A280 1.598 1.794\nA260/A230 1.143 2.188\nng/ \u00b5L 28.1 109.6\nThe above table summarizes the observed concentrations of new isolated genomic top10 DNA\nprovided by Vanessa. These concentrations refer to the DNA before using GeneJET genomic\nDNA purification kit with its corresponding elution buffer as blank. Also after clean up using\nThermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction and DNA clean up kit (LOT 2599306). Volume of\nsample loaded on SimpliNano was 2 \u00b5L and the blank used was the elution buffer(LOT\n01307087) from the DNA clean up kit.\nNew Digestion reaction set up with cleaned up genomic DNA:\nThe new digestion was performed using the cleaned up genomic DNA with higher\nconcentration. The table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\nTable 5: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material.\npUC19 Top10 genomic DNA\nConcentration 17.2 ng/ \u00b5L 109.6 ng/ \u00b5L\nGenomic material 4 \u00b5L 5 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Buffer 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nPart B write up 4\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI) 1 \u00b5L 1 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade water 28 \u00b5L 27 \u00b5L\nTotal reaction volume 35 \u00b5L 35 \u00b5L\nThe table gives the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both\ngenetic materials used in this project to construct a genomic library. Both reactions were\nincubated for half an hour in 37 \u00b0C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 \u00b0C for 10 minutes.\nThe digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis apparatus was\nready.\nAnother 1% gel electrophoresis:\nSimilar recipe of 1% gel electrophoresis was prepared using same supplies however since the\nconcentration of newly cleaned genomic DNA was significantly high, only 5 \u00b5L of cut and uncut\ngenomic along with cut plasmid with 6X loading dye was loaded.\nThe 1% gel was shared with another group with ladder in the center followed by uncut\ngenomic, cut genomic and cut plasmid from our samples. First half of the gel was utilized by\nMahan\u2019s group. The gel was run for about 20-25 minutes at 120 V and the results were first\nvisualized under UV light (Midi Blue LED Transilluminator) and then under BIOrad software\nwhich will be added in result section.\nLigation with only one reaction:\nThis was decided to check if the ligation was successful or not which was performed the\nfollowing week (March 21, 2023). To do so, a 1:1 ratio of cut plasmid pUC19 and cut genomic\ntop10 (insert) was ligated using T4 ligase (vector) accompanied with the use of PEG4000.\nThe following table summarizes the reaction reagents and volumes.\nTable 6: Ligation reaction set up for digested insert and vector using T4 ligase.\nReaction reagents Ligation ratio (1:1)\nInsert (digested genomic top10 DNA) 3 \u00b5L\nVector (digested pUC19) 3 \u00b5L\nT4 Ligase Buffer (5X) 5 \u00b5L\nT4 Ligase 2 \u00b5L\nPEG4000 2 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade water 10 \u00b5L\nTotal reaction volume 25 \u00b5L\nThis ligation reagent recipe was used to ligate the insert and vector achieved from restriction\nenzyme digestion of genomic top10 and pUC19 with BamHI. This ligation reaction was\nincubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C and heat inactivated after 24 hours at 65 \u00b0C for 10 minutes. The\nligated product was then stored at -20 \u00b0C until transformation.\nTransformation with Mach 01 strain competent cells:\nPart B write up 5\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nTransformation of the ligated product was performed the same week (March 24, 2023). To\nproceed with transformation, 4 vials of competent cells (50 \u00b5L each) were provided by Vanessa\nalong with 4 agar plates.\nGoal was to plate one positive control, one negative control for validation of results with one\nexperimental in duplicates. Protocol of transformation was used to first thaw the competent\ncells on ice (about 20 minutes) followed by setting up controls and experimental.\nTable 7: Controls and experimental reaction set for transformation of ligated product.\nReaction Positive control Negative control Experimental\nReagents 50 \u00b5L competent\ncells + 10 \u00b5L pUC19\n50 \u00b5L of competent\ncells\n50\nThe transformation reactions were then incubated on ice for 30 minutes prior to heat shock at\n42 \u00b0C for 30 seconds. The reactions were then placed on shaker for 1 hour until recovered.\nMeanwhile, when 30 minutes were left while cells were recovering, 4 agar plates were spread\nwith 100 \u00b5L of 25 mg/mL Ampicillin, 40 \u00b5L of 20 mg/mL X-gal and 8 \u00b5L of 500 mM IPTG per\nplate respectively. After successive completion of 1 hour recovery of cells, one little change was\nintroduced in which the cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. Instead of plating 200 \u00b5L\nonto plates, 150 \u00b5L was plated for each to increase the concentration.\nOnce solidified, all 4 plates were incubated at 35 \u00b0 C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from\nincubator the next day (March 25, 2023).\nThe results of transformation depicted signs of contamination and no white colonies were\npresent. On the assumption that contamination might have masked the ligation results.\nNew transformation using same ligated product:\nThe following week (March 28, 2023), the same ligated product was used for transformation\nusing same supplies as in previous section. No ligation control was set up as there was not\nenough ligated product left. Following exact same procedure the transformation was\ncompleted and plates were incubated at 35 \u0366 C for 24 hours. Plates were retrieved from\nincubator the next day (March 29, 2023).\nThe results suggested no success since no white colony was visible.\nDigesting with BamHI and HindIII :\nIn the final week (April 4, 2023) of this project, a new digestion reaction was set up using two\nrestriction enzymes that is FastDigest HindIII (thermo scientific) and FastDigest BamHI (thermo\nscientific).\nThe reaction reagents and volumes used are listed in the table given below\nPart B write up 6\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nTable 9: The reaction reagents for restriction enzyme digestion of both genomic material using\ntwo enzymes.\npUC19 Top10 genomic DNA\nConcentration 17.2 ng/ \u00b5L 109.6 ng/ \u00b5L\nGenomic material 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Buffer 1 \u00b5L 1 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Enzyme (BamHI) 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nFast Digest Enzyme (HindIII) 2 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5L\nPCR Grade water 3 \u00b5L 3 \u00b5L\nTotal reaction volume 10 \u00b5L 10 \u00b5L\nThe table enlists the reaction volumes that were used to perform enzyme digestion of both\ngenetic materials with thermos scientific FastDigest BamHI and HindIII. Both digestion reactions\nwere incubated for half an hour in 37 \u00b0C water bath prior to heat inactivation at 80 \u00b0C for 10\nminutes. The digestion reactions were then stored in ice bucket until gel electrophoresis\napparatus was ready.\nGel electrophoresis to verify digestion of genomic material using 2 restriction enzymes:\nWhile performing the digestion reactions one team member was setting up the 1% agarose gel\npreparation. To do so, 500 mg BIOTECHNOLOGY GRADE Agarose ITM powder (Lot : 19H2056197)\nwas used in 50 mL 1X TAE buffer. 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM (0008-090501.52) was added to the\nmixture once cool enough.\n1Kb DNA ladder RTU (Froggo-BIO, BIO-HELIX LOT 14007210104) was used as standard.\nAbout 10 \u00b5L of the sample with 2 \u00b5L loading dye was used to load digested genomic top10 ,\ndigested genomic , undigested pUC19 plasmid , digested plasmid were loaded along with the\nstandard using Thermo Scientific 6X loading dye (LOT 00799325). Once the set up was ready\nand the 30 minutes incubation was complete, the 1% gel electrophoresis was performed was 20\nminutes at 120V. On completion the gel was visualized under UV light (Midi Blue LED\nTransilluminator).\nThe gel results were not up to mark but since there was no time to carry out any other\nprocedures this project came to an end.\nResults\nPart B write up 7\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene\nafter digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE\nbuffer with 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye. The well labelled 1 was utilized for\n1Kb plus DNA ladder RTU (FroggoBI0- BIOHELIX), 5 \u00b5L loaded as standard whilst the well\nlabelled 2 contains the digested genomic DNA (10 \u00b5L digested sample + 2 \u00b5L loading dye). The\nabove gel electrophoresis was run at 120 V for 20 minutes. Genomic uncut was not loaded\nwhich was considered an error. Moreover, there were no bands at all and the problem was low\nconcentration of genomic DNA.\nIt was noticed that since INtRON RedSafeTM requires at minimum 50 ng/ \u00b5L of the sample\nconcentration to give any visualization detection effects, the above gel electrophoresis was\nunsuccessful. This is because the concentration of originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA was\nalready quite low with 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L and while preparing the digestion reaction with total volume\nof 35 \u00b5L we used 10 \u00b5L of the genomic DNA which implies that our genomic was diluted. Not\nonly this when we loaded 10 \u00b5L digested sample with 2 \u00b5L loading dye it further diluted. As per\nthis, the concentration of loaded sample was 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L which is very less than 50 ng/ \u00b5L as\nper the RedSafeTM to work efficiently.\nCalculations of digested sample concentration:\n(33.2 ng / \u00b5L \u00d7 10 \u00b5L in digestion) / (10 \u00b5L while loading) = 33.2 ng/ \u00b5L\n\nPart B write up 8\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nHence, nothing was detected.Furthermore, digested pUC19 plasmid and uncut genomic Top10\nwas not loaded and therefore nothing was there to compare which was a mistake.\nImage 2: Second 1% gel electrophoresis performed after digesting newly cleaned genomic DNA.\nThe above image represents the picture captured of 1% gel electrophoresis run for 25 minutes\nat 120 V under UV light.

The cutting\npositions for BamHI are 180 and 2865 and for HindIII is 4130. We used HindIII to make sure that\nour fragment contains rspL gene.\nImage 9: Information regarding the total length of the plasmid DNA using restriction analyzer\nPart B write up 14\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nThe above image provides information related to the pUC19 plasmid DNA that is 2686 bp long.\nThe tool used for this was restriction analyzer. It also shows that BamHI cuts at 662 position on\nplasmid DNA and HindIII cuts at 632 positions. Since we are using two different enzymes, there\nis a better chance that our fragment contains rspL gene.\nDiscussion\nThe primary objective of this project was to create a genomic library using a streptomycinresistant strain of E.coli Top10 (4537 bp) as the genomic DNA, incorporating it into a pUC19\nplasmid (2686 bp) vector (Cirino et al., 2003). The successful construction of this genomic\nlibrary was expected to confer streptomycin resistance to a recipient E.coli strain Mach1\nthrough the functional selection of the rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983). However, throughout the\nexperiment, several challenges were encountered, leading to changes in the experimental\ndesign and troubleshooting of errors.\nAn initial gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of the rspL gene after digestion\nof genomic DNA with BamHI resulted in no visible bands. This was primarily due to the low\nconcentration of the originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA (33.2 ng/\u00b5L), which was further\ndiluted during the digestion reaction and loading of the gel (Inoue et al., 1990). This\nconcentration was below the minimum detection limit required for the INtRON RedSafeTM\nnucleic acid stain to work efficiently (50 ng/\u00b5L). As a consequence, no bands were detected,\nand the experiment had to be repeated with a new and cleaned up genomic DNA sample.\nSubsequent gel electrophoresis performed after digesting the cleaned-up genomic DNA with\nBamHI showed successful digestion of the genomic Top10 DNA, as evidenced by a shorter\nsmear in comparison to the uncut band of the genomic DNA (Sorek et al., 2013). In addition, the\nplasmid pUC19 showed two very faint bands after digestion with BamHI, indicating appropriate\ndigestion of the plasmid as well.\nPart B write up 15\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nA ligation reaction was set up using a 1:1 ratio for cut genomic Top10 DNA (insert) and cut\nplasmid pUC19 (vector) (Chen & Dubnau, 2004). After overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C, the ligated\nproduct was transformed into Mach1 chemically competent cells. The initial transformation\nresults were inconclusive due to contamination observed in the positive control plate.\nMoreover, the second transformation attempt resulted in an unsuccessful transformation due\nto inefficient uptake of DNA by the host organism, which might have been caused by several\nfactors, such as improper preparation of competent cells, issues concerning the ligation\nreaction, or the transformation protocol itself (Inoue et al., 1990).\nTo increase the likelihood of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene, a third gel\nelectrophoresis was performed using HindIII in addition to BamHI for digesting both genomic\nTop10 DNA and plasmid pUC19 (Cirino et al., 2003). The use of two different enzymes would\nincrease the accuracy of the construct and facilitate the incorporation of the desired fragment\ninto the plasmid (Hanahan, 1983).\nBased on the information provided by the restriction analyzer, the BamHI enzyme cuts at two\ndifferent sites on genomic DNA (180 and 2865), producing large fragments that appeared as a\nsmear in the gel electrophoresis images (Sorek et al., 2013). HindIII was introduced to cut at an\nadditional site (4130) on genomic DNA, increasing the likelihood that the fragment containing\nthe rspL gene would be successfully incorporated into the plasmid (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nIn summary, the construction of a genomic library using E.coli Top10 genomic DNA and pUC19\nplasmid DNA encountered several challenges throughout the experiment, including low DNA\nconcentrations, contamination, and inefficient transformation (Inoue et al., 1990). The\nintroduction of the HindIII enzyme in addition to BamHI for restriction digestion was expected\nto increase the probability of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene (Cirino et al., 2003).\nFurthermore, troubleshooting in each area of competent cells preparation, ligation reaction,\nand transformation protocol can assist in identifying and rectifying these challenges, such as reevaluating the insert-to-vector ratio, incubation time, and temperature for the ligation reaction\nor testing and optimizing various transformation conditions (Hanahan, 1983).\nFor this experiment, the most likely problem would be with transformation. It could be\noptimized and modified by making changes mentioned below:\na. Temperature and duration: Confirm that the heat shock conditions (e.g. 42\u00b0C for 30-45\nseconds) are appropriate for your cells (Inoue et al., 1990).\nb. Recovery duration: Allow adequate time (usually 1 hour) for the cells to recover and express\nthe antibiotic resistance marker (Sorek et al., 2013).\nc. Optimal antibiotic concentration: Ensure the appropriate concentration of streptomycin for\nselection is used on the plates. Too high or low of a concentration may result in inadequate\nselection (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nPart B write up 16\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nIn addition to the technical challenges faced during the genomic library construction, human\nerrors could also have contributed to the unsuccessful or inconclusive results. These errors can\noccur in sample handling, reagent preparation, equipment usage, and protocol execution. Such\nerrors may include:\n1. Cross-contamination: During handling of samples, there is potential for cross-contamination\nbetween different DNA samples or between the samples and reagents, leading to undesired\nresults (Inoue et al., 1990).\n2. Reagent preparation: Errors can occur while preparing various reagents such as buffers,\nenzyme solutions, or antibiotics. These could include inaccurate measurement or mixing of\ncomponents, resulting in incorrect concentrations that can affect experimental outcomes\n(Sorek et al., 2013).\n3. Pipetting errors: Inaccurate pipetting can lead to incorrect volumes being dispensed, resulting\nin the incorrect sample or reagent concentration, which affects the outcome of experiments\n(Hanahan, 1983).\n4. Equipment usage: Improper operation, maintenance, or calibration of laboratory equipment\ncan generate unreliable or inconsistent results. For instance, inaccurate temperature settings\nfor incubation or heat shock can affect the transformation efficiency (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nTo minimize human errors, it is essential to maintain good laboratory practices, maintaining\nproper organization of the workspace, labeling samples accurately, and double-checking\nreagent concentrations. Additionally, regularly calibrating and maintaining equipment,\nfollowing established protocols carefully, and incorporating appropriate controls into\nexperiments will help reduce the occurrence of human errors and enhance the overall success\nof the genomic library construction process.\nFuture experiments can investigate alternative restriction enzymes, plasmid vectors, and\ncompetent cell strains to improve the overall success of the genomic library construction\nprocess (Cirino et al., 2003).

The cutting\npositions for BamHI are 180 and 2865 and for HindIII is 4130.

It also shows that BamHI cuts at 662 position on\nplasmid DNA and HindIII cuts at 632 positions. Since we are using two different enzymes, there\nis a better chance that our fragment contains rspL gene.\nDiscussion\nThe primary objective of this project was to create a genomic library using a streptomycinresistant strain of E.coli Top10 (4537 bp) as the genomic DNA, incorporating it into a pUC19\nplasmid (2686 bp) vector (Cirino et al., 2003). The successful construction of this genomic\nlibrary was expected to confer streptomycin resistance to a recipient E.coli strain Mach1\nthrough the functional selection of the rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983). However, throughout the\nexperiment, several challenges were encountered, leading to changes in the experimental\ndesign and troubleshooting of errors.\nAn initial gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of the rspL gene after digestion\nof genomic DNA with BamHI resulted in no visible bands. This was primarily due to the low\nconcentration of the originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA (33.2 ng/\u00b5L), which was further\ndiluted during the digestion reaction and loading of the gel (Inoue et al., 1990). This\nconcentration was below the minimum detection limit required for the INtRON RedSafeTM\nnucleic acid stain to work efficiently (50 ng/\u00b5L). As a consequence, no bands were detected,\nand the experiment had to be repeated with a new and cleaned up genomic DNA sample.\nSubsequent gel electrophoresis performed after digesting the cleaned-up genomic DNA with\nBamHI showed successful digestion of the genomic Top10 DNA, as evidenced by a shorter\nsmear in comparison to the uncut band of the genomic DNA (Sorek et al., 2013). In addition, the\nplasmid pUC19 showed two very faint bands after digestion with BamHI, indicating appropriate\ndigestion of the plasmid as well.\nPart B write up 15\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nA ligation reaction was set up using a 1:1 ratio for cut genomic Top10 DNA (insert) and cut\nplasmid pUC19 (vector) (Chen & Dubnau, 2004). After overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C, the ligated\nproduct was transformed into Mach1 chemically competent cells. The initial transformation\nresults were inconclusive due to contamination observed in the positive control plate.\nMoreover, the second transformation attempt resulted in an unsuccessful transformation due\nto inefficient uptake of DNA by the host organism, which might have been caused by several\nfactors, such as improper preparation of competent cells, issues concerning the ligation\nreaction, or the transformation protocol itself (Inoue et al., 1990).\nTo increase the likelihood of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene, a third gel\nelectrophoresis was performed using HindIII in addition to BamHI for digesting both genomic\nTop10 DNA and plasmid pUC19 (Cirino et al., 2003). The use of two different enzymes would\nincrease the accuracy of the construct and facilitate the incorporation of the desired fragment\ninto the plasmid (Hanahan, 1983).\nBased on the information provided by the restriction analyzer, the BamHI enzyme cuts at two\ndifferent sites on genomic DNA (180 and 2865), producing large fragments that appeared as a\nsmear in the gel electrophoresis images (Sorek et al., 2013). HindIII was introduced to cut at an\nadditional site (4130) on genomic DNA, increasing the likelihood that the fragment containing\nthe rspL gene would be successfully incorporated into the plasmid (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nIn summary, the construction of a genomic library using E.coli Top10 genomic DNA and pUC19\nplasmid DNA encountered several challenges throughout the experiment, including low DNA\nconcentrations, contamination, and inefficient transformation (Inoue et al., 1990). The\nintroduction of the HindIII enzyme in addition to BamHI for restriction digestion was expected\nto increase the probability of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene (Cirino et al., 2003).\nFurthermore, troubleshooting in each area of competent cells preparation, ligation reaction,\nand transformation protocol can assist in identifying and rectifying these challenges, such as reevaluating the insert-to-vector ratio, incubation time, and temperature for the ligation reaction\nor testing and optimizing various transformation conditions (Hanahan, 1983).\nFor this experiment, the most likely problem would be with transformation. It could be\noptimized and modified by making changes mentioned below:\na. Temperature and duration: Confirm that the heat shock conditions (e.g. 42\u00b0C for 30-45\nseconds) are appropriate for your cells (Inoue et al., 1990).\nb. Recovery duration: Allow adequate time (usually 1 hour) for the cells to recover and express\nthe antibiotic resistance marker (Sorek et al., 2013).\nc. Optimal antibiotic concentration: Ensure the appropriate concentration of streptomycin for\nselection is used on the plates. Too high or low of a concentration may result in inadequate\nselection (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nPart B write up 16\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nIn addition to the technical challenges faced during the genomic library construction, human\nerrors could also have contributed to the unsuccessful or inconclusive results. These errors can\noccur in sample handling, reagent preparation, equipment usage, and protocol execution. Such\nerrors may include:\n1. Cross-contamination: During handling of samples, there is potential for cross-contamination\nbetween different DNA samples or between the samples and reagents, leading to undesired\nresults (Inoue et al., 1990).\n2. Reagent preparation: Errors can occur while preparing various reagents such as buffers,\nenzyme solutions, or antibiotics. These could include inaccurate measurement or mixing of\ncomponents, resulting in incorrect concentrations that can affect experimental outcomes\n(Sorek et al., 2013).\n3. Pipetting errors: Inaccurate pipetting can lead to incorrect volumes being dispensed, resulting\nin the incorrect sample or reagent concentration, which affects the outcome of experiments\n(Hanahan, 1983).\n4. Equipment usage: Improper operation, maintenance, or calibration of laboratory equipment\ncan generate unreliable or inconsistent results. For instance, inaccurate temperature settings\nfor incubation or heat shock can affect the transformation efficiency (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nTo minimize human errors, it is essential to maintain good laboratory practices, maintaining\nproper organization of the workspace, labeling samples accurately, and double-checking\nreagent concentrations. Additionally, regularly calibrating and maintaining equipment,\nfollowing established protocols carefully, and incorporating appropriate controls into\nexperiments will help reduce the occurrence of human errors and enhance the overall success\nof the genomic library construction process.\nFuture experiments can investigate alternative restriction enzymes, plasmid vectors, and\ncompetent cell strains to improve the overall success of the genomic library construction\nprocess (Cirino et al., 2003). Moreover, ensuring a suitable recovery time for transformed cells,\nproviding a nutrient-rich medium during recovery, using appropriate plating methods and\nconditions, and including positive and negative controls in each transformation experiment will\naid in enhancing the efficiency of the genomic library construction and subsequent functional\nselection of the streptomycin resistance-conferring rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983).\n\n\naccording to the above results and discussion, give me a step by step presentation slides keeping in mind the criteria below:\n\nTroubleshooting and Next Steps\n\u2022 Discussion of results (10)\no Possible reasons of error, possible optimization\n\u2022 Discuss next steps to proceed forward in the experiment (3)\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Slide 1: Title Slide\n- Troubleshooting and Next Steps: Constructing a Genomic Library using E.coli Top10 and pUC19\n\nSlide 2: Key Results\n- Low DNA concentrations\n- Ineffective digestion\n- Contamination issues\n- Inefficient transformation\n\nSlide 3: Troubleshooting - DNA Concentrations\n- Optimize DNA isolation and cleanup protocols\n- Confirm DNA concentrations using spectrophotometry\n- Consider using concentration methods (e.g., ethanol precipitation) to increase DNA yield\n\nSlide 4: Troubleshooting - Digestion\n- Troubleshoot enzyme activity\n- Optimize digestion conditions (e.g., buffer composition, temperature, and incubation time)\n- Confirm the presence of correct restriction sites\n- Explore alternative restriction enzymes\n\nSlide 5: Troubleshooting - Contamination\n- Maintain good laboratory practices\n- Properly sterilize equipment and reagents\n- Incorporate appropriate negative controls to track contamination sources\n\nSlide 6: Troubleshooting - Transformation\n- Optimize competent cell preparation\n- Modify ligation ratio and incubation conditions\n- Re-evaluate heat-shock conditions for maximal transformation efficiency\n\nSlide 7: Next Steps - Restriction Enzymes\n- Investigate alternative restriction enzymes for enhanced digestion efficiency\n- Include additional enzymes, such as HindIII, to increase the likelihood of capturing the rspL gene fragment\n\nSlide 8: Next Steps - Plasmid Vectors and Competent Cell Strains\n- Explore alternative plasmid vectors and competent cell strains for improved transformation success\n\nSlide 9: Next Steps - Recovery and Plating Conditions\n- Ensure a suitable recovery time for transformed cells\n- Provide a nutrient-rich medium during recovery\n- Optimize plating methods and conditions\n- Include positive and negative controls in each transformation experiment\n\nSlide 10: In Conclusion\n- Troubleshooting and optimization are critical for successful genomic library construction\n- Future experiments should focus on refining protocols, analyzing results accurately, and implementing appropriate controls to enhance overall efficiency\n- Continued exploration of alternative enzymes, vectors, and strains will contribute to improved success rates for functional selection of the streptomycin resistance-conferring rspL gene"}]}, {"facetValue": "summarize and present the results and discussion of a genomic library construction experiment, focusing on the gel electrophoresis, transformation process, and troubleshooting steps.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "summarize and present the results and discussion of a genomic library construction experiment, focusing on the gel electrophoresis, transformation process, and troubleshooting steps."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "summarize and explain the experimental process and issues encountered in constructing a genomic library."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "Results\nPart B write up 7\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nImage 1: Picture of first 1% gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of rspL gene\nafter digestion of genomic DNA with BamHI\nThe above image was captured from UV light analysis of the 1% agarose gel prepared in 1X TAE\nbuffer with 2.5 \u00b5L INtRON RedSafeTM and 6X loading dye.

Since we are using two different enzymes, there\nis a better chance that our fragment contains rspL gene.\nDiscussion\nThe primary objective of this project was to create a genomic library using a streptomycinresistant strain of E.coli Top10 (4537 bp) as the genomic DNA, incorporating it into a pUC19\nplasmid (2686 bp) vector (Cirino et al., 2003). The successful construction of this genomic\nlibrary was expected to confer streptomycin resistance to a recipient E.coli strain Mach1\nthrough the functional selection of the rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983). However, throughout the\nexperiment, several challenges were encountered, leading to changes in the experimental\ndesign and troubleshooting of errors.\nAn initial gel electrophoresis performed to confirm the presence of the rspL gene after digestion\nof genomic DNA with BamHI resulted in no visible bands. This was primarily due to the low\nconcentration of the originally isolated genomic Top10 DNA (33.2 ng/\u00b5L), which was further\ndiluted during the digestion reaction and loading of the gel (Inoue et al., 1990). This\nconcentration was below the minimum detection limit required for the INtRON RedSafeTM\nnucleic acid stain to work efficiently (50 ng/\u00b5L). As a consequence, no bands were detected,\nand the experiment had to be repeated with a new and cleaned up genomic DNA sample.\nSubsequent gel electrophoresis performed after digesting the cleaned-up genomic DNA with\nBamHI showed successful digestion of the genomic Top10 DNA, as evidenced by a shorter\nsmear in comparison to the uncut band of the genomic DNA (Sorek et al., 2013). In addition, the\nplasmid pUC19 showed two very faint bands after digestion with BamHI, indicating appropriate\ndigestion of the plasmid as well.\nPart B write up 15\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nA ligation reaction was set up using a 1:1 ratio for cut genomic Top10 DNA (insert) and cut\nplasmid pUC19 (vector) (Chen & Dubnau, 2004). After overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C, the ligated\nproduct was transformed into Mach1 chemically competent cells. The initial transformation\nresults were inconclusive due to contamination observed in the positive control plate.\nMoreover, the second transformation attempt resulted in an unsuccessful transformation due\nto inefficient uptake of DNA by the host organism, which might have been caused by several\nfactors, such as improper preparation of competent cells, issues concerning the ligation\nreaction, or the transformation protocol itself (Inoue et al., 1990).\nTo increase the likelihood of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene, a third gel\nelectrophoresis was performed using HindIII in addition to BamHI for digesting both genomic\nTop10 DNA and plasmid pUC19 (Cirino et al., 2003). The use of two different enzymes would\nincrease the accuracy of the construct and facilitate the incorporation of the desired fragment\ninto the plasmid (Hanahan, 1983).\nBased on the information provided by the restriction analyzer, the BamHI enzyme cuts at two\ndifferent sites on genomic DNA (180 and 2865), producing large fragments that appeared as a\nsmear in the gel electrophoresis images (Sorek et al., 2013). HindIII was introduced to cut at an\nadditional site (4130) on genomic DNA, increasing the likelihood that the fragment containing\nthe rspL gene would be successfully incorporated into the plasmid (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nIn summary, the construction of a genomic library using E.coli Top10 genomic DNA and pUC19\nplasmid DNA encountered several challenges throughout the experiment, including low DNA\nconcentrations, contamination, and inefficient transformation (Inoue et al., 1990). The\nintroduction of the HindIII enzyme in addition to BamHI for restriction digestion was expected\nto increase the probability of obtaining a fragment containing the rspL gene (Cirino et al., 2003).\nFurthermore, troubleshooting in each area of competent cells preparation, ligation reaction,\nand transformation protocol can assist in identifying and rectifying these challenges, such as reevaluating the insert-to-vector ratio, incubation time, and temperature for the ligation reaction\nor testing and optimizing various transformation conditions (Hanahan, 1983).\nFor this experiment, the most likely problem would be with transformation. It could be\noptimized and modified by making changes mentioned below:\na. Temperature and duration: Confirm that the heat shock conditions (e.g. 42\u00b0C for 30-45\nseconds) are appropriate for your cells (Inoue et al., 1990).\nb. Recovery duration: Allow adequate time (usually 1 hour) for the cells to recover and express\nthe antibiotic resistance marker (Sorek et al., 2013).\nc. Optimal antibiotic concentration: Ensure the appropriate concentration of streptomycin for\nselection is used on the plates. Too high or low of a concentration may result in inadequate\nselection (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nPart B write up 16\nJetul and Japneet April 9, 2023\nIn addition to the technical challenges faced during the genomic library construction, human\nerrors could also have contributed to the unsuccessful or inconclusive results. These errors can\noccur in sample handling, reagent preparation, equipment usage, and protocol execution. Such\nerrors may include:\n1. Cross-contamination: During handling of samples, there is potential for cross-contamination\nbetween different DNA samples or between the samples and reagents, leading to undesired\nresults (Inoue et al., 1990).\n2. Reagent preparation: Errors can occur while preparing various reagents such as buffers,\nenzyme solutions, or antibiotics. These could include inaccurate measurement or mixing of\ncomponents, resulting in incorrect concentrations that can affect experimental outcomes\n(Sorek et al., 2013).\n3. Pipetting errors: Inaccurate pipetting can lead to incorrect volumes being dispensed, resulting\nin the incorrect sample or reagent concentration, which affects the outcome of experiments\n(Hanahan, 1983).\n4. Equipment usage: Improper operation, maintenance, or calibration of laboratory equipment\ncan generate unreliable or inconsistent results. For instance, inaccurate temperature settings\nfor incubation or heat shock can affect the transformation efficiency (Chen & Dubnau, 2004).\nTo minimize human errors, it is essential to maintain good laboratory practices, maintaining\nproper organization of the workspace, labeling samples accurately, and double-checking\nreagent concentrations. Additionally, regularly calibrating and maintaining equipment,\nfollowing established protocols carefully, and incorporating appropriate controls into\nexperiments will help reduce the occurrence of human errors and enhance the overall success\nof the genomic library construction process.\nFuture experiments can investigate alternative restriction enzymes, plasmid vectors, and\ncompetent cell strains to improve the overall success of the genomic library construction\nprocess (Cirino et al., 2003). Moreover, ensuring a suitable recovery time for transformed cells,\nproviding a nutrient-rich medium during recovery, using appropriate plating methods and\nconditions, and including positive and negative controls in each transformation experiment will\naid in enhancing the efficiency of the genomic library construction and subsequent functional\nselection of the streptomycin resistance-conferring rspL gene (Hanahan, 1983).\n\n\naccording to the above results and discussion, give me a step by step presentation slides,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Slide 1: Title Slide\n- Genomic Library Construction: The Role of Restriction Enzymes and Transformation Success\n\nSlide 2: Objective\n- Construct a genomic library using E.coli Top10 genomic DNA and pUC19 plasmid DNA\n- Confer streptomycin resistance to a recipient E.coli strain Mach1 through the functional selection of the rspL gene\n\nSlide 3: Initial Gel Electrophoresis\n- Introduce first gel electrophoresis attempt using digested genomic DNA and BamHI\n- Show Image 1\n- Explain the error due to low concentration of genomic Top10 DNA\n\nSlide 4: Second Gel Electrophoresis\n- Introduce cleaned-up genomic DNA sample and repeat gel electrophoresis\n- Show Image 2 and Image 3\n- Discuss successful digestion of genomic Top10 DNA and plasmid pUC19\n\nSlide 5: Ligation Reaction Setup\n- Explain the 1:1 ratio for cut genomic Top10 DNA (insert) and cut plasmid pUC19 (vector)\n- Discuss overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C\n\nSlide 6: Transformation Results (Attempt 1)\n- Show Image 4\n- Mention contamination in the positive control plate\n\nSlide 7: Transformation Results (Attempt 2)\n- Show Image 5\n- Highlight unsuccessful transformation results due to inefficient uptake of DNA by the host organism\n\nSlide 8: Third Gel Electrophoresis with HindIII and BamHI\n- Introduce the addition of HindIII to increase the likelihood of obtaining the fragment containing the rspL gene\n- Show Image 6\n- Discuss cutting positions for genomic Top10 DNA and plasmid pUC19 using both enzymes (refer to Image 7, Image 8, and Image 9)\n\nSlide 9: Troubleshooting Transformation\n- Discuss possible issues with competent cells preparation, ligation reaction, and transformation protocol\n- Mention potential improvements, such as temperature and duration, recovery duration, and optimal antibiotic concentration\n\nSlide 10: Addressing Human Errors\n- Include points about sample handling, reagent preparation, pipetting errors, and equipment usage\n- Suggest ways to minimize these errors\n\nSlide 11: Future Directions\n- Explore alternative restriction enzymes, plasmid vectors, and competent cell strains\n- Ensure proper recovery time, nutrient-rich medium, and appropriate plating methods\n- Include positive and negative controls in all experiments\n\nSlide 12: Questions & Conclusion\n- Open the floor for questions and wrap up the presentation"}, {"role": "user", "content": "will I be able to cover this much information in just 5 minutes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It may be a challenge to cover all the information in just 5 minutes.

Here's an article on genomes:\n\nGenomes: The Building Blocks of Life\n\nA genome is the complete set of genetic instructions for an organism. It contains all the genes necessary to form an individual and control how it develops and functions. These genetic instructions are encoded in the DNA molecules that make up the genome. Genomes can vary in size, shape, and complexity across different types of organisms.\n\nIn humans, the genome consists of about 3 billion base pairs of DNA, which are arranged into 23 pairs of chromosomes. Other organisms, such as bacteria, have much smaller genomes that are typically a few million base pairs in length. On the other end of the spectrum, some plants have genomes that are hundreds of times larger than those of humans.\n\nThe genome is a vital component of life as we know it. It serves as the blueprint for how an organism develops and functions, controlling everything from physical traits like eye color and height to the production of enzymes and other proteins necessary for metabolism.\n\nResearchers study genomes to better understand the fundamental principles of biology and to improve our ability to diagnose and treat disease. Advances in genome sequencing technology have made it possible to sequence the entire genome of an organism relatively quickly and at an affordable cost.\n\nThe Human Genome Project, launched in 1990, was a massive effort to sequence the entire human genome. It was completed in 2003, and scientists have since made significant advances in understanding how our genes contribute to health and disease. For example, genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of genetic variants associated with complex diseases like diabetes and cancer.\n\nGenomes are not static; they can change over time through mutations and other genetic processes. These changes can be beneficial, allowing an organism to adapt to new environments or take advantage of new opportunities. However, some mutations can be harmful and lead to disease or other negative outcomes.\n\nGenomes also play a role in evolution. Over time, mutations accumulate in populations, leading to new genetic variants and ultimately, new species. By studying genomes, researchers can learn about the evolutionary history of different organisms and how they are related to each other.\n\nOverall, genomes are a critical component of life on Earth. They encode the genetic instructions that allow organisms to develop and function, and studying them can provide insights into how life has evolved and how we can improve our health and wellbeing."}]}, {"facetValue": "receive detailed information on how to construct a phage library, specifically an antibody phage library, the process of synthesizing the first strand of cDNA, and

KM, la constante de Michaelis, est la concentration de substrat \u00e0 laquelle la vitesse de la r\u00e9action enzymatique atteint la moiti\u00e9 de sa valeur maximale (Vmax/2). KM fournit une id\u00e9e de l'affinit\u00e9 entre l'enzyme et le substrat, avec une faible valeur de KM indiquant une forte affinit\u00e9 et une valeur \u00e9lev\u00e9e de KM indiquant une faible affinit\u00e9."}]}, {"facetValue": "learn about heat-stable enzymes, LAMP technology for SNP detection, and how to design primers for LAMP reactions.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "learn about heat-stable enzymes, LAMP technology for SNP detection, and how to design primers for LAMP reactions."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "provide references and explanations for scientific and technical topics."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u9176"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u9176\uff08Thermolabile enzyme\uff09\u662f\u6307\u5177\u6709\u70ed\u654f\u6027\u7684\u9176\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u9ad8\u6e29\u4e0b\u5f80\u5f80\u4f1a\u5931\u6d3b\u6216\u5931\u53bb\u50ac\u5316\u6d3b\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9176\u7684\u6d3b\u6027\u5f80\u5f80\u53d7\u5230\u6e29\u5ea6\u7684\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u6b63\u5e38\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u6e29\u4e0b\u4f1a\u88ab\u8fc5\u901f\u5931\u6d3b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6709\u4e9b\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u9176\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u5176\u539f\u59cb\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u5316\u5b66\u4fee\u9970\u6216\u5f15\u5165\u7a81\u53d8\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8010\u70ed\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u50ac\u5316\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\u70ed\u7a33\u5b9a\u9176\u3002\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u9176\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8ePCR\u6269\u589e\u3001DNA\u91cd\u7ec4\u3001\u5236\u5907DNA\u6d4b\u5e8f\u6a21\u677f\u7b49\u751f\u7269\u6280\u672f\u9886\u57df\u3002"}, {"role": "user", "content": "lamp\u6280\u672f\u68c0\u6d4bsnp"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal amplification) \u6280\u672f\u539f\u7406\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u9176\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5c06\u76ee\u6807DNA\u5e8f\u5217\u6269\u589e\u6210\u4e3a\u6570\u4ebf\u4efd\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u800c\u7279\u5f02\u7684DNA\u5fae\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8fbe\u5230\u5feb\u901f\u68c0\u6d4b\u76ee\u7684\uff0c\u5b83\u5177\u6709\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7b80\u5355\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8f83\u5c11\u7b49\u3002\n\nLAMP\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bb8\u591a\u7c7b\u578b\u7684SNP\u3002\u4e00\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u5f02\u5f15\u7269\u6765\u6269\u589e\u5305\u542bSNP\u7684\u76ee\u6807 DNA \u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u8367\u5149\u63a2\u9488\u8bc6\u522b\u6269\u589e\u4ea7\u7269\u4e2d\u7684SNP\u3002\u5728SNP\u4f4d\u70b9\u4e3a\u6838\u82f7\u9178A\u65f6\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8367\u5149\u63a2\u9488\u4e0e\u6269\u589e\u4ea7\u7269\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53d1\u51fa\u7eff\u8272\u8367\u5149\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u53cd\u4e4b\uff0c\u5f53\u4f4d\u70b9\u4e3aC\u65f6\uff0c\u5219\u63a2\u9488\u65e0\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6b64\u65f6\u53d1\u51fa\u9ec4\u8272\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u5bdf\u8367\u5149\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u5224\u65ad\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u5e94\u7684SNP\u3002\n\nLAMP\u6280\u672f\u5728SNP\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u56e0\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u836f\u7269\u4ee3\u8c22\u3001\u9884\u9632\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u751f\u547d\u79d1\u5b66\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\u53c2\u8003\u8d44\u6599"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1.

These biosensors are based on the electrochemical properties of nucleic acids or hybridization events, and can provide a low-cost, portable, and rapid alternative to traditional PCR detection techniques.\n\nOne recent trend in electrochemical biosensor development for PCR product detection is the use of nanomaterial-based sensing platforms, such as gold nanoparticles, graphene, and carbon nanotubes. These nanomaterials can provide enhanced sensitivity and specificity due to their high surface area to volume ratio, tunable electronic properties, and ability to facilitate electron transfer reactions.\n\nAnother recent advance is the development of multiplexed electrochemical biosensors that can simultaneously detect multiple PCR products in a single reaction chamber. Multiplexed biosensors can significantly increase assay throughput and reduce analysis time and cost, making them ideal for high-throughput screening applications.\n\nIn addition, there is a growing interest in the integration of electrochemical biosensors with microfluidic devices for automated sample handling and analysis. Microfluidic devices can provide fast and precise control of fluid flow, and can significantly reduce sample consumption and processing time.\n\nOverall, recent advances in electrochemical biosensors
