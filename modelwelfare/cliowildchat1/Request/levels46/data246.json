The subregion covers an area of more than 2,000 square miles, consisting of a sprawling network of underwater cities, enchanting coral reefs, and mysterious sunken ruins. Aquarlia's shallower areas are characterized by mesmerizing bioluminescent plants, creating a dazzling display of colors that grow in intensity the deeper one ventures.\n\nClimate: The climate of Aquarlia is predominantly warm and tropical. The underwater kingdom is bathed in a steady supply of sunlight, resulting in a stable and comfortable environment for its inhabitants. The constant ocean currents maintain the temperature and ensure that the waters remain clean and clear.\n\nFauna: The aquatic life in Aquarlia is diverse and unique, featuring many species that are not found anywhere else. Merfolk, sea elves, and aquatic humanoids make up the majority of the population. Other notable species include the playful sea dragons, massive whales with cities built on their backs, and sentient schools of fish that communicate via bioluminescence. Aquarlia's coral reefs host a myriad of smaller creatures, making it a hub of biodiversity in the ocean.\n\nFlora: The flora of Aquarlia is just as diverse and wondrous as the fauna. The coral reefs, comprising hard and soft corals, create a variety of habitats for small fish and other creatures. Aquatic plants flourish in the sunlit zones of the ocean, providing food and oxygen for many species. Some plants display bioluminescent properties, offering a stunning sight at night.\n\nInhabitants: There is a wide range of inhabitants in Aquarlia, from the peaceful merfolk to the warlike sahuagin. Alongside them, the sea elves and tritons form a critical part of the ecosystem with their guardianship of the ocean's plants and creatures. While conflicts between different underwater races do arise, a sense of unity and interdependence ensures the preservation of Aquarlia's environment.\n\nSettlements: There are numerous underwater cities spread throughout Aquarlia, each providing a range of bright and colorful architecture, reminiscent of the vibrant reef formations surrounding them. These cities are carefully designed to blend with the natural environment, ensuring that their inhabitants can live in harmony with the ocean. Popular settlements include the merfolk city of Calypsaris, the sea-dwelling elven city of Sylphinaste, and the sunken ancient city of Inara'thul, home to lost relics and magical artifacts.\n\nPolitics: Aquarlia is governed by a marine council formed by delegates from each of the major settlements. Every three years, a new High Tide Queen is elected to lead the council, representing the interests of all inhabitants in Aquarlia. The marine council is responsible for resolving disputes, creating laws, negotiating trade deals, and coordinating defense against aquatic threats.\n\nEconomy: Aquarlia's economy is reliant on its aquatic resources, with industries such as fishing and magic-imbued pearls being prominent. Merchants from different settlements engage in trade using an underwater currency, known as \"sea coins,\" created by combining metals with the magic of the ocean's depths, allowing them to function properly underwater. Interspecies trade occurs with more significant civilizations on land or with amphibious coastal cities, facilitating the exchange of dried seaweed, valuable pearls, magical sea dragon scales, and other unique goods, in return for metals, textiles, or other goods that are not naturally produced underwater.\n\nCulture: The rich culture of Aquarlia is deeply connected to the ocean's mysteries and the magic hidden within its depths. Festivals and celebrations often revolve around the cycles of the moon, which has great influence over the ocean's tides. Music, dance, and storytelling are essential aspects of Aquarlian culture, reflecting their love for the arts and the beauty of their aquatic world. Aquatic sports and underwater races are favorite pastimes for the inhabitants, allowing them to demonstrate their swift swimming skills and powerful underwater abilities.\n\nThreats: Aquarlia faces several threats, including sea creature attacks, ancient curses, and rival groups vying for power. The marine council has formed an underwater defense force to combat such challenges, consisting of elite merfolk warriors, sea elven mages, and triton emissaries. Coordinated efforts from Aquarlia's inhabitants allow them to maintain a powerful defense against these threats, ensuring the safety and tranquility of their underwater paradise."}]}, {"facetValue": "confirm if the water is freezing based on the given scenario.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "confirm if the water is freezing based on the given scenario."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "generate humorous responses to the question \"Isn't the water freezing?\""}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "Answer as person to this question.

Please provide me with the context you mentioned so I can assist you with the questions."}, {"role": "user", "content": "the is the context:Lake Water\nWhere does the water in a lake come from, and how does water leave it? Water\nenters a lake from inflowing rivers, from underwater seeps and springs, from overland\nflow off the surrounding land, and from rain falling directly on the lake surface. Water\nleaves a lake via outflowing rivers, by soaking into the bed of the lake, and by\nevaporation. So much is obvious.\nThe questions become more complicated when actual volumes of water are\nconsidered: how much water enters and leaves by each route? Discovering the inputs\nand outputs of rivers is a matter of measuring the discharges of every inflowing and\noutflowing stream and river. Then exchanges with the atmosphere are calculated by\nfinding the difference between the gains from rain, as measured (rather roughly) by rain\ngauges, and the losses by evaporation, measured with models that correct for the other\nsources of water loss. For the majority of lakes, certainly those surrounded by forests,\ninput from overland flow is too small to have a noticeable effect. Changes in lake level\nnot explained by river flows plus exchanges with the atmosphere must be due to the net\ndifference between what seeps into the lake from the groundwater and what leaks into\nthe groundwater. Note the word \"net\": measuring the actual amounts of groundwater\nseepage into the lake and out of the lake is a much more complicated matter than merely\ninferring their difference.\nOnce all this information has been gathered, it becomes possible to judge whether a\nlake\u2019s flow is mainly due to its surface inputs and outputs or to its underground inputs\nand outputs. If the former are greater, the lake is a surface-water-dominated lake; if the\nlatter, it is a seepage-dominated lake. Occasionally, common sense tells you which of\nthese two possibilities applies. For example, a pond in hilly country that maintains a\nsteady water level all through a dry summer in spite of having no streams flowing into\nit must obviously be seepage dominated. Conversely, a pond with a stream flowing in\none end and out the other, which dries up when the stream dries up, is clearly surface\nwater dominated.\nBy whatever means, a lake is constantly gaining water and losing water: its water\ndoes not just sit there, or, anyway, not for long. This raises the matter of a lake\u2019s\nresidence time. The residence time is the average length of time that any particular\nmolecule of water remains in the lake, and it is calculated by dividing the volume of\nwater in the lake by the rate at which water leaves the lake. The residence time is an\naverage; the time spent in the lake by a given molecule (if we could follow its fate) would\ndepend on the route it took: it might flow through as part of the fastest, most direct current,\n1\nor it might circle in a backwater for an indefinitely long time.\nResidence times vary enormously. They range from a few days for small lakes up to\nseveral hundred years for large ones; Lake Tahoe, in California, has a residence time of\n700 years. The residence times for the Great Lakes of North America, namely, Lakes\nSuperior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario, are, respectively, 190,100,22,2.5, and 6\nyears. Lake Erie\u2019s is the lowest: although its area is larger than Lake Ontario\u2019s, its volume\nislessthan one-third as great because it isso shallow-less than 20 meters on average.\nA given lake\u2019s residence time is by no means a fixed quantity. It depends on the rate\nat which water enters the lake, and that depends on the rainfall and the evaporation rate.\nClimatic change (the result of global warming?) is dramatically affecting the residence\ntimes of some lakes in northwestern Ontario, Canada. In the period 1970 to 1986, rainfall\nin the area decreased from 1,000 millimeters to 650 millimeters per annum, while\nabove-average temperatures speeded up the evapotranspiration rate (the rate at which\nwater is lost to the atmosphere through evaporation and the processes of plant life).\nThe result has been that the residence time of one of the lakes increased from 5 to\n18 years during the study period. The slowing down of water renewal leads to a chain of\nfurther consequences; it causes dissolved chemicals to become increasingly concentrated,\nand this, in turn, has a marked effect on all living things in the lake."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What are the different sources of water in a lake? \nHow does water leave a lake? \nHow is the volume of water entering and leaving a lake measured? \nWhat is a surface-water-dominated lake? \nWhat is a seepage-dominated lake? \nHow is the residence time of a lake calculated? \nWhy do residence times of lakes vary? \nHow is climatic change affecting the residence times of some lakes in northwestern Ontario, Canada? \nWhat are the consequences of slowing down water renewal in a lake?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "pls answer the following questions for me: 1.

This comprehensive guide delves into the essentials that will equip you to effortlessly explore the romance and allure of this floating city from a well-informed perspective.\n\nTo get the most out of your trip, start by investing time in selecting an appropriate travel guidebook. While Venice offers myriad delights, having a handy guide that offers well-researched advice, historical context, and off-the-beaten-path recommendations will undoubtedly enrich your understanding and appreciation of the city. Some popular choices include the Lonely Planet, Rick Steves, and DK Eyewitness Travel Guides.\n\nWhen it comes to packing, the key is to travel light while not compromising on the essentials. Regardless of the season, bring comfortable and versatile clothing that can be layered to adapt to Venice's fluctuating weather. Waterproof clothing and footwear are especially important, as the city is prone to the Acqua Alta, a phenomenon where water from the lagoon overflows into the streets.\n\nIn terms of electronic gadgets, a reliable power adapter with USB ports is an indispensable item. Keep in mind that Italy uses Type L and Type C plugs, so having a compatible adapter ensures you can charge your devices without hassle. Apart from this, a lightweight power bank for charging your mobile phone on the go can ease the stress of finding a charging point while out exploring.\n\nAs a tourist amidst the mystique of Venice, maps are crucial not only for navigation but also to gain a sense of the city's historical and artistic roots. Although Google Maps and other navigation apps are popular choices, consider downloading a map offline or purchasing a physical map, as certain areas within the city may suffer from weak internet connections.\n\nWhen walking the narrow streets and crossing countless bridges, a comfortable and sturdy pair of shoes becomes every traveler\u2019s best friend. Be sure to pack walking shoes that you've broken in prior to your trip, preferably waterproof, to avoid discomfort while wandering the cobbled alleys of Venice.\n\nAnother essential item in Venice is a Vaporetto pass, which provides unlimited access to public water buses that traverse the city's canals. For a fixed fee, visitors can choose from a 24-hour, 48-hour, or 72-hour pass, depending on their length of stay. This is a cost-effective choice compared to single-use Vaporetto tickets or private water taxi services.\n\nVenice is also famous for its vibrant festivals and events, such as Carnevale, the Venice Biennale, and the Venice Film Festival. Do some research before your visit and make a list of local events happening during your stay to participate in these cultural experiences.\n\nFinally, don't forget to carry a reusable water bottle, as Venice boasts numerous public drinking water fountains, called \"vernette.\" These fountains provide an eco-friendly and cost-effective way to stay hydrated and help reduce plastic waste in the city.\n\nIn conclusion, Venice is a city that promises a myriad of sensory experiences, and being prepared with the most beneficial items can help you make the most of this unforgettable journey.

This breathtaking city is known for its rich culture, history, and the unmissable experience of drifting through its canals on a gondola. If you are planning to visit Venice and wondering, \"Is it safe to visit Venice?\", this travel guide will provide a clear picture of the city's safety situation and tips for a hassle-free journey.\n\nOverall Safety in Venice\n\nIn general, Venice is considered a safe destination for travelers, with a relatively low crime rate compared to other major European cities. Tourists can feel secure while wandering through the charming streets, enjoying Venetian cuisine at local restaurants, and visiting popular attractions such as St. Mark's Basilica and the Doge's Palace.\n\nSafety and Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nWith the ongoing pandemic, it is crucial to stay informed about current health and safety protocols. The Italian government regularly updates travel advisories, and visitors should follow the guidelines provided by the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Masks are mandatory in crowded areas and on public transportation, and maintaining a physical distance from others is highly encouraged. Be sure to frequently wash or sanitize your hands and check the most recent information regarding entry requirements and quarantine regulations.\n\nPickpocketing and Petty Crime\n\nWhile Venice is generally safe for tourists, pickpocketing and petty theft can still occur, especially in crowded public areas such as Piazza San Marco and the Rialto Bridge. To minimize the risk and ensure personal security, visitors should remain vigilant and take precautions such as not displaying valuable items, keeping bags secured, and using a money belt. It's also a good idea to carry a photocopy of your passport rather than the original document to avoid any potential loss or theft.\n\nGetting Around Safely\n\nVenice's unique layout makes it a pedestrian paradise, but it's essential to pay attention to your surroundings while navigating the maze of narrow streets and bridges. Be cautious of uneven pavement, slippery surfaces near water, and low bridges that may require ducking to pass. During the high tourist season, streets can become incredibly crowded, so use common sense and don't hesitate to ask locals for directions if you are lost.\n\nFor a truly Venetian experience, taking a ride on a gondola or vaporetto (public water taxi) is highly recommended. These modes of transportation are safe and regulated, but it's wise to confirm the price with the gondolier or purchase a vaporetto ticket in advance to avoid tourist scams and overcharging.\n\nAqua Alta (High Water) and Flooding\n\nA natural phenomenon that Venice visitors may face is the Aqua Alta, where high tides cause flooding in the city. Though this occurrence may affect travel plans, it is generally not dangerous for tourists. Keep an eye on local weather forecasts and plan accordingly; Catwalks are usually set up in affected areas so that visitors can continue exploring the unique cityscape. Also, consider packing waterproof shoes to keep your feet dry.\n\nIn conclusion, Venice is a relatively safe city to visit, with a low risk of serious crime. By staying informed about current health and safety protocols, being vigilant about pickpocketing, and adhering to basic precautions while exploring this magical destination, tourists can enjoy an unforgettable Venetian adventure."}]}, {"facetValue": "provide detailed, humanlike tips for staying safe in Venice.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "provide detailed, humanlike tips for staying safe in Venice."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "provide advice on creating a travel safety guide for Venice."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a current and up to date information of a constructive guide for my Venice travel guide on \u201cTips for staying safe in Venice\" with humanlike style, non repetitive phrases and avoidance of unnatural sentences and randomness while explaining in details.

Venice is a generally safe destination for travelers, but taking extra precautions can ensure you have an enjoyable and secure experience. Here are some valuable tips for staying safe while exploring this beautiful and historic city.\n\nFirst and foremost, always be aware of your surroundings. Venice can become quite crowded, especially during high season, and the narrow streets and alleys can sometimes feel disorienting. Keep your personal belongings with you at all times and opt for an anti-theft bag or backpack to store your essential items like passports, money, and other valuables. This can help prevent pickpocketing and theft while in busy areas.\n\nIn addition, be mindful of scams that are sometimes targeted at tourists. This can include overpriced gondola rides, unlicensed tour guides, or people offering unsolicited help with your baggage. It's best to book your tours and activities through reputable sources and ask for official identification before following a tour guide. When taking a gondola ride, ensure you agree on the price and duration beforehand to avoid any misunderstandings.\n\nWhile navigating the city, pay attention to the signage and follow marked paths. Although getting lost in Venice's maze of alleys can be part of the charm, it's essential to have a sense of direction to avoid wandering into potentially unsafe areas. Keep a map or GPS on your phone to help navigate and plan your walks ahead of time. Familiarize yourself with landmarks like St. Mark's Basilica or Rialto Bridge, so you can easily find your way back to the main sites.\n\nVenice has various public transportation options, including vaporetto (water bus) and water taxis. Make sure to validate your ticket and board the correct vaporetto to avoid fines or becoming stranded. Additionally, do not lean over the edge of the vaporetto platform or allow children to do so, as this can be quite dangerous.\n\nDuring your stay, be mindful of your alcohol consumption. Venice is well known for its wine and lively nightlife. However, excessive alcohol can lead to making poor decisions or losing your sense of direction, which could put you in potentially unsafe situations. Drink responsibly and keep a clear mind while enjoying the city.\n\nVenice's infrastructure is at risk due to climate change and the increasing frequency of high tides (aqua alta). While visiting, stay informed about weather forecasts and flooding alerts. Follow local authorities' instructions if evacuation or temporary closures are announced.\n\nLastly, ensure you have appropriate insurance coverage and contact information for your embassy or consulate in case of emergency. Keep a list of important phone numbers handy, such as emergency services, your accommodation, and a taxi service.\n\nBy taking these precautions and staying vigilant during your trip, you'll be well-prepared to enjoy the splendor of Venice while ensuring your safety and security.

However, it is always essential to take appropriate measures and stay vigilant to ensure a trouble-free and enjoyable trip.\n\nNight Safety in Venice\n\nVenice, with its meandering canals, historic buildings, and picturesque bridges, continues to charm visitors even as evening falls. One may find that the city is even more magical at night, with the soft glow of lamplights reflecting on the ancient waterways. While crime rates are low, it is crucial to note that Venice is not immune to petty crimes like pickpocketing, purse snatching, and other tourist-targeted offenses. Fortunately, violent crimes are quite rare in the city.\n\nNavigating Venice after Dark\n\nThough Venice is fairly compact and walkable, the labyrinth of narrow streets, alleys, and bridges can be confusing, especially at night. To avoid getting lost, it is advised to carry a detailed map, have your phone's GPS handy, or download a reliable map application that can work offline. When exploring the city after dark, ensure that you make note of landmarks that can help in finding your way back. It is also a good idea to ask for directions from locals, as they are often friendly and helpful.\n\nSticking to Well-lit and Busy Areas\n\nWhile there's plenty to see and do in well-trodden tourist spots like Piazza San Marco, Rialto Bridge, and the Grand Canal, venturing into less crowded areas can also be appealing. However, it is safer to stick to brightly lit streets and avoid isolated areas at night. Always opt for routes that are occupied by other pedestrians as there is safety in numbers.\n\nTake Precautions with Valuables\n\nPetty crimes such as pickpocketing and bag snatching occur in busy tourist areas and public transport. Consider using a money belt or neck pouch to keep your valuables secure. Avoid displaying expensive items like smartphones, jewelry, or cameras in public. It is also wise to not carry large sums of cash and make copies of your important documents, like your passport, flight tickets, and credit cards, in case anything is lost or stolen.\n\nUsing Water & Land Taxis Safely\n\nIn contrast to the daytime hustle, Venice quiets down significantly at night. While the public vaporetto water buses operate round the clock, their frequency tends to decrease after midnight. Some vaporetto lines even stop running, which means you may need to rely on land taxis or private water taxis to get around. When using taxis, make sure they have the proper signage and that you agree on the fare beforehand to avoid being overcharged.\n\nSolo Travelers and Women's Safety\n\nFor solo travelers, Venice proves to be a safe city, even at night. Walking alone after dark is generally considered safe, but it is still essential to take the usual precautions. For women, it is always wise to dress modestly and avoid giving unwanted attention while staying aware of your surroundings.\n\nConclusion\n\nApart from the typical precautions that apply to any city, Venice is a safe destination for tourists, even at night.

Wandering the narrow streets, crossing the quaint bridges, and touring the grand buildings, the city has a unique charm that simply cannot be missed. However, as with any major tourist destination, Venice is not without its share of scams and hustles aimed at unsuspecting visitors. This constructive guide will help you identify and avoid falling prey to such schemes, ensuring you have a memorable and hassle-free Venetian adventure.\n\nScam Alert #1: The Helpful Local\n\nAs a visitor navigating the maze of canals and streets in Venice, you might find it easy to get lost. Scammers often take advantage of this situation by posing as helpful locals, offering to guide you to your desired location. In some instances, they might lead you to a secluded spot and then demand payment for their services. To avoid falling victim to this scam, rely on your map or GPS and kindly refuse unsolicited assistance.\n\nScam Alert #2: Beware the Pigeons in Piazza San Marco\n\nPiazza San Marco is a major tourist hotspot, and as such, attracts several individuals looking to make a quick buck from tourists. Among the most notorious scams in this area is the \"free\" birdseed offered to visitors for feeding the pigeons. Once you've accepted the seed and started feeding these birds, the person who provided it will demand payment for it, often at an exorbitant price. Politely refuse any offers for birdseed, and enjoy the square without contributing to the pigeon problem.\n\nScam Alert #3: Overpriced Restaurant Menus\n\nSome restaurants in Venice, particularly those around tourist hotspots, have been known to charge exorbitant prices to foreign patrons. These establishments will sometimes present a menu with reasonable prices, only to bring out a different, far more expensive bill at the end of the meal. Protect yourself from this scam by asking to see the menu again before paying and comparing it with the bill. Alternatively, dine in less touristy areas and look for eateries frequented by locals.\n\nScam Alert #4: The Gondola Ride Trick\n\nGondola rides are an iconic Venetian experience, but they can also be a hotspot for scams. Licensed gondoliers are required to display their pricing on their gondolas; however, some unscrupulous operators might overcharge tourists or charge for unscheduled \"extras\" during the ride. To avoid such surprises, confirm the gondola ride's price and duration before setting out and stick to the agreed-upon terms.\n\nScam Alert #5: Fake Glassware from Murano\n\nVenice is renowned for its beautiful Murano glass, which is made on the nearby island of Murano. However, not all glass products sold in Venice are genuine. Counterfeit versions imported from elsewhere are sold under the guise of being authentic Murano glass at reduced prices. If a product is suspiciously cheap, it is likely not the real deal. Purchase genuine Murano glass from craftsmen's workshops or reputable establishments.\n\nScam Alert #6: The Friendliest Taxi Drivers\n\nUnregulated water taxis are another source of scams in Venice. Some drivers will charge exorbitant fees or take unnecessary long routes to inflate the fare. To avoid being overcharged, ensure you take a licensed water taxi, identifiable by their yellow license strip, and request a fixed price before beginning your journey.\n\nBy being aware of these common scams and trusting your instincts when something seems too good to be true, you can navigate Venice with confidence and fully enjoy the majestic beauty of La Serenissima."}]}, {"facetValue": "provide a detailed, humanlike, and non-repetitive guide on what to do in case of an emergency while traveling in Venice.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "provide a detailed, humanlike, and non-repetitive guide on what to do in case of an emergency while traveling in Venice."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "provide advice on creating a travel guide section for handling emergencies while in Venice."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a current and up to date information of a constructive guide for my Venice travel guide on \u201cWhat to do if incase of emergency\" with humanlike style, non repetitive phrases and avoidance of unnatural sentences and randomness while explaining in details.

In Venice, some pharmacies are open 24/7 or have late-night services.\n\n4. Keep a safe distance from the water: Venice is prone to flooding, especially during the high tide season between October and March.

Some insurers may exclude certain conditions or require you to purchase additional coverage.\n\n5. Customer support and assistance: Travel protection insurance policies should offer 24/7 customer support, ensuring that help is only a call away.\n\nPurchasing Your Policy\n\nIt's essential to compare different travel protection insurance policies to find the best fit for your specific needs.

the model itself."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are some of the main takeaways from Dante\u2019s inferno?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. The concept of divine justice: One of the main takeaways from Dante's Inferno is the idea that there is a divine order and justice that governs the universe, and everyone will eventually face judgment for their deeds in life. The Inferno is filled with people suffering punishments that appropriately match their sins, demonstrating that no one escapes the consequences of their actions.\n\n2. The importance of moral choices: Throughout the Inferno, Dante encounters people who made moral choices during their lives, leading to their eternal torment in Hell. The poem serves as a reminder to make wise choices based on moral values and to avoid the pitfalls of engaging in sinful behavior.\n\n3. The power of human reason and divine guidance: Dante's journey through Hell is guided by the ancient Roman poet Virgil, who represents human reason, and Beatrice, who represents divine love and guidance. This journey highlights the value of reason and faith as tools to help navigate difficult situations and understand the order of the universe.\n\n4. The value of repentance and the potential for redemption: Despite the horrific punishments suffered by the souls in Hell, Dante's journey also reveals that repentance and redemption are possible for individuals who recognize their sins and seek forgiveness from God. This message of hope encourages reflection on one's actions and the effort to change for the better.\n\n5. The influence of politics and history: Dante's Inferno includes many contemporary political and historical figures, as well as mythological and literary characters, thus demonstrating that Dante's understanding of morality and justice was deeply connected to the events and issues of his time. This aspect of the poem reflects the importance of being aware of the societal and historical context that shapes our understanding of good and evil.\n\n6. The prominence of human emotions and desires: The souls in the Inferno experience intense emotional suffering that is often a direct reflection of their sinful desires and actions on Earth. Examples include the lustful who are blown around by violent winds, and the greedy who joust with enormous weights. These depictions highlight the potential destructive nature of unchecked emotions and desires.\n\n7. The allegorical nature of the journey: Dante's Inferno is an allegory for the individual's spiritual journey towards enlightenment, with the dark forest representing spiritual confusion, and the ascent of Mount Purgatory representing spiritual purification. This symbolic journey serves as a metaphor for the soul's exploration of morality, divine justice, and the search for personal growth and redemption."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are some major critiques of the book? "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Allegorical complexity: A major critique of Dante's Inferno is its complexity and the need for deep knowledge of various subjects, such as theology, history, classical literature, and Italian politics of the 14th century. Although this makes the text rich and layered, it may be challenging for modern readers to understand and appreciate the full meaning of the poem without extensive background knowledge.\n\n2. Dante's personal biases: It is well-known that Dante placed many of his political rivals and enemies in Hell, and throughout the poem, he often settles personal scores or promotes his own political beliefs. Critics argue that this can detract from the universality of the message about divine justice and make the poem seem like a platform for personal vendetta.\n\n3. Moral absolutism: Dante's Inferno operates within a fixed moral framework rooted in Christian theology, which may not resonate with contemporary readers holding different religious or moral beliefs. The poem implies an absolutist stance on morality and judgement, which can be limiting for a diverse audience.\n\n4. Depiction of women: Some modern critics argue that Dante's Inferno perpetuates the stereotypical representation of women, as they are mainly portrayed as either temptresses leading men to sin or as passive figures in need of male guidance. This portrayal may not fit contemporary ideas on gender equality and empowerment.\n\n5. The graphic nature of punishments: The detailed and vivid descriptions of the extreme punishments and suffering endured by the souls in Hell can be disturbing and gruesome. Some critics argue that the level of brutality depicted may distract from the poem's broader messages and make it challenging for sensitive readers.\n\n6. Dante's centrality: Dante presents himself as both the protagonist and the author of the poem, which can lead to accusations of self-aggrandizement and egoism. This narrative choice might also be seen as limiting the universal appeal of the poem as it strongly relies on Dante's personal experiences and reflections.\n\n7. Hierarchical view of the universe: Dante's moral and cosmological order is deeply hierarchical and fixed, with God at the top and sinners arranged in descending circles of Hell. While this aligns with the medieval Catholic worldview, it may be seen as outdated or limiting from a modern perspective that values pluralism and egalitarianism."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What chat bot version are you?

Unplanned or unexpected journey: Accidental travel stories revolve around characters who find themselves on journeys they did not plan or expect to undertake. They may be transported to another place, time, or world through mysterious or supernatural means, or they might stumble upon a hidden passage or portal that leads them to an uncharted destination.\n\n2. Adventure and discovery: The accidental travelers often face various challenges and obstacles during their journeys, including conflicts with antagonistic forces, unfamiliar customs, and difficult environments. Through these experiences, they often gain new skills, learn more about themselves, or uncover hidden talents they never knew they had.\n\n3. Elements of wonder and the unknown: Accidental travel stories often involve fantastical or supernatural elements, which lend an air of wonder, mystery, and excitement to the narrative. The travelers may encounter magical creatures, ancient artifacts, or alternate dimensions, and these extraordinary elements often help to drive the plot and keep readers engaged.\n\n4. Adaptation and growth: As the characters navigate their unexpected journey, they are often forced to adapt to new situations, learn new skills, and develop their personal abilities. The experience of accidental travel often serves as a catalyst for personal growth, pushing characters to examine their preconceived notions, values, and self-perceptions.\n\n5. The journey home: The ultimate goal of accidental travelers is often to find their way home, and they usually embark on a quest to do so. This can involve solving riddles or puzzles, completing tests, or simply surviving long enough to find a way back to the familiar world. Oftentimes, the characters return home changed, having learned valuable lessons or gained new perspectives through their travels.\n\n6. Themes of self-discovery and transformation: Accidental travel narratives tend to explore themes of self-discovery and transformation, with the protagonists learning more about themselves and growing as individuals throughout their journeys. By overcoming obstacles and navigating unfamiliar terrain, the characters can emerge stronger, wiser, and more self-aware.\n\n7. A blend of genres: Accidental travel stories often borrow elements from various literary genres, such as fantasy, science fiction, historical fiction, and adventure. This can result in rich, imaginative worlds and character-driven narratives that appeal to a wide range of readers.\n\n8. Externalization of inner journeys: Accidental travel can serve as a metaphor for personal growth and development, with characters' external journeys mirroring their inner journeys. The challenges they face and the lessons they learn in the course of their travels can reflect their emotional, psychological, or spiritual growth."}, {"role": "user", "content":

It argues that her dissatisfaction with traditional modes of women\u2019s characterization stems from their reliance on recognizable patriarchal models of personhood, an unhealthy dependence which restricts the development of new forms of gendered political and personal identification. This reading uses the concept of recognition, as understood in the post-Hegelian feminist tradition, as a key structuring and interpretative tool to demonstrate Woolf\u2019s early critical insight into the fraught relationship between idealized narratives of individual autonomy and gender. In doing so, it makes a case for the broader inclusion of recognition as a critical term of inquiry in modernist studies, both as an aesthetic and political site of contention.\n\n\nIntroduction\nVirginia Woolf\u2019s contemporaries often highlight characterization as a flaw in her writing practice. This common critical trope accompanies the publications of all her novels, starting with the very first, The Voyage Out (1915). An unsigned review in the Nation, for example, declares it \u201chardly a work of art. Partly because of its form, partly because it is too passionately intent upon vivisection.\u201d Despite offering generous praise for the execution of nearly every other aspect of the text, E. M. Forster finds that the \u201ccharacters are not vivid. [\u2009\u2026\u2009] they do not stroll out of their sentences, and even develop a tendency to merge shadow-like.\u201dWoolf\u2019s reactions to such comments were initially confined to her diaries and personal correspondence and ranged from frustration to acquiescence. Towards the end of the 1910s and early 1920s, however, they began to take a more distinct and public shape as a loose theory of modern fiction, developed in celebrated essays such as \u201cModern Novels\u201d (1919), \u201cReading\u201d (1919), \u201cMr Bennett and Mrs Brown\u201d (1923/4), and \u201cCharacter in Fiction\u201d (1924).Footnote3\n\nThe clamor of voices decrying the insufficiencies of modernist characters was a common feature in the critical landscape of the day, particularly when discussing novels of development and education, like The Voyage Out. As Jed Esty argues modernists often tried to circumvent the Bildungsroman\u2019s \u201cgeneric dictates or to revise them out of recognition.\u201dFootnote4 As a result, their modifications of the traditional developmental trajectories followed by its protagonists, associated with a process of learning and successful adaptation to social norms, tend to \u201cblock or defer the attainment of a mature social role.\u201dFootnote5 For Esty, Woolf\u2019s novel accomplishes just such an intervention through the workings of its plot and setting, which position its characters firmly within the histories of colonial contact, displacement, and migration.Footnote6 Susan Stanford Friedman also focuses on the text\u2019s challenges to the \u201corthodoxies of representation\u201d and its defiance of the \u201cboundaries of expectation as these have been erected by literary tradition.\u201dFootnote7 This reading concentrates explicitly on the function of women in the successful execution of the marriage plot and raises important questions about the role of gender in conventionally constructed narratives of development. The category of the \u201cfemale Bildungsroman,\u201d under which The Voyage Out was classified by early critics, has been in feminist critical parlance since at least the 1970s, chiefly occupying itself with investigating how women writers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries represented \u201cthe suppression and defeat of female autonomy, creativity, and maturity by patriarchal gender norms.\u201dFootnote8 In their well-known study in this tradition, Elizabeth Abel, Marianne Hirsch, and Elizabeth Langland, argue that the traditional Bildungsroman excludes gender \u201cas a pertinent category,\u201d an omission that has had direct effects on the dominant models for its \u201cnarrative structure,\u201d \u201cpsychology,\u201d and \u201crepresentation of social pressures.\u201dFootnote9 What is more, reading the history of the Bildungsroman as a document of the development of modern subjectivity, \u201cone could be tempted to conclude that the gender of modernity is indeed male,\u201d an impression, which, as Rita Felski states, calls for a sustained critique of the \u201cidealized representation of the autonomous male subject.\u201dFootnote10\n\nAs I will argue in what follows, Woolf\u2019s first novel engages in performing precisely this task and in doing so exhibits the development of a related interest in Woolf\u2019s thought. That is, the representation of women in fiction as a political problem, which is brought to bear on the aesthetic strategies of character construction and the hermeneutic practices employed to interpret them. Consequently, this article places emphasis on character, rather than plot formation, in order to bring to light Woolf\u2019s early insight into the regulatory power of reading norms. While the Bildungsroman plot in The Voyage Out allows Woolf to formulate a direct challenge to the narrative of development, as it relates to women\u2019s lives, her concerns go beyond a criticism of the limited social positions they are allowed to occupy.Footnote11 Directing her critical focus towards traditional models of characterization, heavily underwritten by the ideal of self-determination, shows that she identifies the very construction of the subject, in and through the normative conditions of power relations that shape our experiences as gendered and embodied agents, as a site of contention, anticipating much contemporary feminist theory on the topic. Furthermore, it lays the foundation of her critique of institutionalism and the forms of knowledge it engenders and propagates, which she elaborates more completely through her essays and novels of the 1920s and 1930s.

Brown in a recent essay, feminist approaches to Woolf\u2019s writing have been successful in instilling the importance of attending carefully to her \u201cgrowing conviction that existing institutions are structured by an ineradicably patriarchal logic, and therefore inadequate to the needs of women and to the requirements of a just society.\u201dFootnote12 Elucidating the ways in which Woolf sees this inadequacy as functioning through the narrative and hermeneutic norms which govern the literary representations of personhood, is the main objective of this article.\n\nTo begin this discussion, I would like to return to the term \u201crecognition,\u201d used in passing by Esty. Despite playing an important role within larger histories of ideas associated with personal autonomy and democratic social organization, the concept of recognition has been insufficiently developed in literary studies, as Felski has recently observed.Footnote13 Some consideration of recognition has taken place, mainly as a principle of poetics, derived from the Aristotelian notion of anagnorisis, which is generally understood to signify a moment of transition from ignorance to knowledge.Footnote14 These reflections have largely taken place within a framework of realist forms of representation, which tend to rely on a narrative logic of an inevitable revelation of purpose and meaning, a feature very much in operation within the Bildugnsroman, and one, which, as outlined above, the modernist novel of this kind tends to undermine. Hence, recognition in this sense, despite its customary operation as a principle of identity construction, has been deemed largely immaterial for modernist criticism in general, and feminist modernist criticism in particular. The larger political point encoded within the problem of recognition as an organizational device in fiction, which often evades detection, is brought into focus by Woolf\u2019s narrative of her young protagonist, Rachel Vinrace, who undertakes the task of becoming a socially recognizable individual within the context of a patriarchal economy of knowledge.Footnote15 The novel stages Rachel\u2019s engagement as the culmination of this educational process, the narrative and hermeneutic end of the literary imagination, followed by the young heroine\u2019s death. In a sense, this is the highest form anagnorisis can attain and its ultimate limitation \u2013 fiction constructed on this model, cannot see beyond that which is knowable, or even that which is known. As Ben Parker observes, it is at the point that the Aristotelian notion begins to acquire Hegelian echoes. \u201cThe logic of recognition,\u201d he writes, \u201cpresumes an ultimate knowability: the truth of subjectivity requires a detour though otherness,\u201d a detour obstructed under the conditions of capitalist modernity and the norms of identity development it espouses.Footnote16\n\nContemporary political theories of recognition also trace back to Hegel. His concept of Anerkennung as developed in the Phenomenology of Spirit (1807) is concerned with the constitution of knowing subjects, which he sees not as an isolated activity, but one which must be performed in communion with others: \u201c[s]elf-consciousness exists in and for itself when, and by the fact that, it so exists for another self-another; that is, it exists only in being acknowledged.\u201dFootnote17 This process upholds for Hegel the infinite nature of this two-fold exchange in dialectical opposition to the determinateness of self-consciousness. In other words, the subject has to be recognized by others and have its claims to personhood validated through intersubjective acknowledgement within the social sphere in order to escape the laws of its own determination. This also leads to establishing an autonomous sense of self and the creation of ethical obligations for the treatment of others. However, receiving and granting recognition under conditions of social inequality raises questions about the hierarchies of value generated by this exchange. Feminist philosophers continue to dispute the usefulness of recognition as a formative principle for democratic social structures, within which women can find emancipation. A significant voice in these debates is Judith Butler, whose concerns regarding the concept and its relationship to oppression are deep and persistent, as further discussion below will demonstrate. The benefits of reading Woolf in tandem with Butler have been brought into sharp focus by Elsa H\u00f6gberg, who examines the practice of recognition as an ethical counterpart to the problem of violence in the work of both authors. While H\u00f6gberg\u2019s study focuses on the interwar novels, from Jacob\u2019s Room (1922) to The Waves (1931), my analysis locates Woolf\u2019s interest in constructing new \u201caesthetic strategies for reconfiguring individuality\u201d at an even earlier moment, in her debut novel.Footnote18 It also explicitly takes up these strategies\u2019 gendered dimensions, focalized in The Voyage Out through Rachel\u2019s course of development towards acquiring a recognizable form of personhood in keeping with the limitations imposed by her social position as a young woman.\n\nStriving for recognition\nJudith Butler understands recognition as an essential aspect both of self-formation and interpersonal relations, part of a reciprocal communal exchange, for which \u201cwe are all, in different ways, striving.\u201dFootnote19 This is to say that recognition is a common human condition, a token of validation we require to affirm our existence as functioning agents within the social sphere. This fundamental reliance, for Butler, engenders certain dependencies which make us vulnerable to others as well as to the very norms that govern our relations with the wider world. In The Psychic Life of Power, she outlines this situation as one of \u201cprimary dependency [which] conditions the political formation and regulation of the subject and becomes the means of their subjection.\u201dFootnote20 The subject then is \u201cformed in submission\u201d to power \u201cthat at first appears as external, pressed upon the subject,\u201d but in \u201cpressing the subject into subordination, assumes a psychic form that constitutes the subject\u2019s self-identity.\u201dFootnote21 This relationship within which personhood is born, is one that \u201cinitiates and sustains our agency\u201d but also restricts and controls it.Footnote22 The concept of recognition, on this account, becomes implicated in practices of control, prevalent within the paradigmatic structure of power relations that shape the individual within a patriarchal context. Despite its subordinating power, however, recognition continues to be a necessary process due to our psychic and social need for it. In Butler\u2019s view, the subject in the process of self-formation either has to accept this form of subordinating relations or forgo participation in social life altogether. Both options prove undesirable, in different ways, harboring the illusion of a meaningful choice. The resistance strategy she offers is framed through a process of re-signification of the terms and practices individuals utilize to counter the prevalent logic of subjection such as forms of \u201ccritical desubjectivation\u201d and \u201cincoherence of identity.\u201dFootnote23\n\nWoolf\u2019s position, as it emerges in The Voyage Out itself and later essays carries more ambiguity. In the first instance, she situates recognition within the reading process, as a tool of characterization, and acknowledges its instrumental function for engendering a productive connection between writer, reader, and text. In \u201cCharacter in Fiction,\u201d she states that\n\n[t]he writer must get into touch with his reader by putting before him something which he recognises, which therefore stimulates his imagination, and makes him co-operate in the far more difficult business of intimacy. And it is of the highest importance that this common meeting-place should be reached easily, almost instinctively, in the dark, with one\u2019s eyes shut.Footnote24\n\nA shared experience emerges from this state of being in common with others. Establishing this intersubjective \u201cmeeting-place\u201d relies on a relationship of recognition between the reader and the forms of personhood they encounter in the text. When left to work in peace, the norms of judgement determine the types of fictional representation that can be recognized as characteristic of personhood. When they are meddled with, the entire socio-epistemological functioning of the reading process is endangered. The difficulty Woolf identifies for the writer is that the construction of a common space around a practice of recognition can constrain the emergence of new forms of identification, as well as the author\u2019s aesthetic field of experimentation. This complication, also formulated by Butler, arises through the demand to give an account of oneself, or to become legible, within the social sphere. In doing this, the subject is confronted with the exchange of their singularity for a measure of recognizability. \u201cIf I try to give an account of myself,\u201d she states:\nif I try to make myself recognizable and understandable [\u2009\u2026\u2009] I will, to some degree, have to make myself substitutable in order to make myself recognizable. The narrative authority of the \u201cI\u201d must give way to the perspective and temporality of a set of norms that contest the singularity of my own story.Footnote25\n\nIn The Voyage Out, Rachel comes to experience this demand directly on several occasions, usually when asked to introduce herself. During an outing, St John Hirst, one of her companions, proposes that each member of their party should provide \u201ca short biographical sketch.\u201dFootnote26 In response, Rachel states that she is \u201ctwenty-four years of age, the daughter of a ship-owner, that she had never been properly educated; played the piano, had no brothers or sisters, and lived at Richmond with her aunts, her mother being dead\u201d (159). This matter-of-fact description is only comparable in substance to the Who\u2019s Who compendium of short biographies of famous historical figures Rachel reads on board her father\u2019s ship, which takes her to the fictional colonial location of Santa Marina, where most of the novel\u2019s action takes place.Footnote27 She issues this string of facts, referring to her age, class, educational status, family history, and her sole occupation efficiently and impersonally, as if in fear or under duress, each comma marking yet another aspect of her social personhood. She presents herself as a common, not a singular being, one of many, her identity not porous, but impermeable, forged under the pressure of the unforgivable inevitability of norms.\nTerence Hewet, an aspiring novelist, and Rachel\u2019s future fianc\u00e9e, also challenges her to give an account of herself. At Terence\u2019s prompt, \u201cRachel,\u201d the narrator states, \u201clost her freedom and became self-conscious. She felt herself at once singular and under observation\u201d (245). For Felski, this would constitute a moment of recognition, which, unlike Butler, she sees as a potentially generative experience. When we engage in a process of recognition, she writes, \u201cwe make sense of what is unfamiliar by fitting it into an existing scheme, linking it to what we already know.\u201dFootnote28 But this initial connection with the norms we recognize does not have to produce an experience that is repetitive, derivative, or in any way subordinating. Instead, it could show us things in a new light, compelling us to imagine a \u201crevised or altered sense of who I am.\u201dFootnote29 On her reading, the self-conscious moment can simultaneously serve \u201cas a social diagnosis and an ethical judgement.\u201dFootnote30 As a result, she advocates preserving a certain epistemological openness, which harbors the potential to create new forms of self-knowledge that can be taken up by the subject through a phenomenological relation of \u201cself-scrutiny rather than self-loss.\u201dFootnote31\n\nThe startling experience of self-consciousness, provoked in Rachel by Terence\u2019s demand, however, is presented by Woolf as inimical to her freedom. Overwhelmed by the demands of recognition, the self-realization that she must become intelligible as a subject of norms threatens her capacity for generating self-knowledge. The realization that he sees her as a woman additionally inhibits Rachel\u2019s ability to communicate an individual position. Furthermore, she feels constrained and \u201champered,\u201d the necessity of self-scrutiny only revealing more loss of possibility (246\u20137). In this moment of self-consciousness Rachel comprehends her dependence on Terence and her own vulnerability, exposing Woolf\u2019s own critique of recognition predicated on the certainty of knowledge as model of emancipation. Instead, Rachel\u2019s freedom is diminished, she becomes an object of enquiry, of knowledge, and of desire, which can be mastered and acquired by others.Footnote32 Once she perceives her newly drawn outline produced through Terence\u2019s recognition of her womanhood, she is compelled to inhabit it by modifying or relinquishing other fragments of her identity. In this way, the norm prevails, forcing an act of dispossession.Footnote33 Louise DeSalvo draws attention to the differences between the first English edition of the novel and the first American one, published five years later, at this crucial moment in the development of the relationship between Rachel and Terence. The American edition, DeSalvo observes, offers a more combative Rachel, who refuses to be \u201cpinned down by any second person,\u201d which demonstrates Woolf\u2019s heightened attention to emphasizing the disbalance in the hermeneutic positions which Rachel and Terence occupy in this exchange.Footnote34 Rachel never demands a reciprocal account from Terence, allowing him the possibility to escape self-scrutiny and categorization. The novel purposefully refuses to represent this exchange between the two lovers as reciprocal and equal, a point which serves to complicate models of analysing ethical readings of recognition as \u201cdyadic encounters,\u201d which tend to equalize the power both agents hold in the validation of one another.Footnote35 In the context of a social infrastructure built upon networks of patriarchal power, Woolf seems to be suggesting, the position of women in this exercise, is one of deep disadvantage. In this sense, the common meeting place becomes less of a democratic locus for reinvention and more of a battleground for survival.\n\nBecoming a person\nEarly in the novel, Rachel is described as someone who is struggling to become a person. The prime impediments to this are associated with her ability to adequately employ her rational faculties, accumulate knowledge, and exercise command over her language. \u201cA hesitation in speaking,\u201d the narrator observes, \u201cor rather a tendency to use the wrong words, made her seem more than normally incompetent for her years\u201d (15\u201316). Further on we are told that \u201cher eyes were unreflecting as water\u201d and \u201cher mind was absent\u201d (17). As Allison Pease notes, this is not an unusual representation of womanhood in early twentieth-century literature. Rachel \u201chas failed the qualifications of post-Cartesian selfhood,\u201d she \u201cknows nothing; she thinks and feels, but she is an outsider to a system that produces knowing individuals.\u201dFootnote36 The inability to find the words to express her thoughts is a source of confusion both for Rachel herself and the people around her. Her preference for musical over literary forms of expression, reflective of her discomfort with explicit verbal identifications, is evident throughout the text. As a result, Rachel is seen as someone who is not possessed of the ability to generate rational certainty, making this one of the main issues in terms of her characterization. Emma Sutton connects this to her \u201cinarticulateness\u201d and the difficulties of expressing the intense richness of inner thought through the limited commands of spoken language.Footnote37 Molly Hite goes even further to suggest that in favoring \u201can inherently nonrepresentational\u201d art of expression for Rachel, Woolf curates \u201can aesthetic form that invents rather than represents.\u201dFootnote38 Music creates modalities of connection and identification that are non-structural and non-hierarchical, and allow Rachel to give full expression to the complexities of her interiority without having to negotiate the struggle for recognition.\n\nIn a novel, whose characters\u2019 chief occupation, as Eric Sandberg observes, is \u201cdefining, or characterizing, other people,\u201d Rachel\u2019s lack of clear outline presents a puzzle.Footnote39 In addition to failing the Cartesian principles of selfhood, rooted in rational self-examination, she seems to lack awareness of the gendered aspects of socialization. Mrs Helen Ambrose, her aunt, functions as a figure of female authority, whose role is to induct Rachel in traditional practices of womanhood, including those associated with motherhood and marriage. She takes it upon herself to \u201cenlighten\u201d (105) the young woman, whose sheltered upbringing by her two (unmarried) aunts, following the death of her mother, according to Helen, is the reason why she appears so removed from worldly interpersonal affairs, especially those associated with sexual desire. Rachel\u2019s encounter with Mr Dalloway on the ship to Santa Marina, provides a brief and unwelcome disclosure in this regard. During one of their brief conversations, he prompts: \u201c\u2018[\u2009\u2026\u2009] Now tell me about yourself. What are your interests and occupations?\u2019\u201d Rachel responds: \u201c\u2018You see, I\u2019m a woman\u2019\u201d (79).Footnote40 Her admission is met with an outburst of passion, which moves Mr Dalloway to assault her with a kiss, following which he misdirects responsibility for the violent act and accuses her of temptation. The direct second-person address, \u201c\u2018You tempt me,\u2019\u201d summons an act of individual agency Rachel is unable to account for (80). Her resulting feelings range from discomfort to fear, she is unable to sleep and stop thinking about the experience, feeling persecuted and entrapped. She confides in Helen, who simply explains that this is the way things are between men and women: \u201cit\u2019s the most natural thing in the world\u201d (86). This leads Rachel to formulate a link between herself and \u201cthose women in Piccadilly,\u201d who her aunt confirms are prostitutes (86). As Hite emphasizes, \u201cthe existence and meaning of the prostitute are of acute importance to a young girl entering the arena of sexual arrangements.\u201dFootnote41 The topic emerges again in a discussion with Evelyn Murgatroyd, another character in the novel, who is trying to navigate her marriage prospects, when it is explicitly linked to the economic foundations of marriage, understood as a \u201crelation of sexual ownership.\u201dFootnote42 The process of becoming a person recognizable by others for Rachel, as for Evelyn, and the rest of the women in the novel, is inevitably tied with negotiating the terms on which their bodies will be interpreted, valued, and possessed. The moment of confrontation with patriarchal sexuality leads Rachel to see \u201cher life for the first time [as] a creeping hedged-in thing, driven cautiously between high walls, here turned aside, there plunged in darkness, made dull and crippled forever\u201d (87). She suddenly starts to understand how gendered expectations restrict and direct behavior. This emerging sense of limitation foregrounds the conflict between the normative rituals associated with Rachel\u2019s \u201cculturally determined destiny\u201d as a wife and mother, as Christine Froula has argued, and her desire to \u201cbreak out of the female initiation plot that her culture imposes upon women, constituting them not as fully legitimated participants in history and culture.\u201dFootnote43 Woolf\u2019s concerns with this process of legitimation are linked to the institutional hierarchies that create disparities between those who can claim to be possessors of the means of knowledge production and those who can only acquire the resulting outcomes, a distinction which radically alters the balance of power in the practice of recognition.\n\nThe Voyage Out interrogates the role literature and practices of reading play in the establishments of these hierarchies, particularly as they relate to the education of women. As Friedman observes, \u201cthe reading of people\u201d and \u201cthe reading of books\u201d in the novel are often presented as binary opposites \u2013 the former related to the social sphere, and generally the domain of women and the latter, linked to the institutional production of knowledge, and thus reserved for men.Footnote44 The politics of reading was a topic that clearly occupied Woolf during the extended composition period of the novel, stretching from 1908 to 1913, during which she completed several essays on the topic.Footnote45 In the novel itself, Rachel receives instruction on her reading by various male characters, including Richard Dalloway, St John Hirst and her uncle, Ridley Ambrose. Mr Dalloway suggests Burke\u2019s writings on the American and French revolutions to induce a development of a political conscience. St John recommends Gibbon\u2019s multivolume history of the Roman empire as a way to test the viability of her mind. Mr Ambrose offers a course of learning based on the contents of his travel library that stretches from Balzac back to Marlowe.Footnote46 In his study, she is allowed to select her own reading and leaves with Le Cousine Bette (1846), a novel which displays women\u2019s insubordinate behavior as a persistent threat to the bourgeois stability of the family unit.\n\nAs the narrative develops, it is through the study and performance of literary characters that Rachel begins to take a more definite shape:\n\n\u201cWhat I want to know,\u201d she said aloud, \u201cis this: What is the truth? What is the truth of it all?\u201d She was speaking partly as herself and partly as the heroine of the play she had just read. [\u2009\u2026\u2009] for the moment she herself was the most vivid thing in it \u2013 a heroic statue in the middle of the foreground, dominating the view. Ibsen\u2019s plays always left her in that condition. She acted them for days at a time, greatly to Helen\u2019s amusement; and then it would be Meredith\u2019s turn and she became Diana of the Crossways, but Helen was aware that it was not all acting, and that some sort of change was taking place in the human being. (136\u20137)\n\nRachel\u2019s selection of texts focuses on the stories of modern women who inhabit a hostile world and commit various transgressive acts to free themselves from the confines associated with their gender identity.Footnote47 Her choices also reflect a forming idea of social inequality as Ibsen is followed \u201cby a novel such as Mrs Ambrose detested, whose purpose was to distribute the guilt of a woman\u2019s downfall upon the right shoulders\u201d (138). In addition to providing her with examples of womanhood, modern fiction also offers a space for experimentation with language. She reads the shiny, yellow-covered books \u201cwith the curious literalness of one to whom written sentences are unfamiliar, and handling words as though they were made of wood, separately of great importance, and possessed of shapes like tables and chairs\u201d (137\u20138). Rachel uses the language of literary representation to learn the normative shapes and sizes of modern human experience, and particularly that of women, aware that words carry the weight of the meanings ascribed to them. This experience of trying on fictional characters highlights the collaborative force with which language, norms, and forms come together to formulate the recognizable models of identification available to the modern reader.\nRachel\u2019s education and reading practice slowly create an archive of linguistic and behavioral codes to help her construct a picture of a coherent gendered personhood. As her performance within her social circle improves and reaches the expected standard, Mrs Ambrose directly gives her permission to be a person:\n\n\u201cSo now you can go ahead and be a person on your own account,\u201d she added. The vision of her own personality, of herself as a real everlasting thing, different from anything else, unmergeable, like the see or the wind, flashed in Rachel\u2019s mind, and she became profoundly excited at the thought of living. (90)\n\nRachel\u2019s jubilation at this prospect does not materialize in a conscious effort of making herself into a \u201creal everlasting thing\u201d; instead, she slides out of view at every chance of establishing herself, a practice encouraged by her eclectic reading. As Butler argues, the draw towards accounting for oneself as a singular subject, in search for social validation, is a crucial step in the practice of recognition, that inevitably comes to clash with the necessity to do so within a normative framework of social relations. Any such account will have to involve parts that do not belong to the subject, whether because they are linked with the norms that direct her own self-constitution or the norms that guide her expression and intelligibility. In this respect, Butler asserts, \u201cit is only in dispossession that I can and do give an account of myself.\u201dFootnote48 Having \u201clearned something about the social limits to her possibilities,\u201d in Hite\u2019s formulation, Rachel is shown to realize the constrained scope of agential action, determined by the gender norms associated with her self-development, within which she is allowed to operate.Footnote49 The novel also adapts to this disruption of the recognition arc and its \u201crepresentational strategies\u201d and begins to \u201cdefine her body more and more in terms of an observer\u2019s gaze,\u201d manifesting its awareness that \u201cthe knowledge of and entrance into the public realm involve endangering other kinds of knowledge and other realms of ontological contact.\u201dFootnote50\nEntering the public sphere\nFollowing her experience of self-consciousness triggered by the confrontation with Terence\u2019s demand, Rachel perceives that the shapes she can inhabit that can generate recognition in response are always already there, carved out of normative demands. The implied function of recognition as a regulation principle, which determines the forms of identity that can be legitimately adopted within the wider normative order, is exposed during the Sunday church service. Rachel looks at the faces she knows from luncheons, walks, and card games and for the first time regards them as fabricated. This realization triggers a process of Cartesian revelation, which makes her reject \u201call that she had implicitly believed\u201d (265). She is unsettled by her fellow travelers\u2019 need for validation, which makes them into \u201cslavishly acquiescent [\u2009\u2026\u2009] limpet[s],\u201d who allow themselves to be co-opted within a deeply suspect economy of exchange (265). Rachel\u2019s internal monologue shows her becoming critically aware of the norms of legibility which govern the social order in which she is expected to enlist. This is the closest the novel comes to articulating a scene of recognition in the traditional sense and it is significant that Rachel\u2019s transition from a position of relative inexperience to one of \u201cenlightenment\u201d occurs not as an act of self-reflection, but as one of public reading. In her previous encounters with the male characters who demand an account of herself, she has been evasive, impersonal, but never fully open or entirely paradigmatic as a participant in the economy of desire. Instinctively aware of the threat recognition carries for her own singularity, she is not prepared to be transparent to others, her presence in interpersonal exchanges being marked by a curious elusiveness and withholding of substance. Woolf\u2019s own elusiveness in terms of offering \u201cauthorial guidance\u201d functions not only through the presentation of \u201cconflicting tonal cues\u201d in relation to the reading of characters, but through her deliberate refusal to structure her narrative around the recognition coordinates expected of it.Footnote51 In this way, she also expands her critical examination from its initial focus on the normative links that are used to construct the novel as a form primary concerned with the representation of personhood, into the \u201cpolitical stakes of the specific work of literary production.\u201dFootnote52\n\nWoolf\u2019s skeptical attitude towards the function of the literary establishment, which to a large extent determines the relationship between texts, authors, and readers, forms an important part of her larger institutional critique. She is particularly disparaging in her evaluation of the British reading public\u2019s attachment to norms, expectations, and habitual practices. She declares it \u201ca very suggestible and docile creature,\u201d which often persists in supporting commonly held notions. In her view, the public generally wants books to confirm their own view of the world, without much defiance:\n\n[o]ld women have houses. They have fathers. They have incomes. They have hot-water bottles. This is how we know that they are old women. Mr Wells and Mr Bennett and Mr Galsworthy have always taught us that this is the way to recognise them.Footnote53\n\nA relationship of this kind conducted on the basis of supply and demand principles, for Woolf, \u201cceases to be a means of communication between writer and reader, and becomes instead an obstacle and an impediment.\u201dFootnote54 This misconception of the novel\u2019s function underscores its implied cooperation with the maintenance of established social standards in the context of patriarchal capitalist modernity. As Victoria Baena argues, through a reading of Walter Benjamin\u2019s 1934 essay \u201cThe Author as a Producer,\u201d the \u201crole of the intellectual\u201d should be understood \u201cless in terms of political \u2018commitment\u2019 than as the writer of works that change or at least challenge the world\u201d \u2013 an apt description of Woolf\u2019s statement of intent in her debut novel and a lens through which to read her subsequent experiments with literary work in all its guises, as a form of feminist social criticism.Footnote55\nAfter the church scene, Rachel begins to fade away from the narrative. Her status as a protagonist is repeatedly disrupted and diminished instead of asserted and expanded; until, finally, her death is reduced to a conversation topic after tea. Even when she accepts Terence\u2019s offer of marriage during their visit to an Indigenous village, she is not really a person with a mind of her own, and only echoes the sentiments he offers her, adhering to social protocol.\n\n\u201cYou like being with me?\u201d Terence asked. \u201cYes, with you,\u201d she replied. [\u2009\u2026\u2009] \u201cWe are happy together.\u201d He did not seem to be speaking, or she to be hearing. \u201cVery happy,\u201d she answered. [\u2009\u2026\u2009] \u201cWe love each other,\u201d Terence said. \u201cWe love each other,\u201d she repeated. (316)\n\nRachel\u2019s position in the novel becomes further obscured as other characters start relating to her as Terence\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, following the announcement of the engagement. Their previous caution towards her is quickly overcome by her identification as a social presence they can recognize. While returning \u201cThank You\u201d notes she thinks it strange that \u201cconsidering how very different these people were, [\u2009\u2026\u2009] they used almost the same sentences when they wrote to congratulate her upon her engagement\u201d (342). Shortly after this, Rachel\u2019s fever overcomes her and she slips out of consciousness.Footnote56 This is the final act of dispossession the novel performs. The form of personhood available to her as a married woman obstructs all other possible accounts she might have wished to draw for herself. Even though Rachel agrees to become Terence\u2019s wife, the norms which govern this decision are not hers to make but are hers to comply with. As Butler asserts,\none invariably struggles with conditions of one\u2019s own life that one could not have chosen. If there is an operation of agency or, indeed, freedom in this struggle, it takes place in the context of an enabling and limiting field of constraint.\n\nBy allowing Rachel to break out of the characterization model allocated for women in the Bildungsroman, Woolf undermines the exercise of choice as an expression of agency, and with that the entire foundation on which the \u201cidealized representation of [the] autonomous male subject\u201d rests.Footnote58 Rachel\u2019s disrupted narrative shows that under conditions of patriarchal oppression, the self-determination narrative, mapped out across various points of recognition, becomes another form of control.\nConclusion\nIn theoretical terms, literary character has almost exclusively been discussed as a universal concept, nearly an ideal, akin to that of the autonomous Kantian subject, and in many ways designed to replicate it. Its failures and successes are decided by the same measure. It is often encumbered by expectations of accuracy, truthfulness, and relatability, which all combine to curate a reading process organized around the principle of recognition, both as an aesthetic and political construct. Woolf, however, saw this as a rather restrictive convention and made her opposition to it the cornerstone of her critical engagement with modern fiction. One of the reasons she questioned recognition-based principles for the construction and reading of fiction was connected to a concern about the potential of this convention to narrow the field of authorial invention and thus obscure the novel\u2019s ability to respond to changing social realities. Another, was a more broadly political one, connected to the representation of women in fiction. Woolf worried that a recognition-based model for the construction of personhood, can be used to support a binary world of power and gender relations, where norms are used to control the formation and expressions of identity and the ways in which they can be legitimized. Woolf\u2019s interest in this project, initiated in her first novel and continued throughout her writing life, is not confined to simply decoding the restrictive and implicit dangers of relying on such models in fiction as well as in life. Her first novel begins the work of proposing a new code of practice that would support more diverse forms of personhood and engender the formation of novel and emancipatory forms of political life. In this project the purpose of the novelist appears to be nothing short of imagining personhood anew, of learning to re-cognize it, and deliver it from the confines of its traditional forms.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The writing style and tone found in these paragraphs are academic, dense, and analytical.

It argues that her dissatisfaction with traditional modes of women\u2019s characterization stems from their reliance on recognizable patriarchal models of personhood, an unhealthy dependence which restricts the development of new forms of gendered political and personal identification. This reading uses the concept of recognition, as understood in the post-Hegelian feminist tradition, as a key structuring and interpretative tool to demonstrate Woolf\u2019s early critical insight into the fraught relationship between idealized narratives of individual autonomy and gender. In doing so, it makes a case for the broader inclusion of recognition as a critical term of inquiry in modernist studies, both as an aesthetic and political site of contention.\n\n\nIntroduction\nVirginia Woolf\u2019s contemporaries often highlight characterization as a flaw in her writing practice. This common critical trope accompanies the publications of all her novels, starting with the very first, The Voyage Out (1915). An unsigned review in the Nation, for example, declares it \u201chardly a work of art. Partly because of its form, partly because it is too passionately intent upon vivisection.\u201d Despite offering generous praise for the execution of nearly every other aspect of the text, E. M. Forster finds that the \u201ccharacters are not vivid. [\u2009\u2026\u2009] they do not stroll out of their sentences, and even develop a tendency to merge shadow-like.\u201dWoolf\u2019s reactions to such comments were initially confined to her diaries and personal correspondence and ranged from frustration to acquiescence. Towards the end of the 1910s and early 1920s, however, they began to take a more distinct and public shape as a loose theory of modern fiction, developed in celebrated essays such as \u201cModern Novels\u201d (1919), \u201cReading\u201d (1919), \u201cMr Bennett and Mrs Brown\u201d (1923/4), and \u201cCharacter in Fiction\u201d (1924).Footnote3\n\nThe clamor of voices decrying the insufficiencies of modernist characters was a common feature in the critical landscape of the day, particularly when discussing novels of development and education, like The Voyage Out. As Jed Esty argues modernists often tried to circumvent the Bildungsroman\u2019s \u201cgeneric dictates or to revise them out of recognition.\u201dFootnote4 As a result, their modifications of the traditional developmental trajectories followed by its protagonists, associated with a process of learning and successful adaptation to social norms, tend to \u201cblock or defer the attainment of a mature social role.\u201dFootnote5 For Esty, Woolf\u2019s novel accomplishes just such an intervention through the workings of its plot and setting, which position its characters firmly within the histories of colonial contact, displacement, and migration.Footnote6 Susan Stanford Friedman also focuses on the text\u2019s challenges to the \u201corthodoxies of representation\u201d and its defiance of the \u201cboundaries of expectation as these have been erected by literary tradition.\u201dFootnote7 This reading concentrates explicitly on the function of women in the successful execution of the marriage plot and raises important questions about the role of gender in conventionally constructed narratives of development. The category of the \u201cfemale Bildungsroman,\u201d under which The Voyage Out was classified by early critics, has been in feminist critical parlance since at least the 1970s, chiefly occupying itself with investigating how women writers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries represented \u201cthe suppression and defeat of female autonomy, creativity, and maturity by patriarchal gender norms.\u201dFootnote8 In their well-known study in this tradition, Elizabeth Abel, Marianne Hirsch, and Elizabeth Langland, argue that the traditional Bildungsroman excludes gender \u201cas a pertinent category,\u201d an omission that has had direct effects on the dominant models for its \u201cnarrative structure,\u201d \u201cpsychology,\u201d and \u201crepresentation of social pressures.\u201dFootnote9 What is more, reading the history of the Bildungsroman as a document of the development of modern subjectivity, \u201cone could be tempted to conclude that the gender of modernity is indeed male,\u201d an impression, which, as Rita Felski states, calls for a sustained critique of the \u201cidealized representation of the autonomous male subject.\u201dFootnote10\n\nAs I will argue in what follows, Woolf\u2019s first novel engages in performing precisely this task and in doing so exhibits the development of a related interest in Woolf\u2019s thought. That is, the representation of women in fiction as a political problem, which is brought to bear on the aesthetic strategies of character construction and the hermeneutic practices employed to interpret them. Consequently, this article places emphasis on character, rather than plot formation, in order to bring to light Woolf\u2019s early insight into the regulatory power of reading norms. While the Bildungsroman plot in The Voyage Out allows Woolf to formulate a direct challenge to the narrative of development, as it relates to women\u2019s lives, her concerns go beyond a criticism of the limited social positions they are allowed to occupy.Footnote11 Directing her critical focus towards traditional models of characterization, heavily underwritten by the ideal of self-determination, shows that she identifies the very construction of the subject, in and through the normative conditions of power relations that shape our experiences as gendered and embodied agents, as a site of contention, anticipating much contemporary feminist theory on the topic. Furthermore, it lays the foundation of her critique of institutionalism and the forms of knowledge it engenders and propagates, which she elaborates more completely through her essays and novels of the 1920s and 1930s. As stated by Stephanie J. Brown in a recent essay, feminist approaches to Woolf\u2019s writing have been successful in instilling the importance of attending carefully to her \u201cgrowing conviction that existing institutions are structured by an ineradicably patriarchal logic, and therefore inadequate to the needs of women and to the requirements of a just society.\u201dFootnote12 Elucidating the ways in which Woolf sees this inadequacy as functioning through the narrative and hermeneutic norms which govern the literary representations of personhood, is the main objective of this article.\n\nTo begin this discussion, I would like to return to the term \u201crecognition,\u201d used in passing by Esty. Despite playing an important role within larger histories of ideas associated with personal autonomy and democratic social organization, the concept of recognition has been insufficiently developed in literary studies, as Felski has recently observed.Footnote13 Some consideration of recognition has taken place, mainly as a principle of poetics, derived from the Aristotelian notion of anagnorisis, which is generally understood to signify a moment of transition from ignorance to knowledge.Footnote14 These reflections have largely taken place within a framework of realist forms of representation, which tend to rely on a narrative logic of an inevitable revelation of purpose and meaning, a feature very much in operation within the Bildugnsroman, and one, which, as outlined above, the modernist novel of this kind tends to undermine. Hence, recognition in this sense, despite its customary operation as a principle of identity construction, has been deemed largely immaterial for modernist criticism in general, and feminist modernist criticism in particular. The larger political point encoded within the problem of recognition as an organizational device in fiction, which often evades detection, is brought into focus by Woolf\u2019s narrative of her young protagonist, Rachel Vinrace, who undertakes the task of becoming a socially recognizable individual within the context of a patriarchal economy of knowledge.Footnote15 The novel stages Rachel\u2019s engagement as the culmination of this educational process, the narrative and hermeneutic end of the literary imagination, followed by the young heroine\u2019s death. In a sense, this is the highest form anagnorisis can attain and its ultimate limitation \u2013 fiction constructed on this model, cannot see beyond that which is knowable, or even that which is known. As Ben Parker observes, it is at the point that the Aristotelian notion begins to acquire Hegelian echoes. \u201cThe logic of recognition,\u201d he writes, \u201cpresumes an ultimate knowability: the truth of subjectivity requires a detour though otherness,\u201d a detour obstructed under the conditions of capitalist modernity and the norms of identity development it espouses.Footnote16\n\nContemporary political theories of recognition also trace back to Hegel. His concept of Anerkennung as developed in the Phenomenology of Spirit (1807) is concerned with the constitution of knowing subjects, which he sees not as an isolated activity, but one which must be performed in communion with others: \u201c[s]elf-consciousness exists in and for itself when, and by the fact that, it so exists for another self-another; that is, it exists only in being acknowledged.\u201dFootnote17 This process upholds for Hegel the infinite nature of this two-fold exchange in dialectical opposition to the determinateness of self-consciousness. In other words, the subject has to be recognized by others and have its claims to personhood validated through intersubjective acknowledgement within the social sphere in order to escape the laws of its own determination. This also leads to establishing an autonomous sense of self and the creation of ethical obligations for the treatment of others. However, receiving and granting recognition under conditions of social inequality raises questions about the hierarchies of value generated by this exchange. Feminist philosophers continue to dispute the usefulness of recognition as a formative principle for democratic social structures, within which women can find emancipation. A significant voice in these debates is Judith Butler, whose concerns regarding the concept and its relationship to oppression are deep and persistent, as further discussion below will demonstrate. The benefits of reading Woolf in tandem with Butler have been brought into sharp focus by Elsa H\u00f6gberg, who examines the practice of recognition as an ethical counterpart to the problem of violence in the work of both authors. While H\u00f6gberg\u2019s study focuses on the interwar novels, from Jacob\u2019s Room (1922) to The Waves (1931), my analysis locates Woolf\u2019s interest in constructing new \u201caesthetic strategies for reconfiguring individuality\u201d at an even earlier moment, in her debut novel.Footnote18 It also explicitly takes up these strategies\u2019 gendered dimensions, focalized in The Voyage Out through Rachel\u2019s course of development towards acquiring a recognizable form of personhood in keeping with the limitations imposed by her social position as a young woman.\n\nStriving for recognition\nJudith Butler understands recognition as an essential aspect both of self-formation and interpersonal relations, part of a reciprocal communal exchange, for which \u201cwe are all, in different ways, striving.\u201dFootnote19 This is to say that recognition is a common human condition, a token of validation we require to affirm our existence as functioning agents within the social sphere. This fundamental reliance, for Butler, engenders certain dependencies which make us vulnerable to others as well as to the very norms that govern our relations with the wider world. In The Psychic Life of Power, she outlines this situation as one of \u201cprimary dependency [which] conditions the political formation and regulation of the subject and becomes the means of their subjection.\u201dFootnote20 The subject then is \u201cformed in submission\u201d to power \u201cthat at first appears as external, pressed upon the subject,\u201d but in \u201cpressing the subject into subordination, assumes a psychic form that constitutes the subject\u2019s self-identity.\u201dFootnote21 This relationship within which personhood is born, is one that \u201cinitiates and sustains our agency\u201d but also restricts and controls it.Footnote22 The concept of recognition, on this account, becomes implicated in practices of control, prevalent within the paradigmatic structure of power relations that shape the individual within a patriarchal context. Despite its subordinating power, however, recognition continues to be a necessary process due to our psychic and social need for it. In Butler\u2019s view, the subject in the process of self-formation either has to accept this form of subordinating relations or forgo participation in social life altogether. Both options prove undesirable, in different ways, harboring the illusion of a meaningful choice. The resistance strategy she offers is framed through a process of re-signification of the terms and practices individuals utilize to counter the prevalent logic of subjection such as forms of \u201ccritical desubjectivation\u201d and \u201cincoherence of identity.\u201dFootnote23\n\nWoolf\u2019s position, as it emerges in The Voyage Out itself and later essays carries more ambiguity. In the first instance, she situates recognition within the reading process, as a tool of characterization, and acknowledges its instrumental function for engendering a productive connection between writer, reader, and text. In \u201cCharacter in Fiction,\u201d she states that\n\n[t]he writer must get into touch with his reader by putting before him something which he recognises, which therefore stimulates his imagination, and makes him co-operate in the far more difficult business of intimacy. And it is of the highest importance that this common meeting-place should be reached easily, almost instinctively, in the dark, with one\u2019s eyes shut.Footnote24\n\nA shared experience emerges from this state of being in common with others. Establishing this intersubjective \u201cmeeting-place\u201d relies on a relationship of recognition between the reader and the forms of personhood they encounter in the text. When left to work in peace, the norms of judgement determine the types of fictional representation that can be recognized as characteristic of personhood. When they are meddled with, the entire socio-epistemological functioning of the reading process is endangered. The difficulty Woolf identifies for the writer is that the construction of a common space around a practice of recognition can constrain the emergence of new forms of identification, as well as the author\u2019s aesthetic field of experimentation. This complication, also formulated by Butler, arises through the demand to give an account of oneself, or to become legible, within the social sphere. In doing this, the subject is confronted with the exchange of their singularity for a measure of recognizability. \u201cIf I try to give an account of myself,\u201d she states:\nif I try to make myself recognizable and understandable [\u2009\u2026\u2009] I will, to some degree, have to make myself substitutable in order to make myself recognizable. The narrative authority of the \u201cI\u201d must give way to the perspective and temporality of a set of norms that contest the singularity of my own story.Footnote25\n\nIn The Voyage Out, Rachel comes to experience this demand directly on several occasions, usually when asked to introduce herself. During an outing, St John Hirst, one of her companions, proposes that each member of their party should provide \u201ca short biographical sketch.\u201dFootnote26 In response, Rachel states that she is \u201ctwenty-four years of age, the daughter of a ship-owner, that she had never been properly educated; played the piano, had no brothers or sisters, and lived at Richmond with her aunts, her mother being dead\u201d (159). This matter-of-fact description is only comparable in substance to the Who\u2019s Who compendium of short biographies of famous historical figures Rachel reads on board her father\u2019s ship, which takes her to the fictional colonial location of Santa Marina, where most of the novel\u2019s action takes place.Footnote27 She issues this string of facts, referring to her age, class, educational status, family history, and her sole occupation efficiently and impersonally, as if in fear or under duress, each comma marking yet another aspect of her social personhood. She presents herself as a common, not a singular being, one of many, her identity not porous, but impermeable, forged under the pressure of the unforgivable inevitability of norms.\nTerence Hewet, an aspiring novelist, and Rachel\u2019s future fianc\u00e9e, also challenges her to give an account of herself. At Terence\u2019s prompt, \u201cRachel,\u201d the narrator states, \u201clost her freedom and became self-conscious. She felt herself at once singular and under observation\u201d (245). For Felski, this would constitute a moment of recognition, which, unlike Butler, she sees as a potentially generative experience. When we engage in a process of recognition, she writes, \u201cwe make sense of what is unfamiliar by fitting it into an existing scheme, linking it to what we already know.\u201dFootnote28 But this initial connection with the norms we recognize does not have to produce an experience that is repetitive, derivative, or in any way subordinating. Instead, it could show us things in a new light, compelling us to imagine a \u201crevised or altered sense of who I am.\u201dFootnote29 On her reading, the self-conscious moment can simultaneously serve \u201cas a social diagnosis and an ethical judgement.\u201dFootnote30 As a result, she advocates preserving a certain epistemological openness, which harbors the potential to create new forms of self-knowledge that can be taken up by the subject through a phenomenological relation of \u201cself-scrutiny rather than self-loss.\u201dFootnote31\n\nThe startling experience of self-consciousness, provoked in Rachel by Terence\u2019s demand, however, is presented by Woolf as inimical to her freedom. Overwhelmed by the demands of recognition, the self-realization that she must become intelligible as a subject of norms threatens her capacity for generating self-knowledge. The realization that he sees her as a woman additionally inhibits Rachel\u2019s ability to communicate an individual position. Furthermore, she feels constrained and \u201champered,\u201d the necessity of self-scrutiny only revealing more loss of possibility (246\u20137). In this moment of self-consciousness Rachel comprehends her dependence on Terence and her own vulnerability, exposing Woolf\u2019s own critique of recognition predicated on the certainty of knowledge as model of emancipation. Instead, Rachel\u2019s freedom is diminished, she becomes an object of enquiry, of knowledge, and of desire, which can be mastered and acquired by others.Footnote32 Once she perceives her newly drawn outline produced through Terence\u2019s recognition of her womanhood, she is compelled to inhabit it by modifying or relinquishing other fragments of her identity. In this way, the norm prevails, forcing an act of dispossession.Footnote33 Louise DeSalvo draws attention to the differences between the first English edition of the novel and the first American one, published five years later, at this crucial moment in the development of the relationship between Rachel and Terence. The American edition, DeSalvo observes, offers a more combative Rachel, who refuses to be \u201cpinned down by any second person,\u201d which demonstrates Woolf\u2019s heightened attention to emphasizing the disbalance in the hermeneutic positions which Rachel and Terence occupy in this exchange.Footnote34 Rachel never demands a reciprocal account from Terence, allowing him the possibility to escape self-scrutiny and categorization. The novel purposefully refuses to represent this exchange between the two lovers as reciprocal and equal, a point which serves to complicate models of analysing ethical readings of recognition as \u201cdyadic encounters,\u201d which tend to equalize the power both agents hold in the validation of one another.Footnote35 In the context of a social infrastructure built upon networks of patriarchal power, Woolf seems to be suggesting, the position of women in this exercise, is one of deep disadvantage. In this sense, the common meeting place becomes less of a democratic locus for reinvention and more of a battleground for survival.\n\nBecoming a person\nEarly in the novel, Rachel is described as someone who is struggling to become a person. The prime impediments to this are associated with her ability to adequately employ her rational faculties, accumulate knowledge, and exercise command over her language. \u201cA hesitation in speaking,\u201d the narrator observes, \u201cor rather a tendency to use the wrong words, made her seem more than normally incompetent for her years\u201d (15\u201316). Further on we are told that \u201cher eyes were unreflecting as water\u201d and \u201cher mind was absent\u201d (17). As Allison Pease notes, this is not an unusual representation of womanhood in early twentieth-century literature. Rachel \u201chas failed the qualifications of post-Cartesian selfhood,\u201d she \u201cknows nothing; she thinks and feels, but she is an outsider to a system that produces knowing individuals.\u201dFootnote36 The inability to find the words to express her thoughts is a source of confusion both for Rachel herself and the people around her. Her preference for musical over literary forms of expression, reflective of her discomfort with explicit verbal identifications, is evident throughout the text. As a result, Rachel is seen as someone who is not possessed of the ability to generate rational certainty, making this one of the main issues in terms of her characterization. Emma Sutton connects this to her \u201cinarticulateness\u201d and the difficulties of expressing the intense richness of inner thought through the limited commands of spoken language.Footnote37 Molly Hite goes even further to suggest that in favoring \u201can inherently nonrepresentational\u201d art of expression for Rachel, Woolf curates \u201can aesthetic form that invents rather than represents.\u201dFootnote38 Music creates modalities of connection and identification that are non-structural and non-hierarchical, and allow Rachel to give full expression to the complexities of her interiority without having to negotiate the struggle for recognition.\n\nIn a novel, whose characters\u2019 chief occupation, as Eric Sandberg observes, is \u201cdefining, or characterizing, other people,\u201d Rachel\u2019s lack of clear outline presents a puzzle.Footnote39 In addition to failing the Cartesian principles of selfhood, rooted in rational self-examination, she seems to lack awareness of the gendered aspects of socialization. Mrs Helen Ambrose, her aunt, functions as a figure of female authority, whose role is to induct Rachel in traditional practices of womanhood, including those associated with motherhood and marriage. She takes it upon herself to \u201cenlighten\u201d (105) the young woman, whose sheltered upbringing by her two (unmarried) aunts, following the death of her mother, according to Helen, is the reason why she appears so removed from worldly interpersonal affairs, especially those associated with sexual desire. Rachel\u2019s encounter with Mr Dalloway on the ship to Santa Marina, provides a brief and unwelcome disclosure in this regard. During one of their brief conversations, he prompts: \u201c\u2018[\u2009\u2026\u2009] Now tell me about yourself. What are your interests and occupations?\u2019\u201d Rachel responds: \u201c\u2018You see, I\u2019m a woman\u2019\u201d (79).Footnote40 Her admission is met with an outburst of passion, which moves Mr Dalloway to assault her with a kiss, following which he misdirects responsibility for the violent act and accuses her of temptation. The direct second-person address, \u201c\u2018You tempt me,\u2019\u201d summons an act of individual agency Rachel is unable to account for (80). Her resulting feelings range from discomfort to fear, she is unable to sleep and stop thinking about the experience, feeling persecuted and entrapped. She confides in Helen, who simply explains that this is the way things are between men and women: \u201cit\u2019s the most natural thing in the world\u201d (86). This leads Rachel to formulate a link between herself and \u201cthose women in Piccadilly,\u201d who her aunt confirms are prostitutes (86). As Hite emphasizes, \u201cthe existence and meaning of the prostitute are of acute importance to a young girl entering the arena of sexual arrangements.\u201dFootnote41 The topic emerges again in a discussion with Evelyn Murgatroyd, another character in the novel, who is trying to navigate her marriage prospects, when it is explicitly linked to the economic foundations of marriage, understood as a \u201crelation of sexual ownership.\u201dFootnote42 The process of becoming a person recognizable by others for Rachel, as for Evelyn, and the rest of the women in the novel, is inevitably tied with negotiating the terms on which their bodies will be interpreted, valued, and possessed. The moment of confrontation with patriarchal sexuality leads Rachel to see \u201cher life for the first time [as] a creeping hedged-in thing, driven cautiously between high walls, here turned aside, there plunged in darkness, made dull and crippled forever\u201d (87). She suddenly starts to understand how gendered expectations restrict and direct behavior. This emerging sense of limitation foregrounds the conflict between the normative rituals associated with Rachel\u2019s \u201cculturally determined destiny\u201d as a wife and mother, as Christine Froula has argued, and her desire to \u201cbreak out of the female initiation plot that her culture imposes upon women, constituting them not as fully legitimated participants in history and culture.\u201dFootnote43 Woolf\u2019s concerns with this process of legitimation are linked to the institutional hierarchies that create disparities between those who can claim to be possessors of the means of knowledge production and those who can only acquire the resulting outcomes, a distinction which radically alters the balance of power in the practice of recognition.\n\nThe Voyage Out interrogates the role literature and practices of reading play in the establishments of these hierarchies, particularly as they relate to the education of women. As Friedman observes, \u201cthe reading of people\u201d and \u201cthe reading of books\u201d in the novel are often presented as binary opposites \u2013 the former related to the social sphere, and generally the domain of women and the latter, linked to the institutional production of knowledge, and thus reserved for men.Footnote44 The politics of reading was a topic that clearly occupied Woolf during the extended composition period of the novel, stretching from 1908 to 1913, during which she completed several essays on the topic.Footnote45 In the novel itself, Rachel receives instruction on her reading by various male characters, including Richard Dalloway, St John Hirst and her uncle, Ridley Ambrose. Mr Dalloway suggests Burke\u2019s writings on the American and French revolutions to induce a development of a political conscience. St John recommends Gibbon\u2019s multivolume history of the Roman empire as a way to test the viability of her mind. Mr Ambrose offers a course of learning based on the contents of his travel library that stretches from Balzac back to Marlowe.Footnote46 In his study, she is allowed to select her own reading and leaves with Le Cousine Bette (1846), a novel which displays women\u2019s insubordinate behavior as a persistent threat to the bourgeois stability of the family unit.\n\nAs the narrative develops, it is through the study and performance of literary characters that Rachel begins to take a more definite shape:\n\n\u201cWhat I want to know,\u201d she said aloud, \u201cis this: What is the truth? What is the truth of it all?\u201d She was speaking partly as herself and partly as the heroine of the play she had just read. [\u2009\u2026\u2009] for the moment she herself was the most vivid thing in it \u2013 a heroic statue in the middle of the foreground, dominating the view. Ibsen\u2019s plays always left her in that condition. She acted them for days at a time, greatly to Helen\u2019s amusement; and then it would be Meredith\u2019s turn and she became Diana of the Crossways, but Helen was aware that it was not all acting, and that some sort of change was taking place in the human being. (136\u20137)\n\nRachel\u2019s selection of texts focuses on the stories of modern women who inhabit a hostile world and commit various transgressive acts to free themselves from the confines associated with their gender identity.Footnote47 Her choices also reflect a forming idea of social inequality as Ibsen is followed \u201cby a novel such as Mrs Ambrose detested, whose purpose was to distribute the guilt of a woman\u2019s downfall upon the right shoulders\u201d (138). In addition to providing her with examples of womanhood, modern fiction also offers a space for experimentation with language. She reads the shiny, yellow-covered books \u201cwith the curious literalness of one to whom written sentences are unfamiliar, and handling words as though they were made of wood, separately of great importance, and possessed of shapes like tables and chairs\u201d (137\u20138). Rachel uses the language of literary representation to learn the normative shapes and sizes of modern human experience, and particularly that of women, aware that words carry the weight of the meanings ascribed to them. This experience of trying on fictional characters highlights the collaborative force with which language, norms, and forms come together to formulate the recognizable models of identification available to the modern reader.\nRachel\u2019s education and reading practice slowly create an archive of linguistic and behavioral codes to help her construct a picture of a coherent gendered personhood. As her performance within her social circle improves and reaches the expected standard, Mrs Ambrose directly gives her permission to be a person:\n\n\u201cSo now you can go ahead and be a person on your own account,\u201d she added. The vision of her own personality, of herself as a real everlasting thing, different from anything else, unmergeable, like the see or the wind, flashed in Rachel\u2019s mind, and she became profoundly excited at the thought of living. (90)\n\nRachel\u2019s jubilation at this prospect does not materialize in a conscious effort of making herself into a \u201creal everlasting thing\u201d; instead, she slides out of view at every chance of establishing herself, a practice encouraged by her eclectic reading. As Butler argues, the draw towards accounting for oneself as a singular subject, in search for social validation, is a crucial step in the practice of recognition, that inevitably comes to clash with the necessity to do so within a normative framework of social relations. Any such account will have to involve parts that do not belong to the subject, whether because they are linked with the norms that direct her own self-constitution or the norms that guide her expression and intelligibility. In this respect, Butler asserts, \u201cit is only in dispossession that I can and do give an account of myself.\u201dFootnote48 Having \u201clearned something about the social limits to her possibilities,\u201d in Hite\u2019s formulation, Rachel is shown to realize the constrained scope of agential action, determined by the gender norms associated with her self-development, within which she is allowed to operate.Footnote49 The novel also adapts to this disruption of the recognition arc and its \u201crepresentational strategies\u201d and begins to \u201cdefine her body more and more in terms of an observer\u2019s gaze,\u201d manifesting its awareness that \u201cthe knowledge of and entrance into the public realm involve endangering other kinds of knowledge and other realms of ontological contact.\u201dFootnote50\nEntering the public sphere\nFollowing her experience of self-consciousness triggered by the confrontation with Terence\u2019s demand, Rachel perceives that the shapes she can inhabit that can generate recognition in response are always already there, carved out of normative demands. The implied function of recognition as a regulation principle, which determines the forms of identity that can be legitimately adopted within the wider normative order, is exposed during the Sunday church service. Rachel looks at the faces she knows from luncheons, walks, and card games and for the first time regards them as fabricated. This realization triggers a process of Cartesian revelation, which makes her reject \u201call that she had implicitly believed\u201d (265). She is unsettled by her fellow travelers\u2019 need for validation, which makes them into \u201cslavishly acquiescent [\u2009\u2026\u2009] limpet[s],\u201d who allow themselves to be co-opted within a deeply suspect economy of exchange (265). Rachel\u2019s internal monologue shows her becoming critically aware of the norms of legibility which govern the social order in which she is expected to enlist. This is the closest the novel comes to articulating a scene of recognition in the traditional sense and it is significant that Rachel\u2019s transition from a position of relative inexperience to one of \u201cenlightenment\u201d occurs not as an act of self-reflection, but as one of public reading. In her previous encounters with the male characters who demand an account of herself, she has been evasive, impersonal, but never fully open or entirely paradigmatic as a participant in the economy of desire. Instinctively aware of the threat recognition carries for her own singularity, she is not prepared to be transparent to others, her presence in interpersonal exchanges being marked by a curious elusiveness and withholding of substance. Woolf\u2019s own elusiveness in terms of offering \u201cauthorial guidance\u201d functions not only through the presentation of \u201cconflicting tonal cues\u201d in relation to the reading of characters, but through her deliberate refusal to structure her narrative around the recognition coordinates expected of it.Footnote51 In this way, she also expands her critical examination from its initial focus on the normative links that are used to construct the novel as a form primary concerned with the representation of personhood, into the \u201cpolitical stakes of the specific work of literary production.\u201dFootnote52\n\nWoolf\u2019s skeptical attitude towards the function of the literary establishment, which to a large extent determines the relationship between texts, authors, and readers, forms an important part of her larger institutional critique. She is particularly disparaging in her evaluation of the British reading public\u2019s attachment to norms, expectations, and habitual practices. She declares it \u201ca very suggestible and docile creature,\u201d which often persists in supporting commonly held notions. In her view, the public generally wants books to confirm their own view of the world, without much defiance:\n\n[o]ld women have houses. They have fathers. They have incomes. They have hot-water bottles. This is how we know that they are old women. Mr Wells and Mr Bennett and Mr Galsworthy have always taught us that this is the way to recognise them.Footnote53\n\nA relationship of this kind conducted on the basis of supply and demand principles, for Woolf, \u201cceases to be a means of communication between writer and reader, and becomes instead an obstacle and an impediment.\u201dFootnote54 This misconception of the novel\u2019s function underscores its implied cooperation with the maintenance of established social standards in the context of patriarchal capitalist modernity. As Victoria Baena argues, through a reading of Walter Benjamin\u2019s 1934 essay \u201cThe Author as a Producer,\u201d the \u201crole of the intellectual\u201d should be understood \u201cless in terms of political \u2018commitment\u2019 than as the writer of works that change or at least challenge the world\u201d \u2013 an apt description of Woolf\u2019s statement of intent in her debut novel and a lens through which to read her subsequent experiments with literary work in all its guises, as a form of feminist social criticism.Footnote55\nAfter the church scene, Rachel begins to fade away from the narrative. Her status as a protagonist is repeatedly disrupted and diminished instead of asserted and expanded; until, finally, her death is reduced to a conversation topic after tea. Even when she accepts Terence\u2019s offer of marriage during their visit to an Indigenous village, she is not really a person with a mind of her own, and only echoes the sentiments he offers her, adhering to social protocol.\n\n\u201cYou like being with me?\u201d Terence asked. \u201cYes, with you,\u201d she replied. [\u2009\u2026\u2009] \u201cWe are happy together.\u201d He did not seem to be speaking, or she to be hearing. \u201cVery happy,\u201d she answered. [\u2009\u2026\u2009] \u201cWe love each other,\u201d Terence said. \u201cWe love each other,\u201d she repeated. (316)\n\nRachel\u2019s position in the novel becomes further obscured as other characters start relating to her as Terence\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, following the announcement of the engagement. Their previous caution towards her is quickly overcome by her identification as a social presence they can recognize. While returning \u201cThank You\u201d notes she thinks it strange that \u201cconsidering how very different these people were, [\u2009\u2026\u2009] they used almost the same sentences when they wrote to congratulate her upon her engagement\u201d (342). Shortly after this, Rachel\u2019s fever overcomes her and she slips out of consciousness.Footnote56 This is the final act of dispossession the novel performs. The form of personhood available to her as a married woman obstructs all other possible accounts she might have wished to draw for herself. Even though Rachel agrees to become Terence\u2019s wife, the norms which govern this decision are not hers to make but are hers to comply with. As Butler asserts,\none invariably struggles with conditions of one\u2019s own life that one could not have chosen. If there is an operation of agency or, indeed, freedom in this struggle, it takes place in the context of an enabling and limiting field of constraint.\n\nBy allowing Rachel to break out of the characterization model allocated for women in the Bildungsroman, Woolf undermines the exercise of choice as an expression of agency, and with that the entire foundation on which the \u201cidealized representation of [the] autonomous male subject\u201d rests.Footnote58 Rachel\u2019s disrupted narrative shows that under conditions of patriarchal oppression, the self-determination narrative, mapped out across various points of recognition, becomes another form of control.\nConclusion\nIn theoretical terms, literary character has almost exclusively been discussed as a universal concept, nearly an ideal, akin to that of the autonomous Kantian subject, and in many ways designed to replicate it. Its failures and successes are decided by the same measure. It is often encumbered by expectations of accuracy, truthfulness, and relatability, which all combine to curate a reading process organized around the principle of recognition, both as an aesthetic and political construct. Woolf, however, saw this as a rather restrictive convention and made her opposition to it the cornerstone of her critical engagement with modern fiction. One of the reasons she questioned recognition-based principles for the construction and reading of fiction was connected to a concern about the potential of this convention to narrow the field of authorial invention and thus obscure the novel\u2019s ability to respond to changing social realities. Another, was a more broadly political one, connected to the representation of women in fiction. Woolf worried that a recognition-based model for the construction of personhood, can be used to support a binary world of power and gender relations, where norms are used to control the formation and expressions of identity and the ways in which they can be legitimized. Woolf\u2019s interest in this project, initiated in her first novel and continued throughout her writing life, is not confined to simply decoding the restrictive and implicit dangers of relying on such models in fiction as well as in life. Her first novel begins the work of proposing a new code of practice that would support more diverse forms of personhood and engender the formation of novel and emancipatory forms of political life. In this project the purpose of the novelist appears to be nothing short of imagining personhood anew, of learning to re-cognize it, and deliver it from the confines of its traditional forms.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The writing style and tone of the analyzed text is academic and analytical.

It argues that her dissatisfaction with traditional modes of women\u2019s characterization stems from their reliance on recognizable patriarchal models of personhood, an unhealthy dependence which restricts the development of new forms of gendered political and personal identification. This reading uses the concept of recognition, as understood in the post-Hegelian feminist tradition, as a key structuring and interpretative tool to demonstrate Woolf\u2019s early critical insight into the fraught relationship between idealized narratives of individual autonomy and gender. In doing so, it makes a case for the broader inclusion of recognition as a critical term of inquiry in modernist studies, both as an aesthetic and political site of contention.\n\n\nIntroduction\nVirginia Woolf\u2019s contemporaries often highlight characterization as a flaw in her writing practice. This common critical trope accompanies the publications of all her novels, starting with the very first, The Voyage Out (1915). An unsigned review in the Nation, for example, declares it \u201chardly a work of art. Partly because of its form, partly because it is too passionately intent upon vivisection.\u201d Despite offering generous praise for the execution of nearly every other aspect of the text, E. M. Forster finds that the \u201ccharacters are not vivid. [\u2009\u2026\u2009] they do not stroll out of their sentences, and even develop a tendency to merge shadow-like.\u201dWoolf\u2019s reactions to such comments were initially confined to her diaries and personal correspondence and ranged from frustration to acquiescence. Towards the end of the 1910s and early 1920s, however, they began to take a more distinct and public shape as a loose theory of modern fiction, developed in celebrated essays such as \u201cModern Novels\u201d (1919), \u201cReading\u201d (1919), \u201cMr Bennett and Mrs Brown\u201d (1923/4), and \u201cCharacter in Fiction\u201d (1924).Footnote3\n\nThe clamor of voices decrying the insufficiencies of modernist characters was a common feature in the critical landscape of the day, particularly when discussing novels of development and education, like The Voyage Out. As Jed Esty argues modernists often tried to circumvent the Bildungsroman\u2019s \u201cgeneric dictates or to revise them out of recognition.\u201dFootnote4 As a result, their modifications of the traditional developmental trajectories followed by its protagonists, associated with a process of learning and successful adaptation to social norms, tend to \u201cblock or defer the attainment of a mature social role.\u201dFootnote5 For Esty, Woolf\u2019s novel accomplishes just such an intervention through the workings of its plot and setting, which position its characters firmly within the histories of colonial contact, displacement, and migration.Footnote6 Susan Stanford Friedman also focuses on the text\u2019s challenges to the \u201corthodoxies of representation\u201d and its defiance of the \u201cboundaries of expectation as these have been erected by literary tradition.\u201dFootnote7 This reading concentrates explicitly on the function of women in the successful execution of the marriage plot and raises important questions about the role of gender in conventionally constructed narratives of development. The category of the \u201cfemale Bildungsroman,\u201d under which The Voyage Out was classified by early critics, has been in feminist critical parlance since at least the 1970s, chiefly occupying itself with investigating how women writers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries represented \u201cthe suppression and defeat of female autonomy, creativity, and maturity by patriarchal gender norms.\u201dFootnote8 In their well-known study in this tradition, Elizabeth Abel, Marianne Hirsch, and Elizabeth Langland, argue that the traditional Bildungsroman excludes gender \u201cas a pertinent category,\u201d an omission that has had direct effects on the dominant models for its \u201cnarrative structure,\u201d \u201cpsychology,\u201d and \u201crepresentation of social pressures.\u201dFootnote9 What is more, reading the history of the Bildungsroman as a document of the development of modern subjectivity, \u201cone could be tempted to conclude that the gender of modernity is indeed male,\u201d an impression, which, as Rita Felski states, calls for a sustained critique of the \u201cidealized representation of the autonomous male subject.\u201dFootnote10\n\nAs I will argue in what follows, Woolf\u2019s first novel engages in performing precisely this task and in doing so exhibits the development of a related interest in Woolf\u2019s thought. That is, the representation of women in fiction as a political problem, which is brought to bear on the aesthetic strategies of character construction and the hermeneutic practices employed to interpret them. Consequently, this article places emphasis on character, rather than plot formation, in order to bring to light Woolf\u2019s early insight into the regulatory power of reading norms. While the Bildungsroman plot in The Voyage Out allows Woolf to formulate a direct challenge to the narrative of development, as it relates to women\u2019s lives, her concerns go beyond a criticism of the limited social positions they are allowed to occupy.Footnote11 Directing her critical focus towards traditional models of characterization, heavily underwritten by the ideal of self-determination, shows that she identifies the very construction of the subject, in and through the normative conditions of power relations that shape our experiences as gendered and embodied agents, as a site of contention, anticipating much contemporary feminist theory on the topic. Furthermore, it lays the foundation of her critique of institutionalism and the forms of knowledge it engenders and propagates, which she elaborates more completely through her essays and novels of the 1920s and 1930s. As stated by Stephanie J. Brown in a recent essay, feminist approaches to Woolf\u2019s writing have been successful in instilling the importance of attending carefully to her \u201cgrowing conviction that existing institutions are structured by an ineradicably patriarchal logic, and therefore inadequate to the needs of women and to the requirements of a just society.\u201dFootnote12 Elucidating the ways in which Woolf sees this inadequacy as functioning through the narrative and hermeneutic norms which govern the literary representations of personhood, is the main objective of this article.\n\nTo begin this discussion, I would like to return to the term \u201crecognition,\u201d used in passing by Esty. Despite playing an important role within larger histories of ideas associated with personal autonomy and democratic social organization, the concept of recognition has been insufficiently developed in literary studies, as Felski has recently observed.Footnote13 Some consideration of recognition has taken place, mainly as a principle of poetics, derived from the Aristotelian notion of anagnorisis, which is generally understood to signify a moment of transition from ignorance to knowledge.Footnote14 These reflections have largely taken place within a framework of realist forms of representation, which tend to rely on a narrative logic of an inevitable revelation of purpose and meaning, a feature very much in operation within the Bildugnsroman, and one, which, as outlined above, the modernist novel of this kind tends to undermine. Hence, recognition in this sense, despite its customary operation as a principle of identity construction, has been deemed largely immaterial for modernist criticism in general, and feminist modernist criticism in particular. The larger political point encoded within the problem of recognition as an organizational device in fiction, which often evades detection, is brought into focus by Woolf\u2019s narrative of her young protagonist, Rachel Vinrace, who undertakes the task of becoming a socially recognizable individual within the context of a patriarchal economy of knowledge.Footnote15 The novel stages Rachel\u2019s engagement as the culmination of this educational process, the narrative and hermeneutic end of the literary imagination, followed by the young heroine\u2019s death. In a sense, this is the highest form anagnorisis can attain and its ultimate limitation \u2013 fiction constructed on this model, cannot see beyond that which is knowable, or even that which is known. As Ben Parker observes, it is at the point that the Aristotelian notion begins to acquire Hegelian echoes. \u201cThe logic of recognition,\u201d he writes, \u201cpresumes an ultimate knowability: the truth of subjectivity requires a detour though otherness,\u201d a detour obstructed under the conditions of capitalist modernity and the norms of identity development it espouses.Footnote16\n\nContemporary political theories of recognition also trace back to Hegel. His concept of Anerkennung as developed in the Phenomenology of Spirit (1807) is concerned with the constitution of knowing subjects, which he sees not as an isolated activity, but one which must be performed in communion with others: \u201c[s]elf-consciousness exists in and for itself when, and by the fact that, it so exists for another self-another; that is, it exists only in being acknowledged.\u201dFootnote17 This process upholds for Hegel the infinite nature of this two-fold exchange in dialectical opposition to the determinateness of self-consciousness. In other words, the subject has to be recognized by others and have its claims to personhood validated through intersubjective acknowledgement within the social sphere in order to escape the laws of its own determination. This also leads to establishing an autonomous sense of self and the creation of ethical obligations for the treatment of others. However, receiving and granting recognition under conditions of social inequality raises questions about the hierarchies of value generated by this exchange. Feminist philosophers continue to dispute the usefulness of recognition as a formative principle for democratic social structures, within which women can find emancipation. A significant voice in these debates is Judith Butler, whose concerns regarding the concept and its relationship to oppression are deep and persistent, as further discussion below will demonstrate. The benefits of reading Woolf in tandem with Butler have been brought into sharp focus by Elsa H\u00f6gberg, who examines the practice of recognition as an ethical counterpart to the problem of violence in the work of both authors. While H\u00f6gberg\u2019s study focuses on the interwar novels, from Jacob\u2019s Room (1922) to The Waves (1931), my analysis locates Woolf\u2019s interest in constructing new \u201caesthetic strategies for reconfiguring individuality\u201d at an even earlier moment, in her debut novel.Footnote18 It also explicitly takes up these strategies\u2019 gendered dimensions, focalized in The Voyage Out through Rachel\u2019s course of development towards acquiring a recognizable form of personhood in keeping with the limitations imposed by her social position as a young woman.\n\nStriving for recognition\nJudith Butler understands recognition as an essential aspect both of self-formation and interpersonal relations, part of a reciprocal communal exchange, for which \u201cwe are all, in different ways, striving.\u201dFootnote19 This is to say that recognition is a common human condition, a token of validation we require to affirm our existence as functioning agents within the social sphere. This fundamental reliance, for Butler, engenders certain dependencies which make us vulnerable to others as well as to the very norms that govern our relations with the wider world. In The Psychic Life of Power, she outlines this situation as one of \u201cprimary dependency [which] conditions the political formation and regulation of the subject and becomes the means of their subjection.\u201dFootnote20 The subject then is \u201cformed in submission\u201d to power \u201cthat at first appears as external, pressed upon the subject,\u201d but in \u201cpressing the subject into subordination, assumes a psychic form that constitutes the subject\u2019s self-identity.\u201dFootnote21 This relationship within which personhood is born, is one that \u201cinitiates and sustains our agency\u201d but also restricts and controls it.Footnote22 The concept of recognition, on this account, becomes implicated in practices of control, prevalent within the paradigmatic structure of power relations that shape the individual within a patriarchal context. Despite its subordinating power, however, recognition continues to be a necessary process due to our psychic and social need for it. In Butler\u2019s view, the subject in the process of self-formation either has to accept this form of subordinating relations or forgo participation in social life altogether. Both options prove undesirable, in different ways, harboring the illusion of a meaningful choice. The resistance strategy she offers is framed through a process of re-signification of the terms and practices individuals utilize to counter the prevalent logic of subjection such as forms of \u201ccritical desubjectivation\u201d and \u201cincoherence of identity.\u201dFootnote23\n\nWoolf\u2019s position, as it emerges in The Voyage Out itself and later essays carries more ambiguity. In the first instance, she situates recognition within the reading process, as a tool of characterization, and acknowledges its instrumental function for engendering a productive connection between writer, reader, and text. In \u201cCharacter in Fiction,\u201d she states that\n\n[t]he writer must get into touch with his reader by putting before him something which he recognises, which therefore stimulates his imagination, and makes him co-operate in the far more difficult business of intimacy. And it is of the highest importance that this common meeting-place should be reached easily, almost instinctively, in the dark, with one\u2019s eyes shut.Footnote24\n\nA shared experience emerges from this state of being in common with others. Establishing this intersubjective \u201cmeeting-place\u201d relies on a relationship of recognition between the reader and the forms of personhood they encounter in the text. When left to work in peace, the norms of judgement determine the types of fictional representation that can be recognized as characteristic of personhood. When they are meddled with, the entire socio-epistemological functioning of the reading process is endangered. The difficulty Woolf identifies for the writer is that the construction of a common space around a practice of recognition can constrain the emergence of new forms of identification, as well as the author\u2019s aesthetic field of experimentation. This complication, also formulated by Butler, arises through the demand to give an account of oneself, or to become legible, within the social sphere. In doing this, the subject is confronted with the exchange of their singularity for a measure of recognizability. \u201cIf I try to give an account of myself,\u201d she states:\nif I try to make myself recognizable and understandable [\u2009\u2026\u2009] I will, to some degree, have to make myself substitutable in order to make myself recognizable. The narrative authority of the \u201cI\u201d must give way to the perspective and temporality of a set of norms that contest the singularity of my own story.Footnote25\n\nIn The Voyage Out, Rachel comes to experience this demand directly on several occasions, usually when asked to introduce herself. During an outing, St John Hirst, one of her companions, proposes that each member of their party should provide \u201ca short biographical sketch.\u201dFootnote26 In response, Rachel states that she is \u201ctwenty-four years of age, the daughter of a ship-owner, that she had never been properly educated; played the piano, had no brothers or sisters, and lived at Richmond with her aunts, her mother being dead\u201d (159). This matter-of-fact description is only comparable in substance to the Who\u2019s Who compendium of short biographies of famous historical figures Rachel reads on board her father\u2019s ship, which takes her to the fictional colonial location of Santa Marina, where most of the novel\u2019s action takes place.Footnote27 She issues this string of facts, referring to her age, class, educational status, family history, and her sole occupation efficiently and impersonally, as if in fear or under duress, each comma marking yet another aspect of her social personhood. She presents herself as a common, not a singular being, one of many, her identity not porous, but impermeable, forged under the pressure of the unforgivable inevitability of norms.\nTerence Hewet, an aspiring novelist, and Rachel\u2019s future fianc\u00e9e, also challenges her to give an account of herself. At Terence\u2019s prompt, \u201cRachel,\u201d the narrator states, \u201clost her freedom and became self-conscious. She felt herself at once singular and under observation\u201d (245). For Felski, this would constitute a moment of recognition, which, unlike Butler, she sees as a potentially generative experience. When we engage in a process of recognition, she writes, \u201cwe make sense of what is unfamiliar by fitting it into an existing scheme, linking it to what we already know.\u201dFootnote28 But this initial connection with the norms we recognize does not have to produce an experience that is repetitive, derivative, or in any way subordinating. Instead, it could show us things in a new light, compelling us to imagine a \u201crevised or altered sense of who I am.\u201dFootnote29 On her reading, the self-conscious moment can simultaneously serve \u201cas a social diagnosis and an ethical judgement.\u201dFootnote30 As a result, she advocates preserving a certain epistemological openness, which harbors the potential to create new forms of self-knowledge that can be taken up by the subject through a phenomenological relation of \u201cself-scrutiny rather than self-loss.\u201dFootnote31\n\nThe startling experience of self-consciousness, provoked in Rachel by Terence\u2019s demand, however, is presented by Woolf as inimical to her freedom. Overwhelmed by the demands of recognition, the self-realization that she must become intelligible as a subject of norms threatens her capacity for generating self-knowledge. The realization that he sees her as a woman additionally inhibits Rachel\u2019s ability to communicate an individual position. Furthermore, she feels constrained and \u201champered,\u201d the necessity of self-scrutiny only revealing more loss of possibility (246\u20137). In this moment of self-consciousness Rachel comprehends her dependence on Terence and her own vulnerability, exposing Woolf\u2019s own critique of recognition predicated on the certainty of knowledge as model of emancipation. Instead, Rachel\u2019s freedom is diminished, she becomes an object of enquiry, of knowledge, and of desire, which can be mastered and acquired by others.Footnote32 Once she perceives her newly drawn outline produced through Terence\u2019s recognition of her womanhood, she is compelled to inhabit it by modifying or relinquishing other fragments of her identity. In this way, the norm prevails, forcing an act of dispossession.Footnote33 Louise DeSalvo draws attention to the differences between the first English edition of the novel and the first American one, published five years later, at this crucial moment in the development of the relationship between Rachel and Terence. The American edition, DeSalvo observes, offers a more combative Rachel, who refuses to be \u201cpinned down by any second person,\u201d which demonstrates Woolf\u2019s heightened attention to emphasizing the disbalance in the hermeneutic positions which Rachel and Terence occupy in this exchange.Footnote34 Rachel never demands a reciprocal account from Terence, allowing him the possibility to escape self-scrutiny and categorization. The novel purposefully refuses to represent this exchange between the two lovers as reciprocal and equal, a point which serves to complicate models of analysing ethical readings of recognition as \u201cdyadic encounters,\u201d which tend to equalize the power both agents hold in the validation of one another.Footnote35 In the context of a social infrastructure built upon networks of patriarchal power, Woolf seems to be suggesting, the position of women in this exercise, is one of deep disadvantage. In this sense, the common meeting place becomes less of a democratic locus for reinvention and more of a battleground for survival.\n\nBecoming a person\nEarly in the novel, Rachel is described as someone who is struggling to become a person. The prime impediments to this are associated with her ability to adequately employ her rational faculties, accumulate knowledge, and exercise command over her language. \u201cA hesitation in speaking,\u201d the narrator observes, \u201cor rather a tendency to use the wrong words, made her seem more than normally incompetent for her years\u201d (15\u201316). Further on we are told that \u201cher eyes were unreflecting as water\u201d and \u201cher mind was absent\u201d (17). As Allison Pease notes, this is not an unusual representation of womanhood in early twentieth-century literature. Rachel \u201chas failed the qualifications of post-Cartesian selfhood,\u201d she \u201cknows nothing; she thinks and feels, but she is an outsider to a system that produces knowing individuals.\u201dFootnote36 The inability to find the words to express her thoughts is a source of confusion both for Rachel herself and the people around her. Her preference for musical over literary forms of expression, reflective of her discomfort with explicit verbal identifications, is evident throughout the text. As a result, Rachel is seen as someone who is not possessed of the ability to generate rational certainty, making this one of the main issues in terms of her characterization. Emma Sutton connects this to her \u201cinarticulateness\u201d and the difficulties of expressing the intense richness of inner thought through the limited commands of spoken language.Footnote37 Molly Hite goes even further to suggest that in favoring \u201can inherently nonrepresentational\u201d art of expression for Rachel, Woolf curates \u201can aesthetic form that invents rather than represents.\u201dFootnote38 Music creates modalities of connection and identification that are non-structural and non-hierarchical, and allow Rachel to give full expression to the complexities of her interiority without having to negotiate the struggle for recognition.\n\nIn a novel, whose characters\u2019 chief occupation, as Eric Sandberg observes, is \u201cdefining, or characterizing, other people,\u201d Rachel\u2019s lack of clear outline presents a puzzle.Footnote39 In addition to failing the Cartesian principles of selfhood, rooted in rational self-examination, she seems to lack awareness of the gendered aspects of socialization. Mrs Helen Ambrose, her aunt, functions as a figure of female authority, whose role is to induct Rachel in traditional practices of womanhood, including those associated with motherhood and marriage. She takes it upon herself to \u201cenlighten\u201d (105) the young woman, whose sheltered upbringing by her two (unmarried) aunts, following the death of her mother, according to Helen, is the reason why she appears so removed from worldly interpersonal affairs, especially those associated with sexual desire. Rachel\u2019s encounter with Mr Dalloway on the ship to Santa Marina, provides a brief and unwelcome disclosure in this regard. During one of their brief conversations, he prompts: \u201c\u2018[\u2009\u2026\u2009] Now tell me about yourself. What are your interests and occupations?\u2019\u201d Rachel responds: \u201c\u2018You see, I\u2019m a woman\u2019\u201d (79).Footnote40 Her admission is met with an outburst of passion, which moves Mr Dalloway to assault her with a kiss, following which he misdirects responsibility for the violent act and accuses her of temptation. The direct second-person address, \u201c\u2018You tempt me,\u2019\u201d summons an act of individual agency Rachel is unable to account for (80). Her resulting feelings range from discomfort to fear, she is unable to sleep and stop thinking about the experience, feeling persecuted and entrapped. She confides in Helen, who simply explains that this is the way things are between men and women: \u201cit\u2019s the most natural thing in the world\u201d (86). This leads Rachel to formulate a link between herself and \u201cthose women in Piccadilly,\u201d who her aunt confirms are prostitutes (86). As Hite emphasizes, \u201cthe existence and meaning of the prostitute are of acute importance to a young girl entering the arena of sexual arrangements.\u201dFootnote41 The topic emerges again in a discussion with Evelyn Murgatroyd, another character in the novel, who is trying to navigate her marriage prospects, when it is explicitly linked to the economic foundations of marriage, understood as a \u201crelation of sexual ownership.\u201dFootnote42 The process of becoming a person recognizable by others for Rachel, as for Evelyn, and the rest of the women in the novel, is inevitably tied with negotiating the terms on which their bodies will be interpreted, valued, and possessed. The moment of confrontation with patriarchal sexuality leads Rachel to see \u201cher life for the first time [as] a creeping hedged-in thing, driven cautiously between high walls, here turned aside, there plunged in darkness, made dull and crippled forever\u201d (87). She suddenly starts to understand how gendered expectations restrict and direct behavior. This emerging sense of limitation foregrounds the conflict between the normative rituals associated with Rachel\u2019s \u201cculturally determined destiny\u201d as a wife and mother, as Christine Froula has argued, and her desire to \u201cbreak out of the female initiation plot that her culture imposes upon women, constituting them not as fully legitimated participants in history and culture.\u201dFootnote43 Woolf\u2019s concerns with this process of legitimation are linked to the institutional hierarchies that create disparities between those who can claim to be possessors of the means of knowledge production and those who can only acquire the resulting outcomes, a distinction which radically alters the balance of power in the practice of recognition.\n\nThe Voyage Out interrogates the role literature and practices of reading play in the establishments of these hierarchies, particularly as they relate to the education of women. As Friedman observes, \u201cthe reading of people\u201d and \u201cthe reading of books\u201d in the novel are often presented as binary opposites \u2013 the former related to the social sphere, and generally the domain of women and the latter, linked to the institutional production of knowledge, and thus reserved for men.Footnote44 The politics of reading was a topic that clearly occupied Woolf during the extended composition period of the novel, stretching from 1908 to 1913, during which she completed several essays on the topic.Footnote45 In the novel itself, Rachel receives instruction on her reading by various male characters, including Richard Dalloway, St John Hirst and her uncle, Ridley Ambrose. Mr Dalloway suggests Burke\u2019s writings on the American and French revolutions to induce a development of a political conscience. St John recommends Gibbon\u2019s multivolume history of the Roman empire as a way to test the viability of her mind. Mr Ambrose offers a course of learning based on the contents of his travel library that stretches from Balzac back to Marlowe.Footnote46 In his study, she is allowed to select her own reading and leaves with Le Cousine Bette (1846), a novel which displays women\u2019s insubordinate behavior as a persistent threat to the bourgeois stability of the family unit.\n\nAs the narrative develops, it is through the study and performance of literary characters that Rachel begins to take a more definite shape:\n\n\u201cWhat I want to know,\u201d she said aloud, \u201cis this: What is the truth? What is the truth of it all?\u201d She was speaking partly as herself and partly as the heroine of the play she had just read. [\u2009\u2026\u2009] for the moment she herself was the most vivid thing in it \u2013 a heroic statue in the middle of the foreground, dominating the view. Ibsen\u2019s plays always left her in that condition. She acted them for days at a time, greatly to Helen\u2019s amusement; and then it would be Meredith\u2019s turn and she became Diana of the Crossways, but Helen was aware that it was not all acting, and that some sort of change was taking place in the human being. (136\u20137)\n\nRachel\u2019s selection of texts focuses on the stories of modern women who inhabit a hostile world and commit various transgressive acts to free themselves from the confines associated with their gender identity.Footnote47 Her choices also reflect a forming idea of social inequality as Ibsen is followed \u201cby a novel such as Mrs Ambrose detested, whose purpose was to distribute the guilt of a woman\u2019s downfall upon the right shoulders\u201d (138). In addition to providing her with examples of womanhood, modern fiction also offers a space for experimentation with language. She reads the shiny, yellow-covered books \u201cwith the curious literalness of one to whom written sentences are unfamiliar, and handling words as though they were made of wood, separately of great importance, and possessed of shapes like tables and chairs\u201d (137\u20138). Rachel uses the language of literary representation to learn the normative shapes and sizes of modern human experience, and particularly that of women, aware that words carry the weight of the meanings ascribed to them. This experience of trying on fictional characters highlights the collaborative force with which language, norms, and forms come together to formulate the recognizable models of identification available to the modern reader.\nRachel\u2019s education and reading practice slowly create an archive of linguistic and behavioral codes to help her construct a picture of a coherent gendered personhood. As her performance within her social circle improves and reaches the expected standard, Mrs Ambrose directly gives her permission to be a person:\n\n\u201cSo now you can go ahead and be a person on your own account,\u201d she added. The vision of her own personality, of herself as a real everlasting thing, different from anything else, unmergeable, like the see or the wind, flashed in Rachel\u2019s mind, and she became profoundly excited at the thought of living. (90)\n\nRachel\u2019s jubilation at this prospect does not materialize in a conscious effort of making herself into a \u201creal everlasting thing\u201d; instead, she slides out of view at every chance of establishing herself, a practice encouraged by her eclectic reading. As Butler argues, the draw towards accounting for oneself as a singular subject, in search for social validation, is a crucial step in the practice of recognition, that inevitably comes to clash with the necessity to do so within a normative framework of social relations. Any such account will have to involve parts that do not belong to the subject, whether because they are linked with the norms that direct her own self-constitution or the norms that guide her expression and intelligibility. In this respect, Butler asserts, \u201cit is only in dispossession that I can and do give an account of myself.\u201dFootnote48 Having \u201clearned something about the social limits to her possibilities,\u201d in Hite\u2019s formulation, Rachel is shown to realize the constrained scope of agential action, determined by the gender norms associated with her self-development, within which she is allowed to operate.Footnote49 The novel also adapts to this disruption of the recognition arc and its \u201crepresentational strategies\u201d and begins to \u201cdefine her body more and more in terms of an observer\u2019s gaze,\u201d manifesting its awareness that \u201cthe knowledge of and entrance into the public realm involve endangering other kinds of knowledge and other realms of ontological contact.\u201dFootnote50\nEntering the public sphere\nFollowing her experience of self-consciousness triggered by the confrontation with Terence\u2019s demand, Rachel perceives that the shapes she can inhabit that can generate recognition in response are always already there, carved out of normative demands. The implied function of recognition as a regulation principle, which determines the forms of identity that can be legitimately adopted within the wider normative order, is exposed during the Sunday church service. Rachel looks at the faces she knows from luncheons, walks, and card games and for the first time regards them as fabricated. This realization triggers a process of Cartesian revelation, which makes her reject \u201call that she had implicitly believed\u201d (265). She is unsettled by her fellow travelers\u2019 need for validation, which makes them into \u201cslavishly acquiescent [\u2009\u2026\u2009] limpet[s],\u201d who allow themselves to be co-opted within a deeply suspect economy of exchange (265). Rachel\u2019s internal monologue shows her becoming critically aware of the norms of legibility which govern the social order in which she is expected to enlist. This is the closest the novel comes to articulating a scene of recognition in the traditional sense and it is significant that Rachel\u2019s transition from a position of relative inexperience to one of \u201cenlightenment\u201d occurs not as an act of self-reflection, but as one of public reading. In her previous encounters with the male characters who demand an account of herself, she has been evasive, impersonal, but never fully open or entirely paradigmatic as a participant in the economy of desire. Instinctively aware of the threat recognition carries for her own singularity, she is not prepared to be transparent to others, her presence in interpersonal exchanges being marked by a curious elusiveness and withholding of substance. Woolf\u2019s own elusiveness in terms of offering \u201cauthorial guidance\u201d functions not only through the presentation of \u201cconflicting tonal cues\u201d in relation to the reading of characters, but through her deliberate refusal to structure her narrative around the recognition coordinates expected of it.Footnote51 In this way, she also expands her critical examination from its initial focus on the normative links that are used to construct the novel as a form primary concerned with the representation of personhood, into the \u201cpolitical stakes of the specific work of literary production.\u201dFootnote52\n\nWoolf\u2019s skeptical attitude towards the function of the literary establishment, which to a large extent determines the relationship between texts, authors, and readers, forms an important part of her larger institutional critique. She is particularly disparaging in her evaluation of the British reading public\u2019s attachment to norms, expectations, and habitual practices. She declares it \u201ca very suggestible and docile creature,\u201d which often persists in supporting commonly held notions. In her view, the public generally wants books to confirm their own view of the world, without much defiance:\n\n[o]ld women have houses. They have fathers. They have incomes. They have hot-water bottles. This is how we know that they are old women. Mr Wells and Mr Bennett and Mr Galsworthy have always taught us that this is the way to recognise them.Footnote53\n\nA relationship of this kind conducted on the basis of supply and demand principles, for Woolf, \u201cceases to be a means of communication between writer and reader, and becomes instead an obstacle and an impediment.\u201dFootnote54 This misconception of the novel\u2019s function underscores its implied cooperation with the maintenance of established social standards in the context of patriarchal capitalist modernity. As Victoria Baena argues, through a reading of Walter Benjamin\u2019s 1934 essay \u201cThe Author as a Producer,\u201d the \u201crole of the intellectual\u201d should be understood \u201cless in terms of political \u2018commitment\u2019 than as the writer of works that change or at least challenge the world\u201d \u2013 an apt description of Woolf\u2019s statement of intent in her debut novel and a lens through which to read her subsequent experiments with literary work in all its guises, as a form of feminist social criticism.Footnote55\nAfter the church scene, Rachel begins to fade away from the narrative. Her status as a protagonist is repeatedly disrupted and diminished instead of asserted and expanded; until, finally, her death is reduced to a conversation topic after tea. Even when she accepts Terence\u2019s offer of marriage during their visit to an Indigenous village, she is not really a person with a mind of her own, and only echoes the sentiments he offers her, adhering to social protocol.\n\n\u201cYou like being with me?\u201d Terence asked. \u201cYes, with you,\u201d she replied. [\u2009\u2026\u2009] \u201cWe are happy together.\u201d He did not seem to be speaking, or she to be hearing. \u201cVery happy,\u201d she answered. [\u2009\u2026\u2009] \u201cWe love each other,\u201d Terence said. \u201cWe love each other,\u201d she repeated. (316)\n\nRachel\u2019s position in the novel becomes further obscured as other characters start relating to her as Terence\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, following the announcement of the engagement. Their previous caution towards her is quickly overcome by her identification as a social presence they can recognize. While returning \u201cThank You\u201d notes she thinks it strange that \u201cconsidering how very different these people were, [\u2009\u2026\u2009] they used almost the same sentences when they wrote to congratulate her upon her engagement\u201d (342). Shortly after this, Rachel\u2019s fever overcomes her and she slips out of consciousness.Footnote56 This is the final act of dispossession the novel performs. The form of personhood available to her as a married woman obstructs all other possible accounts she might have wished to draw for herself. Even though Rachel agrees to become Terence\u2019s wife, the norms which govern this decision are not hers to make but are hers to comply with. As Butler asserts,\none invariably struggles with conditions of one\u2019s own life that one could not have chosen. If there is an operation of agency or, indeed, freedom in this struggle, it takes place in the context of an enabling and limiting field of constraint.\n\nBy allowing Rachel to break out of the characterization model allocated for women in the Bildungsroman, Woolf undermines the exercise of choice as an expression of agency, and with that the entire foundation on which the \u201cidealized representation of [the] autonomous male subject\u201d rests.Footnote58 Rachel\u2019s disrupted narrative shows that under conditions of patriarchal oppression, the self-determination narrative, mapped out across various points of recognition, becomes another form of control.\nConclusion\nIn theoretical terms, literary character has almost exclusively been discussed as a universal concept, nearly an ideal, akin to that of the autonomous Kantian subject, and in many ways designed to replicate it. Its failures and successes are decided by the same measure. It is often encumbered by expectations of accuracy, truthfulness, and relatability, which all combine to curate a reading process organized around the principle of recognition, both as an aesthetic and political construct. Woolf, however, saw this as a rather restrictive convention and made her opposition to it the cornerstone of her critical engagement with modern fiction. One of the reasons she questioned recognition-based principles for the construction and reading of fiction was connected to a concern about the potential of this convention to narrow the field of authorial invention and thus obscure the novel\u2019s ability to respond to changing social realities. Another, was a more broadly political one, connected to the representation of women in fiction. Woolf worried that a recognition-based model for the construction of personhood, can be used to support a binary world of power and gender relations, where norms are used to control the formation and expressions of identity and the ways in which they can be legitimized. Woolf\u2019s interest in this project, initiated in her first novel and continued throughout her writing life, is not confined to simply decoding the restrictive and implicit dangers of relying on such models in fiction as well as in life. Her first novel begins the work of proposing a new code of practice that would support more diverse forms of personhood and engender the formation of novel and emancipatory forms of political life. In this project the purpose of the novelist appears to be nothing short of imagining personhood anew, of learning to re-cognize it, and deliver it from the confines of its traditional forms.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The writing style and tone of these paragraphs suggest a sophisticated and scholarly approach to the topic at hand.

It argues that her dissatisfaction with traditional modes of women\u2019s characterization stems from their reliance on recognizable patriarchal models of personhood, an unhealthy dependence which restricts the development of new forms of gendered political and personal identification. This reading uses the concept of recognition, as understood in the post-Hegelian feminist tradition, as a key structuring and interpretative tool to demonstrate Woolf\u2019s early critical insight into the fraught relationship between idealized narratives of individual autonomy and gender. In doing so, it makes a case for the broader inclusion of recognition as a critical term of inquiry in modernist studies, both as an aesthetic and political site of contention.\n\n\nIntroduction\nVirginia Woolf\u2019s contemporaries often highlight characterization as a flaw in her writing practice. This common critical trope accompanies the publications of all her novels, starting with the very first, The Voyage Out (1915). An unsigned review in the Nation, for example, declares it \u201chardly a work of art. Partly because of its form, partly because it is too passionately intent upon vivisection.\u201d Despite offering generous praise for the execution of nearly every other aspect of the text, E. M. Forster finds that the \u201ccharacters are not vivid. [\u2009\u2026\u2009] they do not stroll out of their sentences, and even develop a tendency to merge shadow-like.\u201dWoolf\u2019s reactions to such comments were initially confined to her diaries and personal correspondence and ranged from frustration to acquiescence. Towards the end of the 1910s and early 1920s, however, they began to take a more distinct and public shape as a loose theory of modern fiction, developed in celebrated essays such as \u201cModern Novels\u201d (1919), \u201cReading\u201d (1919), \u201cMr Bennett and Mrs Brown\u201d (1923/4), and \u201cCharacter in Fiction\u201d (1924).Footnote3\n\nThe clamor of voices decrying the insufficiencies of modernist characters was a common feature in the critical landscape of the day, particularly when discussing novels of development and education, like The Voyage Out. As Jed Esty argues modernists often tried to circumvent the Bildungsroman\u2019s \u201cgeneric dictates or to revise them out of recognition.\u201dFootnote4 As a result, their modifications of the traditional developmental trajectories followed by its protagonists, associated with a process of learning and successful adaptation to social norms, tend to \u201cblock or defer the attainment of a mature social role.\u201dFootnote5 For Esty, Woolf\u2019s novel accomplishes just such an intervention through the workings of its plot and setting, which position its characters firmly within the histories of colonial contact, displacement, and migration.Footnote6 Susan Stanford Friedman also focuses on the text\u2019s challenges to the \u201corthodoxies of representation\u201d and its defiance of the \u201cboundaries of expectation as these have been erected by literary tradition.\u201dFootnote7 This reading concentrates explicitly on the function of women in the successful execution of the marriage plot and raises important questions about the role of gender in conventionally constructed narratives of development. The category of the \u201cfemale Bildungsroman,\u201d under which The Voyage Out was classified by early critics, has been in feminist critical parlance since at least the 1970s, chiefly occupying itself with investigating how women writers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries represented \u201cthe suppression and defeat of female autonomy, creativity, and maturity by patriarchal gender norms.\u201dFootnote8 In their well-known study in this tradition, Elizabeth Abel, Marianne Hirsch, and Elizabeth Langland, argue that the traditional Bildungsroman excludes gender \u201cas a pertinent category,\u201d an omission that has had direct effects on the dominant models for its \u201cnarrative structure,\u201d \u201cpsychology,\u201d and \u201crepresentation of social pressures.\u201dFootnote9 What is more, reading the history of the Bildungsroman as a document of the development of modern subjectivity, \u201cone could be tempted to conclude that the gender of modernity is indeed male,\u201d an impression, which, as Rita Felski states, calls for a sustained critique of the \u201cidealized representation of the autonomous male subject.\u201dFootnote10\n\nAs I will argue in what follows, Woolf\u2019s first novel engages in performing precisely this task and in doing so exhibits the development of a related interest in Woolf\u2019s thought. That is, the representation of women in fiction as a political problem, which is brought to bear on the aesthetic strategies of character construction and the hermeneutic practices employed to interpret them. Consequently, this article places emphasis on character, rather than plot formation, in order to bring to light Woolf\u2019s early insight into the regulatory power of reading norms. While the Bildungsroman plot in The Voyage Out allows Woolf to formulate a direct challenge to the narrative of development, as it relates to women\u2019s lives, her concerns go beyond a criticism of the limited social positions they are allowed to occupy.Footnote11 Directing her critical focus towards traditional models of characterization, heavily underwritten by the ideal of self-determination, shows that she identifies the very construction of the subject, in and through the normative conditions of power relations that shape our experiences as gendered and embodied agents, as a site of contention, anticipating much contemporary feminist theory on the topic. Furthermore, it lays the foundation of her critique of institutionalism and the forms of knowledge it engenders and propagates, which she elaborates more completely through her essays and novels of the 1920s and 1930s. As stated by Stephanie J. Brown in a recent essay, feminist approaches to Woolf\u2019s writing have been successful in instilling the importance of attending carefully to her \u201cgrowing conviction that existing institutions are structured by an ineradicably patriarchal logic, and therefore inadequate to the needs of women and to the requirements of a just society.\u201dFootnote12 Elucidating the ways in which Woolf sees this inadequacy as functioning through the narrative and hermeneutic norms which govern the literary representations of personhood, is the main objective of this article.\n\nTo begin this discussion, I would like to return to the term \u201crecognition,\u201d used in passing by Esty. Despite playing an important role within larger histories of ideas associated with personal autonomy and democratic social organization, the concept of recognition has been insufficiently developed in literary studies, as Felski has recently observed.Footnote13 Some consideration of recognition has taken place, mainly as a principle of poetics, derived from the Aristotelian notion of anagnorisis, which is generally understood to signify a moment of transition from ignorance to knowledge.Footnote14 These reflections have largely taken place within a framework of realist forms of representation, which tend to rely on a narrative logic of an inevitable revelation of purpose and meaning, a feature very much in operation within the Bildugnsroman, and one, which, as outlined above, the modernist novel of this kind tends to undermine. Hence, recognition in this sense, despite its customary operation as a principle of identity construction, has been deemed largely immaterial for modernist criticism in general, and feminist modernist criticism in particular. The larger political point encoded within the problem of recognition as an organizational device in fiction, which often evades detection, is brought into focus by Woolf\u2019s narrative of her young protagonist, Rachel Vinrace, who undertakes the task of becoming a socially recognizable individual within the context of a patriarchal economy of knowledge.Footnote15 The novel stages Rachel\u2019s engagement as the culmination of this educational process, the narrative and hermeneutic end of the literary imagination, followed by the young heroine\u2019s death. In a sense, this is the highest form anagnorisis can attain and its ultimate limitation \u2013 fiction constructed on this model, cannot see beyond that which is knowable, or even that which is known. As Ben Parker observes, it is at the point that the Aristotelian notion begins to acquire Hegelian echoes. \u201cThe logic of recognition,\u201d he writes, \u201cpresumes an ultimate knowability: the truth of subjectivity requires a detour though otherness,\u201d a detour obstructed under the conditions of capitalist modernity and the norms of identity development it espouses.Footnote16\n\nContemporary political theories of recognition also trace back to Hegel. His concept of Anerkennung as developed in the Phenomenology of Spirit (1807) is concerned with the constitution of knowing subjects, which he sees not as an isolated activity, but one which must be performed in communion with others: \u201c[s]elf-consciousness exists in and for itself when, and by the fact that, it so exists for another self-another; that is, it exists only in being acknowledged.\u201dFootnote17 This process upholds for Hegel the infinite nature of this two-fold exchange in dialectical opposition to the determinateness of self-consciousness. In other words, the subject has to be recognized by others and have its claims to personhood validated through intersubjective acknowledgement within the social sphere in order to escape the laws of its own determination. This also leads to establishing an autonomous sense of self and the creation of ethical obligations for the treatment of others. However, receiving and granting recognition under conditions of social inequality raises questions about the hierarchies of value generated by this exchange. Feminist philosophers continue to dispute the usefulness of recognition as a formative principle for democratic social structures, within which women can find emancipation. A significant voice in these debates is Judith Butler, whose concerns regarding the concept and its relationship to oppression are deep and persistent, as further discussion below will demonstrate. The benefits of reading Woolf in tandem with Butler have been brought into sharp focus by Elsa H\u00f6gberg, who examines the practice of recognition as an ethical counterpart to the problem of violence in the work of both authors. While H\u00f6gberg\u2019s study focuses on the interwar novels, from Jacob\u2019s Room (1922) to The Waves (1931), my analysis locates Woolf\u2019s interest in constructing new \u201caesthetic strategies for reconfiguring individuality\u201d at an even earlier moment, in her debut novel.Footnote18 It also explicitly takes up these strategies\u2019 gendered dimensions, focalized in The Voyage Out through Rachel\u2019s course of development towards acquiring a recognizable form of personhood in keeping with the limitations imposed by her social position as a young woman.\n\nStriving for recognition\nJudith Butler understands recognition as an essential aspect both of self-formation and interpersonal relations, part of a reciprocal communal exchange, for which \u201cwe are all, in different ways, striving.\u201dFootnote19 This is to say that recognition is a common human condition, a token of validation we require to affirm our existence as functioning agents within the social sphere. This fundamental reliance, for Butler, engenders certain dependencies which make us vulnerable to others as well as to the very norms that govern our relations with the wider world. In The Psychic Life of Power, she outlines this situation as one of \u201cprimary dependency [which] conditions the political formation and regulation of the subject and becomes the means of their subjection.\u201dFootnote20 The subject then is \u201cformed in submission\u201d to power \u201cthat at first appears as external, pressed upon the subject,\u201d but in \u201cpressing the subject into subordination, assumes a psychic form that constitutes the subject\u2019s self-identity.\u201dFootnote21 This relationship within which personhood is born, is one that \u201cinitiates and sustains our agency\u201d but also restricts and controls it.Footnote22 The concept of recognition, on this account, becomes implicated in practices of control, prevalent within the paradigmatic structure of power relations that shape the individual within a patriarchal context. Despite its subordinating power, however, recognition continues to be a necessary process due to our psychic and social need for it. In Butler\u2019s view, the subject in the process of self-formation either has to accept this form of subordinating relations or forgo participation in social life altogether. Both options prove undesirable, in different ways, harboring the illusion of a meaningful choice. The resistance strategy she offers is framed through a process of re-signification of the terms and practices individuals utilize to counter the prevalent logic of subjection such as forms of \u201ccritical desubjectivation\u201d and \u201cincoherence of identity.\u201dFootnote23\n\nWoolf\u2019s position, as it emerges in The Voyage Out itself and later essays carries more ambiguity. In the first instance, she situates recognition within the reading process, as a tool of characterization, and acknowledges its instrumental function for engendering a productive connection between writer, reader, and text. In \u201cCharacter in Fiction,\u201d she states that\n\n[t]he writer must get into touch with his reader by putting before him something which he recognises, which therefore stimulates his imagination, and makes him co-operate in the far more difficult business of intimacy. And it is of the highest importance that this common meeting-place should be reached easily, almost instinctively, in the dark, with one\u2019s eyes shut.Footnote24\n\nA shared experience emerges from this state of being in common with others. Establishing this intersubjective \u201cmeeting-place\u201d relies on a relationship of recognition between the reader and the forms of personhood they encounter in the text. When left to work in peace, the norms of judgement determine the types of fictional representation that can be recognized as characteristic of personhood. When they are meddled with, the entire socio-epistemological functioning of the reading process is endangered. The difficulty Woolf identifies for the writer is that the construction of a common space around a practice of recognition can constrain the emergence of new forms of identification, as well as the author\u2019s aesthetic field of experimentation. This complication, also formulated by Butler, arises through the demand to give an account of oneself, or to become legible, within the social sphere. In doing this, the subject is confronted with the exchange of their singularity for a measure of recognizability. \u201cIf I try to give an account of myself,\u201d she states:\nif I try to make myself recognizable and understandable [\u2009\u2026\u2009] I will, to some degree, have to make myself substitutable in order to make myself recognizable. The narrative authority of the \u201cI\u201d must give way to the perspective and temporality of a set of norms that contest the singularity of my own story.Footnote25\n\nIn The Voyage Out, Rachel comes to experience this demand directly on several occasions, usually when asked to introduce herself. During an outing, St John Hirst, one of her companions, proposes that each member of their party should provide \u201ca short biographical sketch.\u201dFootnote26 In response, Rachel states that she is \u201ctwenty-four years of age, the daughter of a ship-owner, that she had never been properly educated; played the piano, had no brothers or sisters, and lived at Richmond with her aunts, her mother being dead\u201d (159). This matter-of-fact description is only comparable in substance to the Who\u2019s Who compendium of short biographies of famous historical figures Rachel reads on board her father\u2019s ship, which takes her to the fictional colonial location of Santa Marina, where most of the novel\u2019s action takes place.Footnote27 She issues this string of facts, referring to her age, class, educational status, family history, and her sole occupation efficiently and impersonally, as if in fear or under duress, each comma marking yet another aspect of her social personhood. She presents herself as a common, not a singular being, one of many, her identity not porous, but impermeable, forged under the pressure of the unforgivable inevitability of norms.\nTerence Hewet, an aspiring novelist, and Rachel\u2019s future fianc\u00e9e, also challenges her to give an account of herself. At Terence\u2019s prompt, \u201cRachel,\u201d the narrator states, \u201clost her freedom and became self-conscious. She felt herself at once singular and under observation\u201d (245). For Felski, this would constitute a moment of recognition, which, unlike Butler, she sees as a potentially generative experience. When we engage in a process of recognition, she writes, \u201cwe make sense of what is unfamiliar by fitting it into an existing scheme, linking it to what we already know.\u201dFootnote28 But this initial connection with the norms we recognize does not have to produce an experience that is repetitive, derivative, or in any way subordinating. Instead, it could show us things in a new light, compelling us to imagine a \u201crevised or altered sense of who I am.\u201dFootnote29 On her reading, the self-conscious moment can simultaneously serve \u201cas a social diagnosis and an ethical judgement.\u201dFootnote30 As a result, she advocates preserving a certain epistemological openness, which harbors the potential to create new forms of self-knowledge that can be taken up by the subject through a phenomenological relation of \u201cself-scrutiny rather than self-loss.\u201dFootnote31\n\nThe startling experience of self-consciousness, provoked in Rachel by Terence\u2019s demand, however, is presented by Woolf as inimical to her freedom. Overwhelmed by the demands of recognition, the self-realization that she must become intelligible as a subject of norms threatens her capacity for generating self-knowledge. The realization that he sees her as a woman additionally inhibits Rachel\u2019s ability to communicate an individual position. Furthermore, she feels constrained and \u201champered,\u201d the necessity of self-scrutiny only revealing more loss of possibility (246\u20137). In this moment of self-consciousness Rachel comprehends her dependence on Terence and her own vulnerability, exposing Woolf\u2019s own critique of recognition predicated on the certainty of knowledge as model of emancipation. Instead, Rachel\u2019s freedom is diminished, she becomes an object of enquiry, of knowledge, and of desire, which can be mastered and acquired by others.Footnote32 Once she perceives her newly drawn outline produced through Terence\u2019s recognition of her womanhood, she is compelled to inhabit it by modifying or relinquishing other fragments of her identity. In this way, the norm prevails, forcing an act of dispossession.Footnote33 Louise DeSalvo draws attention to the differences between the first English edition of the novel and the first American one, published five years later, at this crucial moment in the development of the relationship between Rachel and Terence. The American edition, DeSalvo observes, offers a more combative Rachel, who refuses to be \u201cpinned down by any second person,\u201d which demonstrates Woolf\u2019s heightened attention to emphasizing the disbalance in the hermeneutic positions which Rachel and Terence occupy in this exchange.Footnote34 Rachel never demands a reciprocal account from Terence, allowing him the possibility to escape self-scrutiny and categorization. The novel purposefully refuses to represent this exchange between the two lovers as reciprocal and equal, a point which serves to complicate models of analysing ethical readings of recognition as \u201cdyadic encounters,\u201d which tend to equalize the power both agents hold in the validation of one another.Footnote35 In the context of a social infrastructure built upon networks of patriarchal power, Woolf seems to be suggesting, the position of women in this exercise, is one of deep disadvantage. In this sense, the common meeting place becomes less of a democratic locus for reinvention and more of a battleground for survival.\n\nBecoming a person\nEarly in the novel, Rachel is described as someone who is struggling to become a person. The prime impediments to this are associated with her ability to adequately employ her rational faculties, accumulate knowledge, and exercise command over her language. \u201cA hesitation in speaking,\u201d the narrator observes, \u201cor rather a tendency to use the wrong words, made her seem more than normally incompetent for her years\u201d (15\u201316). Further on we are told that \u201cher eyes were unreflecting as water\u201d and \u201cher mind was absent\u201d (17). As Allison Pease notes, this is not an unusual representation of womanhood in early twentieth-century literature. Rachel \u201chas failed the qualifications of post-Cartesian selfhood,\u201d she \u201cknows nothing; she thinks and feels, but she is an outsider to a system that produces knowing individuals.\u201dFootnote36 The inability to find the words to express her thoughts is a source of confusion both for Rachel herself and the people around her. Her preference for musical over literary forms of expression, reflective of her discomfort with explicit verbal identifications, is evident throughout the text. As a result, Rachel is seen as someone who is not possessed of the ability to generate rational certainty, making this one of the main issues in terms of her characterization. Emma Sutton connects this to her \u201cinarticulateness\u201d and the difficulties of expressing the intense richness of inner thought through the limited commands of spoken language.Footnote37 Molly Hite goes even further to suggest that in favoring \u201can inherently nonrepresentational\u201d art of expression for Rachel, Woolf curates \u201can aesthetic form that invents rather than represents.\u201dFootnote38 Music creates modalities of connection and identification that are non-structural and non-hierarchical, and allow Rachel to give full expression to the complexities of her interiority without having to negotiate the struggle for recognition.\n\nIn a novel, whose characters\u2019 chief occupation, as Eric Sandberg observes, is \u201cdefining, or characterizing, other people,\u201d Rachel\u2019s lack of clear outline presents a puzzle.Footnote39 In addition to failing the Cartesian principles of selfhood, rooted in rational self-examination, she seems to lack awareness of the gendered aspects of socialization. Mrs Helen Ambrose, her aunt, functions as a figure of female authority, whose role is to induct Rachel in traditional practices of womanhood, including those associated with motherhood and marriage. She takes it upon herself to \u201cenlighten\u201d (105) the young woman, whose sheltered upbringing by her two (unmarried) aunts, following the death of her mother, according to Helen, is the reason why she appears so removed from worldly interpersonal affairs, especially those associated with sexual desire. Rachel\u2019s encounter with Mr Dalloway on the ship to Santa Marina, provides a brief and unwelcome disclosure in this regard. During one of their brief conversations, he prompts: \u201c\u2018[\u2009\u2026\u2009] Now tell me about yourself. What are your interests and occupations?\u2019\u201d Rachel responds: \u201c\u2018You see, I\u2019m a woman\u2019\u201d (79).Footnote40 Her admission is met with an outburst of passion, which moves Mr Dalloway to assault her with a kiss, following which he misdirects responsibility for the violent act and accuses her of temptation. The direct second-person address, \u201c\u2018You tempt me,\u2019\u201d summons an act of individual agency Rachel is unable to account for (80). Her resulting feelings range from discomfort to fear, she is unable to sleep and stop thinking about the experience, feeling persecuted and entrapped. She confides in Helen, who simply explains that this is the way things are between men and women: \u201cit\u2019s the most natural thing in the world\u201d (86). This leads Rachel to formulate a link between herself and \u201cthose women in Piccadilly,\u201d who her aunt confirms are prostitutes (86). As Hite emphasizes, \u201cthe existence and meaning of the prostitute are of acute importance to a young girl entering the arena of sexual arrangements.\u201dFootnote41 The topic emerges again in a discussion with Evelyn Murgatroyd, another character in the novel, who is trying to navigate her marriage prospects, when it is explicitly linked to the economic foundations of marriage, understood as a \u201crelation of sexual ownership.\u201dFootnote42 The process of becoming a person recognizable by others for Rachel, as for Evelyn, and the rest of the women in the novel, is inevitably tied with negotiating the terms on which their bodies will be interpreted, valued, and possessed. The moment of confrontation with patriarchal sexuality leads Rachel to see \u201cher life for the first time [as] a creeping hedged-in thing, driven cautiously between high walls, here turned aside, there plunged in darkness, made dull and crippled forever\u201d (87). She suddenly starts to understand how gendered expectations restrict and direct behavior. This emerging sense of limitation foregrounds the conflict between the normative rituals associated with Rachel\u2019s \u201cculturally determined destiny\u201d as a wife and mother, as Christine Froula has argued, and her desire to \u201cbreak out of the female initiation plot that her culture imposes upon women, constituting them not as fully legitimated participants in history and culture.\u201dFootnote43 Woolf\u2019s concerns with this process of legitimation are linked to the institutional hierarchies that create disparities between those who can claim to be possessors of the means of knowledge production and those who can only acquire the resulting outcomes, a distinction which radically alters the balance of power in the practice of recognition.\n\nThe Voyage Out interrogates the role literature and practices of reading play in the establishments of these hierarchies, particularly as they relate to the education of women. As Friedman observes, \u201cthe reading of people\u201d and \u201cthe reading of books\u201d in the novel are often presented as binary opposites \u2013 the former related to the social sphere, and generally the domain of women and the latter, linked to the institutional production of knowledge, and thus reserved for men.Footnote44 The politics of reading was a topic that clearly occupied Woolf during the extended composition period of the novel, stretching from 1908 to 1913, during which she completed several essays on the topic.Footnote45 In the novel itself, Rachel receives instruction on her reading by various male characters, including Richard Dalloway, St John Hirst and her uncle, Ridley Ambrose. Mr Dalloway suggests Burke\u2019s writings on the American and French revolutions to induce a development of a political conscience. St John recommends Gibbon\u2019s multivolume history of the Roman empire as a way to test the viability of her mind. Mr Ambrose offers a course of learning based on the contents of his travel library that stretches from Balzac back to Marlowe.Footnote46 In his study, she is allowed to select her own reading and leaves with Le Cousine Bette (1846), a novel which displays women\u2019s insubordinate behavior as a persistent threat to the bourgeois stability of the family unit.\n\nAs the narrative develops, it is through the study and performance of literary characters that Rachel begins to take a more definite shape:\n\n\u201cWhat I want to know,\u201d she said aloud, \u201cis this: What is the truth? What is the truth of it all?\u201d She was speaking partly as herself and partly as the heroine of the play she had just read. [\u2009\u2026\u2009] for the moment she herself was the most vivid thing in it \u2013 a heroic statue in the middle of the foreground, dominating the view. Ibsen\u2019s plays always left her in that condition. She acted them for days at a time, greatly to Helen\u2019s amusement; and then it would be Meredith\u2019s turn and she became Diana of the Crossways, but Helen was aware that it was not all acting, and that some sort of change was taking place in the human being. (136\u20137)\n\nRachel\u2019s selection of texts focuses on the stories of modern women who inhabit a hostile world and commit various transgressive acts to free themselves from the confines associated with their gender identity.Footnote47 Her choices also reflect a forming idea of social inequality as Ibsen is followed \u201cby a novel such as Mrs Ambrose detested, whose purpose was to distribute the guilt of a woman\u2019s downfall upon the right shoulders\u201d (138). In addition to providing her with examples of womanhood, modern fiction also offers a space for experimentation with language. She reads the shiny, yellow-covered books \u201cwith the curious literalness of one to whom written sentences are unfamiliar, and handling words as though they were made of wood, separately of great importance, and possessed of shapes like tables and chairs\u201d (137\u20138). Rachel uses the language of literary representation to learn the normative shapes and sizes of modern human experience, and particularly that of women, aware that words carry the weight of the meanings ascribed to them. This experience of trying on fictional characters highlights the collaborative force with which language, norms, and forms come together to formulate the recognizable models of identification available to the modern reader.\nRachel\u2019s education and reading practice slowly create an archive of linguistic and behavioral codes to help her construct a picture of a coherent gendered personhood. As her performance within her social circle improves and reaches the expected standard, Mrs Ambrose directly gives her permission to be a person:\n\n\u201cSo now you can go ahead and be a person on your own account,\u201d she added. The vision of her own personality, of herself as a real everlasting thing, different from anything else, unmergeable, like the see or the wind, flashed in Rachel\u2019s mind, and she became profoundly excited at the thought of living. (90)\n\nRachel\u2019s jubilation at this prospect does not materialize in a conscious effort of making herself into a \u201creal everlasting thing\u201d; instead, she slides out of view at every chance of establishing herself, a practice encouraged by her eclectic reading. As Butler argues, the draw towards accounting for oneself as a singular subject, in search for social validation, is a crucial step in the practice of recognition, that inevitably comes to clash with the necessity to do so within a normative framework of social relations. Any such account will have to involve parts that do not belong to the subject, whether because they are linked with the norms that direct her own self-constitution or the norms that guide her expression and intelligibility. In this respect, Butler asserts, \u201cit is only in dispossession that I can and do give an account of myself.\u201dFootnote48 Having \u201clearned something about the social limits to her possibilities,\u201d in Hite\u2019s formulation, Rachel is shown to realize the constrained scope of agential action, determined by the gender norms associated with her self-development, within which she is allowed to operate.Footnote49 The novel also adapts to this disruption of the recognition arc and its \u201crepresentational strategies\u201d and begins to \u201cdefine her body more and more in terms of an observer\u2019s gaze,\u201d manifesting its awareness that \u201cthe knowledge of and entrance into the public realm involve endangering other kinds of knowledge and other realms of ontological contact.\u201dFootnote50\nEntering the public sphere\nFollowing her experience of self-consciousness triggered by the confrontation with Terence\u2019s demand, Rachel perceives that the shapes she can inhabit that can generate recognition in response are always already there, carved out of normative demands. The implied function of recognition as a regulation principle, which determines the forms of identity that can be legitimately adopted within the wider normative order, is exposed during the Sunday church service. Rachel looks at the faces she knows from luncheons, walks, and card games and for the first time regards them as fabricated. This realization triggers a process of Cartesian revelation, which makes her reject \u201call that she had implicitly believed\u201d (265). She is unsettled by her fellow travelers\u2019 need for validation, which makes them into \u201cslavishly acquiescent [\u2009\u2026\u2009] limpet[s],\u201d who allow themselves to be co-opted within a deeply suspect economy of exchange (265). Rachel\u2019s internal monologue shows her becoming critically aware of the norms of legibility which govern the social order in which she is expected to enlist. This is the closest the novel comes to articulating a scene of recognition in the traditional sense and it is significant that Rachel\u2019s transition from a position of relative inexperience to one of \u201cenlightenment\u201d occurs not as an act of self-reflection, but as one of public reading. In her previous encounters with the male characters who demand an account of herself, she has been evasive, impersonal, but never fully open or entirely paradigmatic as a participant in the economy of desire. Instinctively aware of the threat recognition carries for her own singularity, she is not prepared to be transparent to others, her presence in interpersonal exchanges being marked by a curious elusiveness and withholding of substance. Woolf\u2019s own elusiveness in terms of offering \u201cauthorial guidance\u201d functions not only through the presentation of \u201cconflicting tonal cues\u201d in relation to the reading of characters, but through her deliberate refusal to structure her narrative around the recognition coordinates expected of it.Footnote51 In this way, she also expands her critical examination from its initial focus on the normative links that are used to construct the novel as a form primary concerned with the representation of personhood, into the \u201cpolitical stakes of the specific work of literary production.\u201dFootnote52\n\nWoolf\u2019s skeptical attitude towards the function of the literary establishment, which to a large extent determines the relationship between texts, authors, and readers, forms an important part of her larger institutional critique. She is particularly disparaging in her evaluation of the British reading public\u2019s attachment to norms, expectations, and habitual practices. She declares it \u201ca very suggestible and docile creature,\u201d which often persists in supporting commonly held notions. In her view, the public generally wants books to confirm their own view of the world, without much defiance:\n\n[o]ld women have houses. They have fathers. They have incomes. They have hot-water bottles. This is how we know that they are old women. Mr Wells and Mr Bennett and Mr Galsworthy have always taught us that this is the way to recognise them.Footnote53\n\nA relationship of this kind conducted on the basis of supply and demand principles, for Woolf, \u201cceases to be a means of communication between writer and reader, and becomes instead an obstacle and an impediment.\u201dFootnote54 This misconception of the novel\u2019s function underscores its implied cooperation with the maintenance of established social standards in the context of patriarchal capitalist modernity. As Victoria Baena argues, through a reading of Walter Benjamin\u2019s 1934 essay \u201cThe Author as a Producer,\u201d the \u201crole of the intellectual\u201d should be understood \u201cless in terms of political \u2018commitment\u2019 than as the writer of works that change or at least challenge the world\u201d \u2013 an apt description of Woolf\u2019s statement of intent in her debut novel and a lens through which to read her subsequent experiments with literary work in all its guises, as a form of feminist social criticism.Footnote55\nAfter the church scene, Rachel begins to fade away from the narrative. Her status as a protagonist is repeatedly disrupted and diminished instead of asserted and expanded; until, finally, her death is reduced to a conversation topic after tea. Even when she accepts Terence\u2019s offer of marriage during their visit to an Indigenous village, she is not really a person with a mind of her own, and only echoes the sentiments he offers her, adhering to social protocol.\n\n\u201cYou like being with me?\u201d Terence asked. \u201cYes, with you,\u201d she replied. [\u2009\u2026\u2009] \u201cWe are happy together.\u201d He did not seem to be speaking, or she to be hearing. \u201cVery happy,\u201d she answered. [\u2009\u2026\u2009] \u201cWe love each other,\u201d Terence said. \u201cWe love each other,\u201d she repeated. (316)\n\nRachel\u2019s position in the novel becomes further obscured as other characters start relating to her as Terence\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, following the announcement of the engagement. Their previous caution towards her is quickly overcome by her identification as a social presence they can recognize. While returning \u201cThank You\u201d notes she thinks it strange that \u201cconsidering how very different these people were, [\u2009\u2026\u2009] they used almost the same sentences when they wrote to congratulate her upon her engagement\u201d (342). Shortly after this, Rachel\u2019s fever overcomes her and she slips out of consciousness.Footnote56 This is the final act of dispossession the novel performs. The form of personhood available to her as a married woman obstructs all other possible accounts she might have wished to draw for herself. Even though Rachel agrees to become Terence\u2019s wife, the norms which govern this decision are not hers to make but are hers to comply with. As Butler asserts,\none invariably struggles with conditions of one\u2019s own life that one could not have chosen. If there is an operation of agency or, indeed, freedom in this struggle, it takes place in the context of an enabling and limiting field of constraint.\n\nBy allowing Rachel to break out of the characterization model allocated for women in the Bildungsroman, Woolf undermines the exercise of choice as an expression of agency, and with that the entire foundation on which the \u201cidealized representation of [the] autonomous male subject\u201d rests.Footnote58 Rachel\u2019s disrupted narrative shows that under conditions of patriarchal oppression, the self-determination narrative, mapped out across various points of recognition, becomes another form of control.\nConclusion\nIn theoretical terms, literary character has almost exclusively been discussed as a universal concept, nearly an ideal, akin to that of the autonomous Kantian subject, and in many ways designed to replicate it. Its failures and successes are decided by the same measure. It is often encumbered by expectations of accuracy, truthfulness, and relatability, which all combine to curate a reading process organized around the principle of recognition, both as an aesthetic and political construct. Woolf, however, saw this as a rather restrictive convention and made her opposition to it the cornerstone of her critical engagement with modern fiction. One of the reasons she questioned recognition-based principles for the construction and reading of fiction was connected to a concern about the potential of this convention to narrow the field of authorial invention and thus obscure the novel\u2019s ability to respond to changing social realities. Another, was a more broadly political one, connected to the representation of women in fiction. Woolf worried that a recognition-based model for the construction of personhood, can be used to support a binary world of power and gender relations, where norms are used to control the formation and expressions of identity and the ways in which they can be legitimized. Woolf\u2019s interest in this project, initiated in her first novel and continued throughout her writing life, is not confined to simply decoding the restrictive and implicit dangers of relying on such models in fiction as well as in life. Her first novel begins the work of proposing a new code of practice that would support more diverse forms of personhood and engender the formation of novel and emancipatory forms of political life. In this project the purpose of the novelist appears to be nothing short of imagining personhood anew, of learning to re-cognize it, and deliver it from the confines of its traditional forms.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The writing style and tone in the given paragraphs are academic, formal, and analytical.

It argues that her dissatisfaction with traditional modes of women\u2019s characterization stems from their reliance on recognizable patriarchal models of personhood, an unhealthy dependence which restricts the development of new forms of gendered political and personal identification. This reading uses the concept of recognition, as understood in the post-Hegelian feminist tradition, as a key structuring and interpretative tool to demonstrate Woolf\u2019s early critical insight into the fraught relationship between idealized narratives of individual autonomy and gender. In doing so, it makes a case for the broader inclusion of recognition as a critical term of inquiry in modernist studies, both as an aesthetic and political site of contention.\n\n\nIntroduction\nVirginia Woolf\u2019s contemporaries often highlight characterization as a flaw in her writing practice. This common critical trope accompanies the publications of all her novels, starting with the very first, The Voyage Out (1915). An unsigned review in the Nation, for example, declares it \u201chardly a work of art. Partly because of its form, partly because it is too passionately intent upon vivisection.\u201d Despite offering generous praise for the execution of nearly every other aspect of the text, E. M. Forster finds that the \u201ccharacters are not vivid. [\u2009\u2026\u2009] they do not stroll out of their sentences, and even develop a tendency to merge shadow-like.\u201dWoolf\u2019s reactions to such comments were initially confined to her diaries and personal correspondence and ranged from frustration to acquiescence. Towards the end of the 1910s and early 1920s, however, they began to take a more distinct and public shape as a loose theory of modern fiction, developed in celebrated essays such as \u201cModern Novels\u201d (1919), \u201cReading\u201d (1919), \u201cMr Bennett and Mrs Brown\u201d (1923/4), and \u201cCharacter in Fiction\u201d (1924).Footnote3\n\nThe clamor of voices decrying the insufficiencies of modernist characters was a common feature in the critical landscape of the day, particularly when discussing novels of development and education, like The Voyage Out. As Jed Esty argues modernists often tried to circumvent the Bildungsroman\u2019s \u201cgeneric dictates or to revise them out of recognition.\u201dFootnote4 As a result, their modifications of the traditional developmental trajectories followed by its protagonists, associated with a process of learning and successful adaptation to social norms, tend to \u201cblock or defer the attainment of a mature social role.\u201dFootnote5 For Esty, Woolf\u2019s novel accomplishes just such an intervention through the workings of its plot and setting, which position its characters firmly within the histories of colonial contact, displacement, and migration.Footnote6 Susan Stanford Friedman also focuses on the text\u2019s challenges to the \u201corthodoxies of representation\u201d and its defiance of the \u201cboundaries of expectation as these have been erected by literary tradition.\u201dFootnote7 This reading concentrates explicitly on the function of women in the successful execution of the marriage plot and raises important questions about the role of gender in conventionally constructed narratives of development. The category of the \u201cfemale Bildungsroman,\u201d under which The Voyage Out was classified by early critics, has been in feminist critical parlance since at least the 1970s, chiefly occupying itself with investigating how women writers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries represented \u201cthe suppression and defeat of female autonomy, creativity, and maturity by patriarchal gender norms.\u201dFootnote8 In their well-known study in this tradition, Elizabeth Abel, Marianne Hirsch, and Elizabeth Langland, argue that the traditional Bildungsroman excludes gender \u201cas a pertinent category,\u201d an omission that has had direct effects on the dominant models for its \u201cnarrative structure,\u201d \u201cpsychology,\u201d and \u201crepresentation of social pressures.\u201dFootnote9 What is more, reading the history of the Bildungsroman as a document of the development of modern subjectivity, \u201cone could be tempted to conclude that the gender of modernity is indeed male,\u201d an impression, which, as Rita Felski states, calls for a sustained critique of the \u201cidealized representation of the autonomous male subject.\u201dFootnote10\n\nAs I will argue in what follows, Woolf\u2019s first novel engages in performing precisely this task and in doing so exhibits the development of a related interest in Woolf\u2019s thought. That is, the representation of women in fiction as a political problem, which is brought to bear on the aesthetic strategies of character construction and the hermeneutic practices employed to interpret them. Consequently, this article places emphasis on character, rather than plot formation, in order to bring to light Woolf\u2019s early insight into the regulatory power of reading norms. While the Bildungsroman plot in The Voyage Out allows Woolf to formulate a direct challenge to the narrative of development, as it relates to women\u2019s lives, her concerns go beyond a criticism of the limited social positions they are allowed to occupy.Footnote11 Directing her critical focus towards traditional models of characterization, heavily underwritten by the ideal of self-determination, shows that she identifies the very construction of the subject, in and through the normative conditions of power relations that shape our experiences as gendered and embodied agents, as a site of contention, anticipating much contemporary feminist theory on the topic. Furthermore, it lays the foundation of her critique of institutionalism and the forms of knowledge it engenders and propagates, which she elaborates more completely through her essays and novels of the 1920s and 1930s. As stated by Stephanie J. Brown in a recent essay, feminist approaches to Woolf\u2019s writing have been successful in instilling the importance of attending carefully to her \u201cgrowing conviction that existing institutions are structured by an ineradicably patriarchal logic, and therefore inadequate to the needs of women and to the requirements of a just society.\u201dFootnote12 Elucidating the ways in which Woolf sees this inadequacy as functioning through the narrative and hermeneutic norms which govern the literary representations of personhood, is the main objective of this article.\n\nTo begin this discussion, I would like to return to the term \u201crecognition,\u201d used in passing by Esty. Despite playing an important role within larger histories of ideas associated with personal autonomy and democratic social organization, the concept of recognition has been insufficiently developed in literary studies, as Felski has recently observed.Footnote13 Some consideration of recognition has taken place, mainly as a principle of poetics, derived from the Aristotelian notion of anagnorisis, which is generally understood to signify a moment of transition from ignorance to knowledge.Footnote14 These reflections have largely taken place within a framework of realist forms of representation, which tend to rely on a narrative logic of an inevitable revelation of purpose and meaning, a feature very much in operation within the Bildugnsroman, and one, which, as outlined above, the modernist novel of this kind tends to undermine. Hence, recognition in this sense, despite its customary operation as a principle of identity construction, has been deemed largely immaterial for modernist criticism in general, and feminist modernist criticism in particular. The larger political point encoded within the problem of recognition as an organizational device in fiction, which often evades detection, is brought into focus by Woolf\u2019s narrative of her young protagonist, Rachel Vinrace, who undertakes the task of becoming a socially recognizable individual within the context of a patriarchal economy of knowledge.Footnote15 The novel stages Rachel\u2019s engagement as the culmination of this educational process, the narrative and hermeneutic end of the literary imagination, followed by the young heroine\u2019s death. In a sense, this is the highest form anagnorisis can attain and its ultimate limitation \u2013 fiction constructed on this model, cannot see beyond that which is knowable, or even that which is known. As Ben Parker observes, it is at the point that the Aristotelian notion begins to acquire Hegelian echoes. \u201cThe logic of recognition,\u201d he writes, \u201cpresumes an ultimate knowability: the truth of subjectivity requires a detour though otherness,\u201d a detour obstructed under the conditions of capitalist modernity and the norms of identity development it espouses.Footnote16\n\nContemporary political theories of recognition also trace back to Hegel. His concept of Anerkennung as developed in the Phenomenology of Spirit (1807) is concerned with the constitution of knowing subjects, which he sees not as an isolated activity, but one which must be performed in communion with others: \u201c[s]elf-consciousness exists in and for itself when, and by the fact that, it so exists for another self-another; that is, it exists only in being acknowledged.\u201dFootnote17 This process upholds for Hegel the infinite nature of this two-fold exchange in dialectical opposition to the determinateness of self-consciousness. In other words, the subject has to be recognized by others and have its claims to personhood validated through intersubjective acknowledgement within the social sphere in order to escape the laws of its own determination. This also leads to establishing an autonomous sense of self and the creation of ethical obligations for the treatment of others. However, receiving and granting recognition under conditions of social inequality raises questions about the hierarchies of value generated by this exchange. Feminist philosophers continue to dispute the usefulness of recognition as a formative principle for democratic social structures, within which women can find emancipation. A significant voice in these debates is Judith Butler, whose concerns regarding the concept and its relationship to oppression are deep and persistent, as further discussion below will demonstrate. The benefits of reading Woolf in tandem with Butler have been brought into sharp focus by Elsa H\u00f6gberg, who examines the practice of recognition as an ethical counterpart to the problem of violence in the work of both authors. While H\u00f6gberg\u2019s study focuses on the interwar novels, from Jacob\u2019s Room (1922) to The Waves (1931), my analysis locates Woolf\u2019s interest in constructing new \u201caesthetic strategies for reconfiguring individuality\u201d at an even earlier moment, in her debut novel.Footnote18 It also explicitly takes up these strategies\u2019 gendered dimensions, focalized in The Voyage Out through Rachel\u2019s course of development towards acquiring a recognizable form of personhood in keeping with the limitations imposed by her social position as a young woman.\n\nStriving for recognition\nJudith Butler understands recognition as an essential aspect both of self-formation and interpersonal relations, part of a reciprocal communal exchange, for which \u201cwe are all, in different ways, striving.\u201dFootnote19 This is to say that recognition is a common human condition, a token of validation we require to affirm our existence as functioning agents within the social sphere. This fundamental reliance, for Butler, engenders certain dependencies which make us vulnerable to others as well as to the very norms that govern our relations with the wider world. In The Psychic Life of Power, she outlines this situation as one of \u201cprimary dependency [which] conditions the political formation and regulation of the subject and becomes the means of their subjection.\u201dFootnote20 The subject then is \u201cformed in submission\u201d to power \u201cthat at first appears as external, pressed upon the subject,\u201d but in \u201cpressing the subject into subordination, assumes a psychic form that constitutes the subject\u2019s self-identity.\u201dFootnote21 This relationship within which personhood is born, is one that \u201cinitiates and sustains our agency\u201d but also restricts and controls it.Footnote22 The concept of recognition, on this account, becomes implicated in practices of control, prevalent within the paradigmatic structure of power relations that shape the individual within a patriarchal context. Despite its subordinating power, however, recognition continues to be a necessary process due to our psychic and social need for it. In Butler\u2019s view, the subject in the process of self-formation either has to accept this form of subordinating relations or forgo participation in social life altogether. Both options prove undesirable, in different ways, harboring the illusion of a meaningful choice. The resistance strategy she offers is framed through a process of re-signification of the terms and practices individuals utilize to counter the prevalent logic of subjection such as forms of \u201ccritical desubjectivation\u201d and \u201cincoherence of identity.\u201dFootnote23\n\nWoolf\u2019s position, as it emerges in The Voyage Out itself and later essays carries more ambiguity. In the first instance, she situates recognition within the reading process, as a tool of characterization, and acknowledges its instrumental function for engendering a productive connection between writer, reader, and text. In \u201cCharacter in Fiction,\u201d she states that\n\n[t]he writer must get into touch with his reader by putting before him something which he recognises, which therefore stimulates his imagination, and makes him co-operate in the far more difficult business of intimacy. And it is of the highest importance that this common meeting-place should be reached easily, almost instinctively, in the dark, with one\u2019s eyes shut.Footnote24\n\nA shared experience emerges from this state of being in common with others. Establishing this intersubjective \u201cmeeting-place\u201d relies on a relationship of recognition between the reader and the forms of personhood they encounter in the text. When left to work in peace, the norms of judgement determine the types of fictional representation that can be recognized as characteristic of personhood. When they are meddled with, the entire socio-epistemological functioning of the reading process is endangered. The difficulty Woolf identifies for the writer is that the construction of a common space around a practice of recognition can constrain the emergence of new forms of identification, as well as the author\u2019s aesthetic field of experimentation. This complication, also formulated by Butler, arises through the demand to give an account of oneself, or to become legible, within the social sphere. In doing this, the subject is confronted with the exchange of their singularity for a measure of recognizability. \u201cIf I try to give an account of myself,\u201d she states:\nif I try to make myself recognizable and understandable [\u2009\u2026\u2009] I will, to some degree, have to make myself substitutable in order to make myself recognizable. The narrative authority of the \u201cI\u201d must give way to the perspective and temporality of a set of norms that contest the singularity of my own story.Footnote25\n\nIn The Voyage Out, Rachel comes to experience this demand directly on several occasions, usually when asked to introduce herself. During an outing, St John Hirst, one of her companions, proposes that each member of their party should provide \u201ca short biographical sketch.\u201dFootnote26 In response, Rachel states that she is \u201ctwenty-four years of age, the daughter of a ship-owner, that she had never been properly educated; played the piano, had no brothers or sisters, and lived at Richmond with her aunts, her mother being dead\u201d (159). This matter-of-fact description is only comparable in substance to the Who\u2019s Who compendium of short biographies of famous historical figures Rachel reads on board her father\u2019s ship, which takes her to the fictional colonial location of Santa Marina, where most of the novel\u2019s action takes place.Footnote27 She issues this string of facts, referring to her age, class, educational status, family history, and her sole occupation efficiently and impersonally, as if in fear or under duress, each comma marking yet another aspect of her social personhood. She presents herself as a common, not a singular being, one of many, her identity not porous, but impermeable, forged under the pressure of the unforgivable inevitability of norms.\nTerence Hewet, an aspiring novelist, and Rachel\u2019s future fianc\u00e9e, also challenges her to give an account of herself. At Terence\u2019s prompt, \u201cRachel,\u201d the narrator states, \u201clost her freedom and became self-conscious. She felt herself at once singular and under observation\u201d (245). For Felski, this would constitute a moment of recognition, which, unlike Butler, she sees as a potentially generative experience. When we engage in a process of recognition, she writes, \u201cwe make sense of what is unfamiliar by fitting it into an existing scheme, linking it to what we already know.\u201dFootnote28 But this initial connection with the norms we recognize does not have to produce an experience that is repetitive, derivative, or in any way subordinating. Instead, it could show us things in a new light, compelling us to imagine a \u201crevised or altered sense of who I am.\u201dFootnote29 On her reading, the self-conscious moment can simultaneously serve \u201cas a social diagnosis and an ethical judgement.\u201dFootnote30 As a result, she advocates preserving a certain epistemological openness, which harbors the potential to create new forms of self-knowledge that can be taken up by the subject through a phenomenological relation of \u201cself-scrutiny rather than self-loss.\u201dFootnote31\n\nThe startling experience of self-consciousness, provoked in Rachel by Terence\u2019s demand, however, is presented by Woolf as inimical to her freedom. Overwhelmed by the demands of recognition, the self-realization that she must become intelligible as a subject of norms threatens her capacity for generating self-knowledge. The realization that he sees her as a woman additionally inhibits Rachel\u2019s ability to communicate an individual position. Furthermore, she feels constrained and \u201champered,\u201d the necessity of self-scrutiny only revealing more loss of possibility (246\u20137). In this moment of self-consciousness Rachel comprehends her dependence on Terence and her own vulnerability, exposing Woolf\u2019s own critique of recognition predicated on the certainty of knowledge as model of emancipation. Instead, Rachel\u2019s freedom is diminished, she becomes an object of enquiry, of knowledge, and of desire, which can be mastered and acquired by others.Footnote32 Once she perceives her newly drawn outline produced through Terence\u2019s recognition of her womanhood, she is compelled to inhabit it by modifying or relinquishing other fragments of her identity. In this way, the norm prevails, forcing an act of dispossession.Footnote33 Louise DeSalvo draws attention to the differences between the first English edition of the novel and the first American one, published five years later, at this crucial moment in the development of the relationship between Rachel and Terence. The American edition, DeSalvo observes, offers a more combative Rachel, who refuses to be \u201cpinned down by any second person,\u201d which demonstrates Woolf\u2019s heightened attention to emphasizing the disbalance in the hermeneutic positions which Rachel and Terence occupy in this exchange.Footnote34 Rachel never demands a reciprocal account from Terence, allowing him the possibility to escape self-scrutiny and categorization. The novel purposefully refuses to represent this exchange between the two lovers as reciprocal and equal, a point which serves to complicate models of analysing ethical readings of recognition as \u201cdyadic encounters,\u201d which tend to equalize the power both agents hold in the validation of one another.Footnote35 In the context of a social infrastructure built upon networks of patriarchal power, Woolf seems to be suggesting, the position of women in this exercise, is one of deep disadvantage. In this sense, the common meeting place becomes less of a democratic locus for reinvention and more of a battleground for survival.\n\nBecoming a person\nEarly in the novel, Rachel is described as someone who is struggling to become a person. The prime impediments to this are associated with her ability to adequately employ her rational faculties, accumulate knowledge, and exercise command over her language. \u201cA hesitation in speaking,\u201d the narrator observes, \u201cor rather a tendency to use the wrong words, made her seem more than normally incompetent for her years\u201d (15\u201316). Further on we are told that \u201cher eyes were unreflecting as water\u201d and \u201cher mind was absent\u201d (17). As Allison Pease notes, this is not an unusual representation of womanhood in early twentieth-century literature. Rachel \u201chas failed the qualifications of post-Cartesian selfhood,\u201d she \u201cknows nothing; she thinks and feels, but she is an outsider to a system that produces knowing individuals.\u201dFootnote36 The inability to find the words to express her thoughts is a source of confusion both for Rachel herself and the people around her. Her preference for musical over literary forms of expression, reflective of her discomfort with explicit verbal identifications, is evident throughout the text. As a result, Rachel is seen as someone who is not possessed of the ability to generate rational certainty, making this one of the main issues in terms of her characterization. Emma Sutton connects this to her \u201cinarticulateness\u201d and the difficulties of expressing the intense richness of inner thought through the limited commands of spoken language.Footnote37 Molly Hite goes even further to suggest that in favoring \u201can inherently nonrepresentational\u201d art of expression for Rachel, Woolf curates \u201can aesthetic form that invents rather than represents.\u201dFootnote38 Music creates modalities of connection and identification that are non-structural and non-hierarchical, and allow Rachel to give full expression to the complexities of her interiority without having to negotiate the struggle for recognition.\n\nIn a novel, whose characters\u2019 chief occupation, as Eric Sandberg observes, is \u201cdefining, or characterizing, other people,\u201d Rachel\u2019s lack of clear outline presents a puzzle.Footnote39 In addition to failing the Cartesian principles of selfhood, rooted in rational self-examination, she seems to lack awareness of the gendered aspects of socialization. Mrs Helen Ambrose, her aunt, functions as a figure of female authority, whose role is to induct Rachel in traditional practices of womanhood, including those associated with motherhood and marriage. She takes it upon herself to \u201cenlighten\u201d (105) the young woman, whose sheltered upbringing by her two (unmarried) aunts, following the death of her mother, according to Helen, is the reason why she appears so removed from worldly interpersonal affairs, especially those associated with sexual desire. Rachel\u2019s encounter with Mr Dalloway on the ship to Santa Marina, provides a brief and unwelcome disclosure in this regard. During one of their brief conversations, he prompts: \u201c\u2018[\u2009\u2026\u2009] Now tell me about yourself. What are your interests and occupations?\u2019\u201d Rachel responds: \u201c\u2018You see, I\u2019m a woman\u2019\u201d (79).Footnote40 Her admission is met with an outburst of passion, which moves Mr Dalloway to assault her with a kiss, following which he misdirects responsibility for the violent act and accuses her of temptation. The direct second-person address, \u201c\u2018You tempt me,\u2019\u201d summons an act of individual agency Rachel is unable to account for (80). Her resulting feelings range from discomfort to fear, she is unable to sleep and stop thinking about the experience, feeling persecuted and entrapped. She confides in Helen, who simply explains that this is the way things are between men and women: \u201cit\u2019s the most natural thing in the world\u201d (86). This leads Rachel to formulate a link between herself and \u201cthose women in Piccadilly,\u201d who her aunt confirms are prostitutes (86). As Hite emphasizes, \u201cthe existence and meaning of the prostitute are of acute importance to a young girl entering the arena of sexual arrangements.\u201dFootnote41 The topic emerges again in a discussion with Evelyn Murgatroyd, another character in the novel, who is trying to navigate her marriage prospects, when it is explicitly linked to the economic foundations of marriage, understood as a \u201crelation of sexual ownership.\u201dFootnote42 The process of becoming a person recognizable by others for Rachel, as for Evelyn, and the rest of the women in the novel, is inevitably tied with negotiating the terms on which their bodies will be interpreted, valued, and possessed. The moment of confrontation with patriarchal sexuality leads Rachel to see \u201cher life for the first time [as] a creeping hedged-in thing, driven cautiously between high walls, here turned aside, there plunged in darkness, made dull and crippled forever\u201d (87). She suddenly starts to understand how gendered expectations restrict and direct behavior. This emerging sense of limitation foregrounds the conflict between the normative rituals associated with Rachel\u2019s \u201cculturally determined destiny\u201d as a wife and mother, as Christine Froula has argued, and her desire to \u201cbreak out of the female initiation plot that her culture imposes upon women, constituting them not as fully legitimated participants in history and culture.\u201dFootnote43 Woolf\u2019s concerns with this process of legitimation are linked to the institutional hierarchies that create disparities between those who can claim to be possessors of the means of knowledge production and those who can only acquire the resulting outcomes, a distinction which radically alters the balance of power in the practice of recognition.\n\nThe Voyage Out interrogates the role literature and practices of reading play in the establishments of these hierarchies, particularly as they relate to the education of women. As Friedman observes, \u201cthe reading of people\u201d and \u201cthe reading of books\u201d in the novel are often presented as binary opposites \u2013 the former related to the social sphere, and generally the domain of women and the latter, linked to the institutional production of knowledge, and thus reserved for men.Footnote44 The politics of reading was a topic that clearly occupied Woolf during the extended composition period of the novel, stretching from 1908 to 1913, during which she completed several essays on the topic.Footnote45 In the novel itself, Rachel receives instruction on her reading by various male characters, including Richard Dalloway, St John Hirst and her uncle, Ridley Ambrose. Mr Dalloway suggests Burke\u2019s writings on the American and French revolutions to induce a development of a political conscience. St John recommends Gibbon\u2019s multivolume history of the Roman empire as a way to test the viability of her mind. Mr Ambrose offers a course of learning based on the contents of his travel library that stretches from Balzac back to Marlowe.Footnote46 In his study, she is allowed to select her own reading and leaves with Le Cousine Bette (1846), a novel which displays women\u2019s insubordinate behavior as a persistent threat to the bourgeois stability of the family unit.\n\nAs the narrative develops, it is through the study and performance of literary characters that Rachel begins to take a more definite shape:\n\n\u201cWhat I want to know,\u201d she said aloud, \u201cis this: What is the truth? What is the truth of it all?\u201d She was speaking partly as herself and partly as the heroine of the play she had just read. [\u2009\u2026\u2009] for the moment she herself was the most vivid thing in it \u2013 a heroic statue in the middle of the foreground, dominating the view. Ibsen\u2019s plays always left her in that condition. She acted them for days at a time, greatly to Helen\u2019s amusement; and then it would be Meredith\u2019s turn and she became Diana of the Crossways, but Helen was aware that it was not all acting, and that some sort of change was taking place in the human being. (136\u20137)\n\nRachel\u2019s selection of texts focuses on the stories of modern women who inhabit a hostile world and commit various transgressive acts to free themselves from the confines associated with their gender identity.Footnote47 Her choices also reflect a forming idea of social inequality as Ibsen is followed \u201cby a novel such as Mrs Ambrose detested, whose purpose was to distribute the guilt of a woman\u2019s downfall upon the right shoulders\u201d (138). In addition to providing her with examples of womanhood, modern fiction also offers a space for experimentation with language. She reads the shiny, yellow-covered books \u201cwith the curious literalness of one to whom written sentences are unfamiliar, and handling words as though they were made of wood, separately of great importance, and possessed of shapes like tables and chairs\u201d (137\u20138). Rachel uses the language of literary representation to learn the normative shapes and sizes of modern human experience, and particularly that of women, aware that words carry the weight of the meanings ascribed to them. This experience of trying on fictional characters highlights the collaborative force with which language, norms, and forms come together to formulate the recognizable models of identification available to the modern reader.\nRachel\u2019s education and reading practice slowly create an archive of linguistic and behavioral codes to help her construct a picture of a coherent gendered personhood. As her performance within her social circle improves and reaches the expected standard, Mrs Ambrose directly gives her permission to be a person:\n\n\u201cSo now you can go ahead and be a person on your own account,\u201d she added. The vision of her own personality, of herself as a real everlasting thing, different from anything else, unmergeable, like the see or the wind, flashed in Rachel\u2019s mind, and she became profoundly excited at the thought of living. (90)\n\nRachel\u2019s jubilation at this prospect does not materialize in a conscious effort of making herself into a \u201creal everlasting thing\u201d; instead, she slides out of view at every chance of establishing herself, a practice encouraged by her eclectic reading. As Butler argues, the draw towards accounting for oneself as a singular subject, in search for social validation, is a crucial step in the practice of recognition, that inevitably comes to clash with the necessity to do so within a normative framework of social relations. Any such account will have to involve parts that do not belong to the subject, whether because they are linked with the norms that direct her own self-constitution or the norms that guide her expression and intelligibility. In this respect, Butler asserts, \u201cit is only in dispossession that I can and do give an account of myself.\u201dFootnote48 Having \u201clearned something about the social limits to her possibilities,\u201d in Hite\u2019s formulation, Rachel is shown to realize the constrained scope of agential action, determined by the gender norms associated with her self-development, within which she is allowed to operate.Footnote49 The novel also adapts to this disruption of the recognition arc and its \u201crepresentational strategies\u201d and begins to \u201cdefine her body more and more in terms of an observer\u2019s gaze,\u201d manifesting its awareness that \u201cthe knowledge of and entrance into the public realm involve endangering other kinds of knowledge and other realms of ontological contact.\u201dFootnote50\nEntering the public sphere\nFollowing her experience of self-consciousness triggered by the confrontation with Terence\u2019s demand, Rachel perceives that the shapes she can inhabit that can generate recognition in response are always already there, carved out of normative demands. The implied function of recognition as a regulation principle, which determines the forms of identity that can be legitimately adopted within the wider normative order, is exposed during the Sunday church service. Rachel looks at the faces she knows from luncheons, walks, and card games and for the first time regards them as fabricated. This realization triggers a process of Cartesian revelation, which makes her reject \u201call that she had implicitly believed\u201d (265). She is unsettled by her fellow travelers\u2019 need for validation, which makes them into \u201cslavishly acquiescent [\u2009\u2026\u2009] limpet[s],\u201d who allow themselves to be co-opted within a deeply suspect economy of exchange (265). Rachel\u2019s internal monologue shows her becoming critically aware of the norms of legibility which govern the social order in which she is expected to enlist. This is the closest the novel comes to articulating a scene of recognition in the traditional sense and it is significant that Rachel\u2019s transition from a position of relative inexperience to one of \u201cenlightenment\u201d occurs not as an act of self-reflection, but as one of public reading. In her previous encounters with the male characters who demand an account of herself, she has been evasive, impersonal, but never fully open or entirely paradigmatic as a participant in the economy of desire. Instinctively aware of the threat recognition carries for her own singularity, she is not prepared to be transparent to others, her presence in interpersonal exchanges being marked by a curious elusiveness and withholding of substance. Woolf\u2019s own elusiveness in terms of offering \u201cauthorial guidance\u201d functions not only through the presentation of \u201cconflicting tonal cues\u201d in relation to the reading of characters, but through her deliberate refusal to structure her narrative around the recognition coordinates expected of it.Footnote51 In this way, she also expands her critical examination from its initial focus on the normative links that are used to construct the novel as a form primary concerned with the representation of personhood, into the \u201cpolitical stakes of the specific work of literary production.\u201dFootnote52\n\nWoolf\u2019s skeptical attitude towards the function of the literary establishment, which to a large extent determines the relationship between texts, authors, and readers, forms an important part of her larger institutional critique. She is particularly disparaging in her evaluation of the British reading public\u2019s attachment to norms, expectations, and habitual practices. She declares it \u201ca very suggestible and docile creature,\u201d which often persists in supporting commonly held notions. In her view, the public generally wants books to confirm their own view of the world, without much defiance:\n\n[o]ld women have houses. They have fathers. They have incomes. They have hot-water bottles. This is how we know that they are old women. Mr Wells and Mr Bennett and Mr Galsworthy have always taught us that this is the way to recognise them.Footnote53\n\nA relationship of this kind conducted on the basis of supply and demand principles, for Woolf, \u201cceases to be a means of communication between writer and reader, and becomes instead an obstacle and an impediment.\u201dFootnote54 This misconception of the novel\u2019s function underscores its implied cooperation with the maintenance of established social standards in the context of patriarchal capitalist modernity. As Victoria Baena argues, through a reading of Walter Benjamin\u2019s 1934 essay \u201cThe Author as a Producer,\u201d the \u201crole of the intellectual\u201d should be understood \u201cless in terms of political \u2018commitment\u2019 than as the writer of works that change or at least challenge the world\u201d \u2013 an apt description of Woolf\u2019s statement of intent in her debut novel and a lens through which to read her subsequent experiments with literary work in all its guises, as a form of feminist social criticism.Footnote55\nAfter the church scene, Rachel begins to fade away from the narrative. Her status as a protagonist is repeatedly disrupted and diminished instead of asserted and expanded; until, finally, her death is reduced to a conversation topic after tea. Even when she accepts Terence\u2019s offer of marriage during their visit to an Indigenous village, she is not really a person with a mind of her own, and only echoes the sentiments he offers her, adhering to social protocol.\n\n\u201cYou like being with me?\u201d Terence asked. \u201cYes, with you,\u201d she replied. [\u2009\u2026\u2009] \u201cWe are happy together.\u201d He did not seem to be speaking, or she to be hearing. \u201cVery happy,\u201d she answered. [\u2009\u2026\u2009] \u201cWe love each other,\u201d Terence said. \u201cWe love each other,\u201d she repeated. (316)\n\nRachel\u2019s position in the novel becomes further obscured as other characters start relating to her as Terence\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, following the announcement of the engagement. Their previous caution towards her is quickly overcome by her identification as a social presence they can recognize. While returning \u201cThank You\u201d notes she thinks it strange that \u201cconsidering how very different these people were, [\u2009\u2026\u2009] they used almost the same sentences when they wrote to congratulate her upon her engagement\u201d (342). Shortly after this, Rachel\u2019s fever overcomes her and she slips out of consciousness.Footnote56 This is the final act of dispossession the novel performs. The form of personhood available to her as a married woman obstructs all other possible accounts she might have wished to draw for herself. Even though Rachel agrees to become Terence\u2019s wife, the norms which govern this decision are not hers to make but are hers to comply with. As Butler asserts,\none invariably struggles with conditions of one\u2019s own life that one could not have chosen. If there is an operation of agency or, indeed, freedom in this struggle, it takes place in the context of an enabling and limiting field of constraint.\n\nBy allowing Rachel to break out of the characterization model allocated for women in the Bildungsroman, Woolf undermines the exercise of choice as an expression of agency, and with that the entire foundation on which the \u201cidealized representation of [the] autonomous male subject\u201d rests.Footnote58 Rachel\u2019s disrupted narrative shows that under conditions of patriarchal oppression, the self-determination narrative, mapped out across various points of recognition, becomes another form of control.\nConclusion\nIn theoretical terms, literary character has almost exclusively been discussed as a universal concept, nearly an ideal, akin to that of the autonomous Kantian subject, and in many ways designed to replicate it. Its failures and successes are decided by the same measure. It is often encumbered by expectations of accuracy, truthfulness, and relatability, which all combine to curate a reading process organized around the principle of recognition, both as an aesthetic and political construct. Woolf, however, saw this as a rather restrictive convention and made her opposition to it the cornerstone of her critical engagement with modern fiction. One of the reasons she questioned recognition-based principles for the construction and reading of fiction was connected to a concern about the potential of this convention to narrow the field of authorial invention and thus obscure the novel\u2019s ability to respond to changing social realities. Another, was a more broadly political one, connected to the representation of women in fiction. Woolf worried that a recognition-based model for the construction of personhood, can be used to support a binary world of power and gender relations, where norms are used to control the formation and expressions of identity and the ways in which they can be legitimized. Woolf\u2019s interest in this project, initiated in her first novel and continued throughout her writing life, is not confined to simply decoding the restrictive and implicit dangers of relying on such models in fiction as well as in life. Her first novel begins the work of proposing a new code of practice that would support more diverse forms of personhood and engender the formation of novel and emancipatory forms of political life. In this project the purpose of the novelist appears to be nothing short of imagining personhood anew, of learning to re-cognize it, and deliver it from the confines of its traditional forms.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The writing style in the provided paragraphs is academic, analytical, and formal.

Nightwood lacks \u201cthe intimacy of a Colette or Woolf novel\u201d in its resistance to meaning.Footnote3 Nearly twenty years later, Teresa de Lauretis, in her analysis of Nightwood as a meditation on Freud\u2019s sex and death drives, admits to having a similar issue:\n\n\nI approached this text several times over the years, but it was not until I read Barthes that I understood why I could not go on reading Nightwood: the narrative anchorage eluded me, was too weak or too dispersed; the chain of signifiers would not halt, would not find a resting point where meaning could temporarily congeal.Footnote4\n\n\nDespite the historical gap and the accumulation of feminist scholarship (roughly 100 book- and journal-articles in the past two decades), the difficulty of giving the novel a feminist meaning remains a challenge for feminist scholarship. In \u201cMelancholic Remedies: Djuna Barnes\u2019s Nightwood as Narrative Theory,\u201d Katherine A. Fama argues that feminist studies like those of Marcus and de Lauretis, celebrating Nightwood\u2019s abject identities and appropriating earlier structural models, \u201care problematized by Barnes\u2019s own pronounced hostility to identity politics.\u201dFootnote5 Moreover, I would add that such readings fail to address the ways in which Barnes\u2019s novel \u201cbucks narrative, revealing our compulsions to retell, read, and know.\u201dFootnote6 Marcus\u2019s and de Lauretis\u2019s similar difficulties with Nightwood suggest to me that the problem is not just with the novel but with feminist critique itself. Why, I wonder, do feminists persist in trying to locate meaning in narrative where it does not exist?\nThe answer to this question is best highlighted through Jean Baudrillard\u2019s theory of seduction \u2013 admittedly the b\u00eate noire of feminism \u2013 which helps to underscore some feminists\u2019 reliance on what Baudrillard terms the ideology of production in our readings of novels and history.Footnote7 In Seduction (1979), Baudrillard argues that society is structured through production: our various systems for meaning that rely heavily upon verifiable facts and reality in order to maintain the boundaries of class, race, and gender. The ideology of production includes Freudian psychoanalysis, Marxist economics, and Saussurian linguistics \u2013 discourses which reinforce the primacy of sex, work, and language as social values. For Baudrillard, as long as production continues to structure society, hierarchy will inevitably follow. However, Baudrillard also provides a challenge to productive discourse in the form of \u201cseduction\u201d: seduction has the potential to overturn hierarchical powers of production. Although the term is traditionally defined as sexual manipulation, Baudrillard locates seduction in spectacle and artifice. And nowhere does seduction produce meaning.\n\n\nEverything from cosmetics to animals, from transvestites to actresses, from masquerade to finery falls under Baudrillard\u2019s theory of seduction because, in each case, what appears is all there is. In Seduction, Baudrillard myopically criticizes feminists for going in the direction of the system that oppresses them by searching for both meaning and truth, rather than issuing a challenge to productive ideology:\n\n\nThere is a strange fierce complicity between the feminist movement and the order of truth\u2009\u2026\u2009In one stroke the immense privilege of the feminine is effaced: the privilege of having never acceded to truth or meaning, and of having remained absolute master of the realm of appearances. The capacity immanent to seduction to deny things their truth and turn it into a game, the pure play of appearances, and thereby foil all systems of power and meaning with a mere turn of the hand.Footnote8\n\n\nFor Baudrillard, feminism, in its perpetuation of terms like women\u2019s subjectivity, sexuality, and language, only preserves the hierarchies inherent in these terms. Seduction, on the other hand, \u201cthe pure play of appearances,\u201d issues a challenge to such ideologies by highlighting the weakness of meaning-making systems. In this article, I argue that the literary use of the circus creates a social space of seduction which challenges the supremacy of production by actively resisting meaning through the persistent display of the spectacle. Foregrounding the obvious, yet critically unacknowledged, similarities between Djuna Barnes\u2019s Nightwood and Angela Carter\u2019s Nights at the Circus (1984), I read the circus in Nightwood as a feminist tool of resistance to productive meaning. In many ways, Carter\u2019s Nights at the Circus can be understood as a postmodern retelling of the modernist Nightwood, and thus key to our understanding of Barnes\u2019s feminism.\nMany feminist readings of both Nightwood and Nights at the Circus tend, justifiably, to center around alternative, non-oppressive formulations for subjectivity, sexuality, and desire. For example, in Djuna Barnes\u2019 Consuming Fictions (2008), Diane Warren argues that the central concern of Barnes\u2019s novel is \u201cthe cultural construction of identity\u201d and \u201cthe limits of subversion.\u201dFootnote9 Warren reads Barnes\u2019s character Robin Vote as a symbol of \u201ca more complex and fluid interpretation of identity construction\u201d who pronounces \u201cher own subjectivity by emblematizing the divergent aspects of her identity.\u201dFootnote10 Similarly, scholars of Angela Carter\u2019s Nights at the Circus analyze the text to elucidate more inclusive forms of gender and sexuality. In \u201cFreak Show Femininities: Intersectional Spectacles In Angela Carter\u2019s Nights at the Circus\u201d (2014), Erin Douglas argues that Carter\u2019s main character, Fevvers, problematizes identity categories by moving between binaries. But far from exposing Carter\u2019s challenge to philosophical discourse on identity, Douglas concludes that the female characters in Carter\u2019s novel \u201cresist heteronormative ideas of femininity and normalcy thereby offering queer performativity and creating narratives of non-normative genders and sexualities.\u201dFootnote11 While celebrating marginalized classifications for identity and sexuality in feminist scholarship on Barnes and Carter is warranted, I argue that these alternative formulations for subjectivity and sexuality actually reinforce the concepts of power systems that feminists aim to challenge. Instead, both Barnes and Carter, by setting their novels in the circus with its culture of seduction, present a more radical position by fixing their critique on the problems inherent in these terms, implementing a feminist challenge to what Baudrillardian feminist Victoria Grace calls the \u201csubjectifying impulse.\u201dFootnote12 Reading these novels together foregrounds this challenge. Besides the obvious link in titles, the circus backdrop, the \u201cliving museums,\u201d and the physical traversing of three countries, Carter even adapts one of Barnes\u2019s minor circus characters, \u201cKing Buffo,\u201d morphing him into \u201cBuffo the Clown.\u201d And while \u201cKing Buffo\u201d has no speaking part in Nightwood, Buffo the Clown\u2019s words in Nights at the Circus offer an important clue to the feminism deployed by both Carter and Barnes: specifically, a feminism that posits the artifice of the circus against prevalent feminist and philosophical notions of subjectivity.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In analyzing the writing style and tone of the text, the following observations can be made:\n\n1.

The story is told from the perspective of Offred, a woman who is forced into sexual servitude due to her ability to have children. In the novel, the importance of clothing, language, and religious beliefs are three prominent themes that play a role in shaping the dystopian world. These themes work together to create a world where women are denied agency and autonomy.\n\nClothing\n\nThe handmaids in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale are forced to wear a specific outfit known as the \u201chabit.\u201d This habit comprises of a long, red dress that covers the women from head to toe to symbolize their chastity. The habit serves as a means of control, as it is impossible for the wearer to move or see freely. The handmaids are also required to wear white bonnets with wings to signify their limited vision, reminding them of their place in society. The habit, therefore, serves as a reminder of the handmaids' lack of agency and autonomy.\n\nAtwood also explores how clothing can be used as a tool of resistance against oppression. Offred takes part in small acts such as taking her prescribed habits and hiding them, or putting on a different outfit to claim agency and individuality. In an oppressive society, the freedom of self-expression is taken away, and clothing is one way to resist domination, even if it is a small act.\n\nLanguage\n\nLanguage is another important theme in the novel. The government of Gilead creates a new language, which they refer to as \"the language.\" In Gilead, new words are introduced, while others, such as \u201clove,\u201d \u201cfamily,\u201d or \u201cfriendship,\u201d are forbidden. The language is gendered, aiming to control women by reducing their value into their reproductive capabilities. The word \u201chandmaid\u201d is an example of how language can reflect the oppression of women. It defines a woman solely as a reproductive vessel, taking away her humanity, individuality, and identity. \n\nLanguage plays a significant role in shaping people's thoughts and action. As a reader, we witness how language can reduce the characters\u2019 ability to understand and reflect upon their own experiences. The Aunts, for example, use language to dehumanize the handmaids further. They strip them of their names, referring to them only by their assigned roles such as Handmaid, Wife, or Econowife, to emphasize their subservience.\n\nHowever, the use of language is not always a tool of oppression but can be used as a tool of resistance. Moira, a character from the novel, uses language to resist oppression. Despite the oppressive regime, she still refers to herself as a \u201cdyke to watch out for\u201d and does not allow the authorities to assign her a label that reduces her to her sexual orientation.\n\nReligious Beliefs\n\n The ruling class in Gilead uses religion as a tool to justify their oppressive regime. The oppressive government uses the story of Jacob and Rachel, a biblical story where two sisters are used in childbearing, to justify the use of Handmaids. Religious beliefs also play a significant role in shaping societal norms in Gilead. Women who are unwilling or unable to reproduce are considered of no value and are left to work in undesirable jobs, such as the Colonies. Rather than being seen as individuals who have their own interests, these women are demoted to be a means to an end.\n\nHowever, Atwood's message is not an attack on religion; instead, she exposes how religion can be misused to justify oppression. The novel brings out the point that oppressive societies often use religion to justify their actions, promoting a particular way of life and disregarding individual freedoms. \n\nConclusion\n\nAtwood\u2019s novel The Handmaid's Tale explore different themes that make it an iconic work of feminist dystopian literature. In the novel, the importance of clothing, language, and religious beliefs play a significant role in shaping the dystopian world portrayed in the novel. The themes reinforce each other to create a world where women are denied agency and autonomy. The use of language, from changing names to manipulating vocabulary, reflects the oppression of women. Clothing serves as a reminder of their lack of agency, while religious beliefs are used to justify this oppression. Ultimately, Atwood's novel raises important questions about the nature of autonomy, individualism, and oppression, and how these themes are interwoven to form a dystopian society."}]}, {"facetValue": "write an 8-page literary analysis essay on the importance of clothing, language, and religious beliefs in The Handmaid's Tale.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "write an 8-page literary analysis essay on the importance of clothing, language, and religious beliefs in The Handmaid's Tale."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "perform a literary analysis on the themes of clothing, language, and religious beliefs in The Handmaid's Tale."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "write a 8 page literary analysis essay on the importance of clothing, language, and religious beliefs in the handmaid tale"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Title: Clothing, Language, and Religious Beliefs in The Handmaid's Tale: Tools of Control and Resistance\n\nIntroduction\n\nMargaret Atwood's novel, The Handmaid's Tale, is a gripping dystopian tale that explores the terrifying consequences of a society built on strict authoritarianism, fundamentalist religious doctrine, and misogyny. Set in a near-future version of the United States, the story follows the experiences of Offred, a Handmaid who is forced to comply with a highly structured and oppressive regime known as the Republic of Gilead. At its core, the novel examines the means by which totalitarian governments enforce their control and how the people subjugated under their rule can push back against the oppressor. In this essay, we will examine three critical aspects of this society that serve as powerful tools for control and resistance: clothing, language, and religious beliefs. We will analyze how the ruling regime uses these tools to manipulate and subdue the population and how the characters, in turn, employ them to assert their humanity and challenge the status quo.\n\nClothing as a Mechanism of Control and Resistance\n\nIn The Handmaid's Tale, clothing serves as a critical device to enforce social order and division. The Republic of Gilead assigns specific clothing to different classes of women, effectively segregating them according to their social roles and perceived worth. The Handmaids, for example, are forced to wear long red dresses and white bonnets \u2013 a uniform that simultaneously marks them as fertile women and visually isolates them from other women in Gilead. This strict dress code serves multiple purposes. Primarily, it facilitates control, as the women are easily identifiable and unable to blend into the broader society. Additionally, the clothing itself has connotations of purity and modesty, reinforcing the oppressive patriarchal values that inform their social status.\n\nHowever, clothing also serves as a mechanism of resistance for the women in the story. As Offred begins to push back against the constraints of her society, she starts to notice the ways that the other characters use their uniforms as a form of silent protest. For example, Moira, a rebellious Handmaid, alters her red dress to make it tighter and more sexually suggestive \u2013 a defiant mockery of the modesty required of her by the regime. Similarly, Offred herself finds small moments of empowerment through clothing. The red cloak that she is required to wear symbolically represents a kind of armor, and on multiple occasions, she takes solace in the fact that her uniform allows her a certain level of anonymity and protection.\n\nLanguage as a Tool for Control and Subversion\n\nLanguage is another prominent theme in the novel, and it is used both as a means of control and a vehicle for resistance. The regime of Gilead employs language as a tool to impose its authority and reconfigure societal norms. Through the manipulation of language, the state seeks to reshape reality itself, reframing human interactions and relationships to align with its ideological goals. One of the most significant examples of this is the renaming of women to reflect their roles in the society. Offred, whose real name is never revealed, is called \"Of-Fred,\" emphasizing her function as a Handmaid belonging to her Commander, Fred.\n\nThe state also manipulates language by forbidding women to read or write, effectively silencing them and hobbling their capacity to engage in self-expression and knowledge acquisition. This prohibition seeks to diminish the value of intellectual pursuits and diminish women's autonomy further. Nevertheless, the women in the story use language in subversive ways, like the secret messages written by previous Handmaids that Offred discovers hidden in her room. These messages serve as a lifeline for Offred, connecting her to a community of resistance and providing a sense that she is not alone in her struggle against the regime.\n\nAdditionally, even though reading is forbidden, Offred employs a clandestine form of literacy by interpreting signs and symbols she encounters, such as the hanging bodies of dissenters on display in town or the Eye of Gilead, a symbol representing the state's ever-watchful gaze. Through her awareness and interpretation of these signs, Offred maintains a level of mental freedom that is threatened but never fully suppressed by the state's linguistic manipulations.\n\nReligious Beliefs as a Means of Control and Empowerment\n\nIn The Handmaid's Tale, religious beliefs and practices are instrumentalized by the state to legitimize its actions and justify its oppressive policies. The regime of Gilead uses religion as a powerful means of control, imposing a warped interpretation of Christianity onto the population that justifies its gendered caste system, forced impregnation of Handmaids, and violent punishments. By presenting its ideology as divinely sanctioned, the state seeks to make its authority seem absolute and unquestionable.\n\nHowever, religious belief also offers a way for individuals to maintain a sense of dignity and personal integrity amidst the totalitarian system. Although Offred is deeply skeptical of the state's religious motivations, she does find solace in her own private and more genuine forms of spiritual practice. For instance, she frequently reads passages from the Bible and mentally recites a modified version of the Lord's Prayer, emphasizing compassion and individual responsibility rather than the patriarchal themes prioritized by Gilead.\n\nAdditionally, the character of Aunt Lydia serves as a crucial example of the duality of religious belief and action within the society. As a figure responsible for the indoctrination and control of the Handmaids, Aunt Lydia constantly espouses the distorted religious doctrine of Gilead. However, Offred frequently ponders the sincerity of Aunt Lydia's beliefs, proposing the possibility that she is simply using religion as an instrument to exercise power and instill fear.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn The Handmaid's Tale, clothing, language, and religious beliefs serve as powerful tools for both control and resistance within the oppressive state of Gilead. By examining these elements closely, we are able to better understand the mechanisms by which totalitarian regimes exert power and the ways in which individuals can subvert this power to assert their humanity and challenge the status quo. From defying dress codes to engaging in secret forms of literacy, the women in the novel find ways to resist and maintain their dignity against all odds. In this way, Atwood's novel importantly emphasizes the resilience of the human spirit, showing that even in the bleakest of situations, individuals can find ways to assert their autonomy and fight for a better world."}]}]}, {"summary": "Provide and analyze character backstories and specific story elements from various Russian literary works.", "name": "Analyze Literary Works", "children": [],

The connection of Hermanubis with Cynopolis and a priest of Anubis suggests a continued association with the traditional Anubis, and a separation between the traditional funerary Anubis and Hermanubis may not be necessary."}]}]}]}]}
