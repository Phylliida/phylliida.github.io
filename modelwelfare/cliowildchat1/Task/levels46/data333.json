When you delete rows in separate transactions, each transaction requires resources like creating a new undo log for the undo operation, obtaining locks for each row, performing multiple writes for each row deletion to both redo log and undo log, and so on.\n\nBy deleting those same set of rows in just one transaction, you can significantly reduce the overhead and improve performance. In a single transaction, InnoDB will only need to create one undo log, can obtain locks more efficiently, and can perform fewer writes to redo log and undo log as compared to separate transactions.\n\nHowever, if you are deleting a significant number of rows, you should consider the impact on your server's memory, transaction log size, and other system resources, as well as the possible impact on concurrent users or processes. In some cases, breaking the deletion process into smaller transactions called \"batch deletes\" may be a better solution to avoid potential problems caused by very large transactions."}, {"role": "user", "content": "\"overhead associated with each transaction\" - overhead of updating indexes (primary and secondaries) will also be there, correct?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, that's correct. The overhead associated with each transaction also includes updating the primary and secondary indexes. For every row deletion within a transaction, MySQL InnoDB needs to update the corresponding primary and secondary indexes accordingly.\n\nWhen you perform separate transactions for each deletion, the system will update indexes for each deleted row independently, resulting in more overhead and reduced performance. On the other hand, by deleting those same set of rows in one transaction, InnoDB can update indexes more efficiently, leading to better performance.\n\nHowever, as previously mentioned, if you are deleting a significant number of rows, you should also consider factors like memory usage, transaction log size, and possible impact on concurrent users or processes. In some cases, breaking the deletion process into smaller transactions or \"batch deletes\" may be a better solution to avoid potential problems caused by very large transactions."}, {"role": "user", "content": "if the chosen set of rows isn't updated by any other transaction, index update still requires a lock (at least partially) on the index if B+tree re-balance happens, correct?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, that's correct. When you update or delete rows in MySQL InnoDB, even if the chosen set of rows isn't being updated or accessed by any other transaction, the index update still requires locking, at least partially, on the index if a B+tree re-balance occurs. This is because changes to the index structure may impact other transactions, and InnoDB needs to ensure the read and write consistency.\n\nWhen deleting or updating rows, InnoDB obtains a row-level lock (also called record lock), which prevents any other transaction from modifying or deleting the locked row. Additionally, when the B+tree re-balance happens due to the index update, InnoDB may obtain a lock on a higher level in the index tree structure called a \"gap lock\" or \"next-key lock\". This is necessary to maintain the consistency of the B+tree structure and ensure other transactions can continue to read or insert data without conflicts.\n\nIt is important to note that InnoDB uses a multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) mechanism that allows multiple transactions to be executed concurrently while maintaining a consistent view of the data. This can help to minimize the impact of index locking on concurrent reads, but it may still have an impact on concurrent insert or update operations, depending on the index structure and locking granularity."}]}]}]}]}
