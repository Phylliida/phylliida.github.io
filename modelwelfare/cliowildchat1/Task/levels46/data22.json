When you act out of passion, you are intrinsically motivated to engage in the process, and you are likely to be more invested, focused, and persistent in your pursuit. The satisfaction derived from creating something out of passion often comes from the joy of the process itself and the personal fulfillment it brings, rather than external rewards or recognition.\n\nOn the other hand, making something out of obligation involves creating or doing something because of a sense of duty, responsibility, or external pressure. In this case, the motivation is extrinsic, usually coming from the expectations of others, social norms, or formal requirements. When acting out of obligation, the primary goal is often to satisfy the demands or expectations of others, rather than pursuing personal fulfillment or enjoyment. This can sometimes lead to a less inspired or less invested effort in the activity, and the satisfaction derived from completing the task is more related to the relief from the obligation rather than genuine joy.\n\nIn summary, the difference between making something out of passion and making something out of obligation lies in the source of motivation (intrinsic vs. extrinsic) and the level of personal fulfillment and enjoyment derived from the activity."}]}, {"facetValue": "analyze the usage of comparative forms in a given sentence.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "confirm the usage of \"smaller\" in the sentence as a comparative form."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "analyze the usage of comparative forms in a given sentence."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "smaller\u6bd4\u8f83\u7ea7\u7528\u7684\u5bf9\u4e48\uff1aBesides, the smaller Ni NPs enhanced the metal-acid synergy, leading to a higher selectivity to isomers.
