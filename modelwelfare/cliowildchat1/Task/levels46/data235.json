Or consider turning to dropshipping, where you connect with suppliers that ship products directly to your customers.\n\nConclusion\n\nEarning money online is achievable for those who are willing to learn, adapt, and put in the effort. The opportunities are nearly endless \u2013 it's just a matter of finding the ones that resonate with you.\n\nKeep in mind that success comes with time and persistence.

But have you ever thought about how Twitter makes money? In this article, we\u2019ll take an in-depth look at how the platform generates revenue and what strategies it uses to stay profitable.\n\n1. Advertising\n\nOne of the most significant ways Twitter makes money is through advertising. Twitter offers several advertising options to brands and marketers who want to reach their target audience. These options include:\n\nPromoted tweets: This type of ad appears on a user\u2019s Twitter timeline like a regular tweet, but it is marked as \u201cpromoted.\u201d Brands can target specific audiences based on demographics like location, interests, and even keywords.\n\nPromoted accounts: These are Twitter accounts that are promoted to appear in users' suggestion lists or in search results. Brands can target based on demographics like interests, location, and more.\n\nPromoted trends: These are sponsored topics that appear on Twitter\u2019s trending topics list. Brands can use promoted trends to create buzz around their product, service, or event.\n\nTwitter Ads API: Large advertisers who run a high volume of ads can use Twitter\u2019s Ads API to manage and automate their advertising campaigns.\n\n2. Data licensing\n\nTwitter generates a massive amount of data with every tweet, like user sentiments, hashtags, and trending topics. This data can be valuable to businesses and organizations in a variety of ways.\n\nTwitter sells access to its data to companies that are interested in learning more about their customers and target audience. For example, they can use Twitter data to track the success of a social media campaign, analyze customer feedback or track market trends.\n\nIn addition to selling data directly to businesses, Twitter has entered into data licensing agreements with third-party data providers like Nielson and Gnip to provide even more extensive data insights.\n\n3. Premium features\n\nTwitter also offers premium features to businesses and organizations that want to get the most out of their social media presence. One such feature is Twitter Analytics, which provides data and insights about a user\u2019s account and follower behavior. Twitter Analytics can help businesses optimize their social media strategy and understand what content resonates with their audience.\n\nOther premium features include promoted accounts, which can help brands increase their followers and visibility, and Twitter Amplify, a program that allows brands to promote their videos and video content on Twitter.\n\n4. E-commerce\n\nWhile Twitter hasn\u2019t fully jumped into the e-commerce game, the platform has partnered with companies like Stripe to enable in-tweet purchases.\n\nFor example, during the 2017 Super Bowl, Pizza Hut tweeted out a GIF of a pizza being delivered to a sports fan. Fans who clicked on the tweet could order a pizza directly through the tweet with just a few clicks.\n\nWhile e-commerce is not a core component of Twitter\u2019s business model yet, it could become a more significant player in the future.\n\n5. Data center leasing and network services\n\nIn addition to its revenue-generating activities, Twitter also has valuable assets such as data centers and network infrastructure. The company leases excess capacity within its data centers and network to third-party customers, generating additional revenue.\n\nThese services include colocation, managed hosting, and cloud hosting, among others. By leveraging its existing infrastructure, Twitter can monetize its digital assets and continue to grow its revenue streams in the future.\n\nConclusion\n\nTwitter has a diverse range of revenue streams, from advertising to data licensing to premium features and e-commerce that derive revenue. By leveraging its vast network and user data, Twitter can continue to expand its revenue streams and stay profitable for years to come."}]}, {"facetValue": "analyze a conversation about Twitter's revenue model and generate a high-quality article on the topic.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "understand how Twitter generates revenue and its business model."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "analyze a conversation about Twitter's revenue model and generate a high-quality article on the topic."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "write a 1500 words high quality article on the topic \u201chow does twitter make money\u201d."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Twitter has undoubtedly become one of the most popular social media platforms in the world, with over 330 million active users. It is a powerful tool for businesses, influencers, and individuals to connect with their audiences in real-time, share their thoughts, and promote their brand. But how does a platform like Twitter make money, especially considering that it is free to use?\n\nIn this article, we will explore how Twitter makes money, its business model, and how the company generates revenue.\n\nTwitter\u2019s Business Model\n\nTwitter\u2019s business model is based on advertising. Like other social media platforms, Twitter\u2019s primary source of revenue comes from advertising solutions it offers to businesses. More specifically, Twitter makes money through three main revenue streams:\n\n1. Advertising: Twitter sells advertising space to businesses looking to promote their products or services. Advertisers can target their ads based on different factors such as geolocation, keywords, interest, demographics, and behavior. This ensures that the ads are only shown to users who are likely to be interested in them, thus maximizing the effectiveness of the advertising campaign.\n\n2. Data licensing: Twitter sells access to its data to businesses that want to analyze and understand user behavior, trends, and sentiments. Companies can use this data to gain insights into their target audience, better understand market trends, and create more effective marketing campaigns.\n\n3. MoPub: MoPub is Twitter\u2019s mobile advertising exchange platform. MoPub allows publishers (mobile app developers) to monetize their apps by displaying ads. Advertisers can then buy ad space on these apps through MoPub, and publishers earn a share of the revenue generated.\n\nTwitter\u2019s Advertising Solutions\n\nTwitter offers different advertising solutions to businesses. Here are some of the most popular options:\n\n1. Promoted Tweets: Promoted Tweets are sponsored tweets that businesses pay to have appear at the top of users\u2019 feeds. These tweets appear like regular tweets with a \u201cpromoted\u201d label below the username. Businesses can target their promoted tweets based on user interests, demographics, device, location, or keywords.\n\n2. Promoted Accounts: Promoted Accounts are like promoted tweets, but for accounts. They allow businesses to get their accounts in front of more users who might be interested in following them. These accounts are recommended to users based on their interests, location, and behavior.\n\n3. Promoted Trends: Promoted Trends are sponsored hashtags that appear at the top of Twitter\u2019s trending topics list. They allow businesses to promote their hashtags and reach a wider audience.\n\n4. Video Ads: Twitter\u2019s video ads allow businesses to run video ads that appear in users\u2019 feeds. Twitter\u2019s video ads are short, usually 15 seconds or less.\n\nHow Twitter Generates Revenue\n\nNow that we\u2019ve explored Twitter\u2019s business model and advertising solutions, let\u2019s take a closer look at how the company generates revenue.\n\nTwitter\u2019s revenue largely comes from advertising. In Q3 of 2021, Twitter reported advertising revenue of $1.3 billion, which accounted for 85% of its total revenue. Twitter\u2019s advertising revenue is generated from different types of ads, including promoted tweets and accounts, video ads, and promoted trends.\n\nApart from advertising, Twitter also generates revenue from data licensing. Twitter\u2019s data licensing revenue was $100 million in Q3 2021, accounting for 7% of its total revenue. Data licensing revenue comes from businesses that purchase access to Twitter\u2019s data to analyze user behavior, trends, and sentiments.\n\nMoPub is also a significant source of revenue for Twitter. MoPub generated $141 million in Q3 2021, accounting for 9% of Twitter\u2019s total revenue. This revenue is generated from publishers that monetize their apps through MoPub and advertisers that buy ad space on these apps.\n\nTwitter\u2019s revenue growth has been impressive over the years. In Q3 2021, Twitter\u2019s revenue was $1.5 billion, a 37% increase compared to the same period last year. This growth was largely driven by advertising revenue, which grew by 45% year-over-year.\n\nChallenges Twitter Faces in Generating Revenue\n\nTwitter faces several challenges when it comes to generating revenue. Here are some of the most significant challenges:\n\n1. User Growth: Twitter\u2019s user growth has been sluggish in recent years. While it has over 330 million monthly active users, this pales in comparison to other social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, which have over 2 billion and 1 billion users, respectively. The slower user growth makes it harder for Twitter to generate advertising revenue.\n\n2. Advertiser Satisfaction: Twitter needs to ensure that advertisers are satisfied with the advertising solutions it offers. If advertisers don\u2019t see a good return on investment, they are unlikely to continue advertising on the platform, which will impact Twitter\u2019s revenue.\n\n3. Competition: Twitter faces stiff competition from other social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. These platforms offer similar advertising solutions and have larger user bases, making it harder for Twitter to attract and retain advertisers.\n\nConclusion\n\nTwitter has evolved from a simple platform for sharing thoughts and updates to a powerful social media platform for businesses, influencers, and individuals. Twitter\u2019s business model is based on advertising, which accounts for 85% of its total revenue. Twitter\u2019s advertising solutions include promoted tweets, accounts, trends, and video ads.\n\nApart from advertising, Twitter generates revenue from data licensing and MoPub. While Twitter\u2019s revenue growth has been impressive, it faces significant challenges in generating revenue, including user growth, advertiser satisfaction, and competition.\n\nDespite these challenges, Twitter remains a valuable platform for businesses and individuals looking to connect with their audience in real-time. As Twitter continues to evolve and introduce new advertising solutions, it is likely to remain a popular platform for years to come."}]}, {"facetValue": "write a 2000-word blog article on how banks make money.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "act as a professional SEO content writer and create a 2000-word article on how banks make money."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "write a 2000-word blog article on how banks make money."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "I want you to act as a professional SEO content writer.

We deposit our money there, get loans, and manage our transactions. But have you ever thought about how banks make money? The answer is not as simple as it looks.\n\nIn this article, we will delve deeper into how banks make money, their profit sources, and the different financial activities they undertake to keep their businesses afloat.\n\nHere's a quick breakdown of what we'll cover:\n\n1. How Banks Operate\n2. Main Sources of Bank Revenues\n3. How Banks Earn Interest\n4. Charging Fees and Commissions\n5. Selling Financial Products\n6. Investing in Stock Markets\n7. Is Banking Profitable?\n8. Conclusion\n\nSo let's dive in!\n\nHow Banks Operate\n\nIn its simplest definition, a bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from customers, loans money to them, and performs other financial services. Banks earn money by charging interest on the loans they make and by collecting fees for services rendered.\n\nThe way banks make money is through the concept of fractional-reserve banking. This means that banks do not keep all the funds deposited by customers in their possession. Instead, they use the funds to create more loans and to invest in other businesses. Banks maintain a specific amount of reserve, which is regulated by the government, to ensure that they have enough cash on hand.\n\nMain Sources of Bank Revenues\n\nBanks have multiple sources of revenue, which include:\n\n1. Interest on Loans - Banks earn most of their revenue from interest on loans. When a customer borrows money, the bank charges an interest rate on the loan, which is a percentage of the borrowed amount. The interest rate charged by banks varies according to the type of loan and the credit risk of the customer.\n\n2. Fees and Commissions - Banks charge various fees for their services, such as account maintenance fees, overdraft fees, and transfer fees. Some banks also earn commissions from their customers for selling financial products such as insurance, mutual funds, and credit cards.\n\n3. Financial Products - Bank earns money by investing in financial products like bonds and stocks. Banks also make money by selling these financial products to their customers.\n\n4. Stock Market - Banks invest in the stock market and earn a profit from the dividends paid on the stocks. They also buy and sell stocks, earning a profit through price fluctuations.\n\nHow Banks Earn Interest\n\nWhen a bank lends money to someone, it earns interest on the loan. The amount of interest charged will vary depending on the type of loan and the creditworthiness of the borrower. For example, a personal loan will generally have a higher interest rate than a mortgage loan.\n\nIn addition to loans, banks also earn interest from the reserve deposits that they hold with the central bank. These reserve deposits are mandated by the government to ensure that banks have enough cash on hand to meet the needs of their customers.\n\nCharging Fees and Commissions\n\nBanks charge various fees for their services. Account maintenance fees, overdraft fees, and transaction fees are a few examples. The fees charged by banks vary widely and depend on the type of account and the services used.\n\nIn addition to fees, banks also earn commissions from selling financial products. For example, if you buy an insurance policy from your bank, the bank will receive a commission from the insurance company.\n\nSelling Financial Products\n\nBanks also make money by selling financial products to their customers. These products include mutual funds, insurance policies, and credit cards. When customers buy these products, banks earn a commission from the product providers.\n\nInvesting in Stock Markets\n\nBanks invest in the stock market to earn a profit. They use their own funds to buy stocks, and the profits earned from selling these stocks are a significant source of revenue for banks.\n\nIs Banking Profitable?\n\nYes, banking can be highly profitable when done correctly.

But how do they make money? While it may be difficult to see how a simple checking account can generate revenue for banks, the fact is that banks earn billions of dollars every year by leveraging billions of dollars in assets from customer deposits, loans, and other activities. In this article, we will explore the various ways in which banks make money and the challenges and criticisms they face.\n\nDeposits\nThe primary source of income for banks is deposits. When you deposit money in the bank, the institution can use those funds to make more money through loans and investments. Banks compete with each other to offer the most attractive interest rates on savings and checking accounts, with higher rates offering more incentives for people to deposit money. By leveraging these deposits, banks make money through the difference between the interest they pay on deposits and the interest they earn on loans and investments.\n\nLoans\nAnother significant source of income for banks is loans. Banks offer a wide range of loans, including personal loans, mortgages, business loans, and more. Banks determine the interest rates on loans based on a range of factors, including credit score, credit history, and other criteria. The interest rates charged on loans reflect the risk associated with lending money, and banks generate revenue from the difference between the interest rate charged on the loan and the cost of funding that loan. Additionally, banks generate more income through late fees, penalties, and other charges associated with loans.\n\nTrading and Investments\nBanks also earn money by investing and trading on behalf of their clients. Banks use the funds from the deposits of their clients to purchase stocks, bonds, and other securities. They also engage in proprietary trading and investments for their own accounts to generate revenue. However, trading and investing activities can be risky and can lead to significant losses for banks, so they balance the potential rewards with the potential risks.\n\nFees\nBanks charge a variety of fees to their customers, ranging from overdraft fees to ATM fees to transaction fees. While these fees can be frustrating for customers, they generate significant revenue for banks. Banks charge fees based on the services they provide, and the amount charged varies depending on the institution. Customers should always compare fees across banks to ensure they find the best product for their needs.\n\nOther Income\nBanks also generate money through other sources of income, including credit card revenue, leasing or renting bank-owned properties, and selling insurance or other financial products. These sources of income, when combined with the above sources, create a diversified revenue stream for banks.\n\nChallenges and Controversies\nWhile banks generate significant revenue, they also face challenges and controversies. Banks must abide by strict regulations and laws, which can significantly impact their operations and revenue. Additionally, banking practices can be controversial, such as deceptive marketing, lending discrimination, and other pervasive issues in the industry. These challenges result in a negative perception of banks by people.\n\nConclusion\nBanks make money through a variety of means, including deposits, loans, trading and investments, fees, and other income sources. Each source of income carries a distinct risk and reward for the banks that engage in it. While banks face numerous challenges and controversies, they continue to play a vital role in providing financial services to individuals and businesses alike. By understanding how banks make money, you can make more informed decisions about which financial institutions to trust with your money."}]}, {"facetValue": "generate an SEO-optimized article about how banks make money, including specific headings and internal links.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "have an expert content writer create a 3000-word article on how banks make money, with specific instructions on using short sentences, H2 and H3 headings, and incorporating given internal links."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "generate an SEO-optimized article about how banks make money, including specific headings and internal links."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "I want you to act as an expert content writer.

These fees are often waived if the customer meets specific criteria, such as maintaining a minimum balance. Banks make money from customers who don't meet these requirements.\n\n**H3: Overdraft and Insufficient Funds Fees**\n\nWhen a customer overdraws their account or has insufficient funds for a transaction, banks may charge fees. These fees, often called overdraft or insufficient funds fees, can be costly for customers but are a significant revenue source for banks.

Ma con cos\u00ec tante opzioni disponibili sul mercato, pu\u00f2 essere difficile sapere da dove cominciare. In questo articolo ti forniremo alcuni consigli utili per aiutarti a scegliere il tessuto perfetto per la tua poltrona o divano.\n\nConsidera l'uso previsto\n\nPrima di iniziare a cercare il tessuto, devi considerare come userai il divano o la poltrona. Se il tuo mobile sar\u00e0 utilizzato spesso nel corso della giornata, ti consigliamo di optare per tessuti resistenti e facili da pulire. Se invece utilizzerai il mobile solo occasionalmente, puoi scegliere tessuti pi\u00f9 delicati e raffinati.\n\nScegli lo stile giusto\n\nIl tessuto che scegli per il tuo divano o poltrona dovrebbe riflettere il tuo stile personale e l'arredamento della tua casa. Se hai un arredamento contemporaneo, ad esempio, potresti optare per un tessuto liscio e minimalista. Se invece il tuo stile \u00e8 pi\u00f9 tradizionale, potresti considerare tessuti a motivi o pi\u00f9 ricchi di texture.\n\nValuta la durata del tessuto\n\nUn tessuto resistente e di alta qualit\u00e0 \u00e8 un investimento che durer\u00e0 nel tempo. Alcuni materiali, come il cotone e la lana, sono noti per la loro durata e resistenza. Assicurati di scegliere un tessuto che sia resistente alle macchie e ai danni del sole.\n\nScegli il colore giusto\n\nIl colore del tessuto che scegli per il tuo divano o poltrona dovrebbe essere coerente con il tema della tua casa e con il tuo stile personale. Se hai una casa con colori neutri, potresti optare per un tessuto di colore vivace come un verde smeraldo o un rosso acceso. Se invece preferisci colori pi\u00f9 rilassanti, potresti considerare l'uso di tonalit\u00e0 pi\u00f9 morbide come il blu o il verde scuro.\n\nIn sintesi, scegliere il tessuto giusto per la tua poltrona o divano richiede un po' di ricerca e di pianificazione. Ma seguendo i nostri consigli, sarai in grado di trovare il tessuto perfetto per soddisfare le tue esigenze estetiche e pratiche. Si consiglia di rivolgersi a un rivenditore specializzato per avere ulteriori informazioni sulla scelta del tessuto adatto."}]}, {"facetValue": "write a news article for Zhihu about a product release

In this detailed review, we will focus exclusively on WP Engine's pricing. We will explore the positive aspects and areas where improvement can be beneficial. So, let's dive in and unravel the value behind each dollar spent on WP Engine's plans.\n\nA Closer Look at the Pricing Tiers\n\nWP Engine offers four main pricing tiers: Startup, Growth, Scale, and Custom. These plans cater to businesses of different sizes, ensuring flexibility and scalability. The pricing varies based on features, storage, bandwidth, and the number of websites you can host.\n\n1. The Startup Plan: The Perfect Fit for Small Projects\n\nPriced at $30 per month or $300 per year, the Startup plan offers a cost-effective solution for those looking to launch a single website with essential features such as 10GB storage, 50GB bandwidth, and up to 25,000 monthly visits. This plan is perfect for small-scale projects, personal websites, and startups.\n\n2. Growth Plan: Essential for Scaling Your Business\n\nIf you're planning to expand your online presence or need additional resources, the Growth plan at $115 per month or $1,200 per year provides a suitable upgrade. With the ability to host up to 10 websites, 20GB storage, 200GB bandwidth, and up to 100,000 monthly visits, this plan is excellent for growing businesses and mid-sized websites.\n\n3. The Scale Plan: For High-Traffic Websites\n\nFor high-traffic websites demanding more resources, WP Engine's Scale plan for $290 per month or $2,900 per year is an apt choice. It allows hosting of up to 30 websites, 50GB of storage, 500GB bandwidth, and up to 400,000 monthly visits \u2013 ideal for large-scale projects and e-commerce websites.\n\n4.

Moreover, incorporating domain registration within the pricing structure could provide added convenience for users.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, WP Engine's pricing stands out for its range of features and scalability that cater to businesses of varied sizes. Though there are areas for improvement, it offers a great balance between affordability and functionality.

From there, you\u2019ll find various sections like Titles & Meta, Sitemap, 404 & Redirections, and more that allow you to fine-tune your site\u2019s SEO.\n\nOne of the essential aspects of configuring Rank Math is setting up your titles and meta descriptions. It\u2019s important to include your primary target keyword in both the title and meta description while keeping them within the recommended character limits. Remember to be engaging and concise, as these snippets will appear in search engine results and can either entice or repel potential visitors.\n\nNext, ensure your sitemap is correctly set up. This XML file is vital for helping search engines crawl and index your website. Check the \u2018Sitemap\u2019 section in Rank Math settings to configure which content types and taxonomies should be included in your sitemap. It\u2019s essential to keep your sitemap updated and accurate, as this will facilitate better crawling by search engines and faster indexing of new content.\n\nLastly, don\u2019t overlook the importance of setting up redirects and monitoring 404 errors. Rank Math\u2019s \u2018404 & Redirections\u2019 section allows you to easily create and manage redirects, which is crucial for keeping your website\u2019s URLs clean and user-friendly.

on these features will\nappear in the settings for example if\nyou click on the general settings\ntake note that these are the available\nsettings we have after going through the\nsetup wizard and if we go back to the\ndashboard\nand we maybe toggle this image seo\nsettings on let's go back to the general\nsettings\nyou will see this images tab here where\nyou can configure all the settings for\nimages before we toggle the image seo on\nthere wasn't an images tab now let's go\nthrough each of these settings here for\nanalytics i will leave this towards the\nend of the video let's start with the\nLinks Configuration\ngeneral settings and links strip\ncategory base for newer sites if this is\nnot turned on i would recommend to just\nleave it as it is this is an\nirreversible action what it basically\nmeans is by default if your article is\ncategorized under a certain category the\nurl will look like this you have your\ndomain name the category for which your\narticle is categorized and then your\narticle name if you toggle this on it\nwill remove this category in between now\nif you turn this on and you suddenly\ndecide to turn it back off you are going\nto have tons of 404s if you have\nhundreds or thousands of articles so if\nthis is not turned on i'll leave it as\nit is but if it's already turned on on\nyour site don't turn it off to my\nknowledge it doesn't matter if you turn\nit on or turn it off it has no impact on\nseo whatsoever now a lot of these\noptions we have already touched based on\nthem in the setup wizard so we're gonna\nleave them as it is\nBreadcrumbs Configuration\nas for the breadcrumbs it is essentially\na trail of page links that leads to the\npage you are on for example something\nlike this you're on this page but these\nare all the previous pages that will\nlead to this page it is generally a good\nseo practice to have it but a\ncomplicated part is some teams already\nhave this functionality and if it's\nalready turned on then on rank math you\nshouldn't turn it on to cause conflict\nand some teams are not compatible with\nbreadcrumbs and turning this on it might\nbreak the site so i will not be talking\nabout this if you really want to turn\nthis on then make sure that you save a\nbackup copy of your site before turning\nImage SEO Configuration\nthis on next let's go to the image seo\nwe have just turned on i would recommend\nturning this on you know sometimes when\nwe add an image to an article we forgot\nto add an alt text here and what it does\nis it tells google what your image is\nabout have you ever used google to\nsearch for images having an alt text\nallows you to rank for keywords in the\nimage search and it boosts general seo\nas well so all images should have an alt\nattribute if you forgot to add one rank\nmath will take care of it for you if you\ntoggle this on and as for the missing\ntitle attribute i think this is kind of\nredundant because nowadays when you add\nan image to your site it comes with a\ntitle next we have the webmaster tools\nWebmaster Tools - Connecting Rank Math to Search Console\nthis is a useful tool for you to connect\nyour site to google search console and\nrankmath has made it easy for us we\ndon't have to go through the dns method\nor adding codes to your hit tag if you\ndon't know where to get this\nverification code of your search console\njust click on this\ncopy this entire code go back to rank\nmath and paste the entire code in and as\nyou save this\nwe are basically done now the only thing\nis to go back to the webmaster central\nand verify\nand we are done it's that simple\nyou can go through the process for\nothers as well if you want faster\nrankings of your article on these search\nengines i'll leave it up to you to go\nthrough the process now the robots.txt\nRobots.txt\ni'll recommend that you leave this as it\nis generally this will tell google\ncrawlers whether they should or should\nnot cross certain parts of your site\nmessing with this might cause your\nranking so don't do it as for others we\nOthers - RSS\ndon't really need to add anything to\nthis i don't even know if anybody uses\nrss anymore on their sites we have\nsocial media channels like tik tok\npinterest facebook instagram to get our\ndaily feeds so it will be more effective\nif you post your articles on those\nchannels rather than have them on your\nsite generally rss is just a medium for\nyou to notify your site visitors as\nsomething new has been published on your\nsite it used to be very popular back in\nthe day but nowadays i don't see anybody\nusing rss anymore they usually go to\nsocial media sites to get updates so\ni'll rather you update your followers\nthrough social media channels or email\nmarketing than rss feeds so we'll skip\nthis we'll talk about woocommerce in a\nHTAccess\nwhile now as for htss we will not make\nany changes to this because if you mess\naround with the codes it may break your\nwebsite so i will not do anything to\nthis let's go to 404 monitor again\n404 Monitor Configuration\nnothing much to adjust 404 monitor as\ni've mentioned it will notify you when\nyou have pages that were previously\nindexed on search engines but those\npages don't exist anymore so i'll not do\nanything to this let's go to\nRedirection Configuration - Selecting Redirection Type\nredirections now redirection is usually\nused when you delete a page or change\nthe permalink structure and for such\ncases we'll leave it as 301 permanent\nmove now let me explain a little more\nabout these options for 302 i recommend\nnot to use it as it is vague if you need\na temporary redirect where you still\nneed the original url later on for\nexample if you are building a page that\nis still under construction you will\nwant to use 307 instead of 302 when the\npage is completed you will remove the\n307. if ever your content is removed do\nnot use 410 just use 301 instead because\nit is most recognizable and if ever you\nare unlucky that your content needs to\nbe taken down by court order then you\nwill need to use 451 let's hope we never\nuse this so by default we'll keep it as\n301 but if you visit the redirections\ntab and you edit any link\nyou can amend the redirection type\nso we are basically done with the\ngeneral settings now let's go to titles\nTitles & Meta\nand meta as for the global meta we want\nGlobal Meta Configuration\nthe robot's meta to be indexed so all of\nour content and stuff will be indexed by\nsearch engines the advanced robots meta\nwe want to keep it as it is negative one\nbasically tells google that you can use\nall the content on the article to be\nused as a snippet or they can use all\nthe content in the video as a preview so\nthere are no restrictions however if you\nin fact change this number you are\nrestricting google crawlers so generally\nwe want to leave this as negative one\nthis is done on the setup wizard and as\nfor the separator character this is by\npreference just take a look at the\nsymbol here as i change the separators\nyou basically change the look of it on\nsearch results personally i like this\nand if you want to capitalize the first\ncharacter of all title tags you can do\nso by toggling this on i choose to leave\nit to give me more flexibility\nand if you want to add a fallback image\nto be displayed on facebook in case you\nforgot to add a featured image you can\ndo so here and this is self-explanatory\nLocal SEO Configuration\nalright let's go to local seo as you\nknow these are the information we have\ndone on the setup wizard but this is\nespecially important for local\nbusinesses and there are more settings\nhere if you toggle this on\nlet's go back to the page and refresh\nand you'll see there are a lot more\ndetails you can add you can add your\nemail address your business address your\nbusiness type which was set in the setup\nwizard you can add the opening hours\ndesign on the time format\nyour phone number price range set your\nabout page contact page google maps if\nyou don't know the api key just click on\nthis link to get it and if you know the\ncoordinates of your business location\nyou can add it here so these are all the\ninformation you can give to google so\nthat they can display something like\nthis on their search results in case\npeople are searching for your business\nthey will know the opening hours and how\nto contact you these are important\ninformation for your customers so please\ndon't neglect this for local businesses\nbut for my case this is a blog so i\nwon't be needing this let me toggle this\noff\nand let's hit\nrefresh and all those settings are gone\nSocial Meta Configuration\nas for the social meta this is for you\nto connect your facebook and twitter you\ncan add your facebook page url here for\nmy case this is the facebook page i'll\nleave all this as it is but feel free to\ngo through the links to get the user id\nthe app id and the secret id all this\nwill give you a very nice facebook post\ndisplay instead of the ugly looking ones\nlike this\nand then as for twitter you can add just\nthe username and that's it i don't have\na twitter account for this site so i'll\nleave it as it is now let's go to the\nOptimizing Home Page for SEO\nhome page\nessentially it is telling you to go to\nthe settings and under reading they want\nyou to define your home page and if you\nwant to optimize this page for seo you\nneed to go to that particular page\nfor my case it is this home page let's\nedit this\nand you want to optimize this page for\nseo so currently on the search result it\nwill look like this doesn't look really\nnice let's edit snippets and over here i\ndon't really care if the title is\nshowing so let me remove this and let me\nremove this as well\nand as for this separator let me cut\nthis off and let me paste it here and\nthen let me add something like the\ntagline\nso something like this now it'll look\nmuch better on search engine now this\nsite name you can basically find it on\nthe settings and general which is over\nhere\nthis code is actually drawing\ninformation from this view so if i\nchange the site title\nthis will change as well just take note\nof that and as for the description let\nme type something in\nso something like this\nlet's close this off and then as for the\nfocus keyword\nlet's just optimize for the brand name\nyou see over here it is recommending us\nto add echo tarot in the meta\ndescription so let's do that i've typed\nin some text so i'll place it here this\nis too long let us do something about\nthis\nand done\nlet us close this off and we see a\nlittle green tick here\nas for this\nlet us do something like this\nand we are basically done we are all\ngood let's update this\nand we have basically optimized the home\npage for seo now let's get back to the\nrank map dashboard and under titles and\nmeta let's continue on with the authors\nAuthor Archive Configuration\nnow if your site only has one author\nwhich is yourself then you want to\ndisable this but if your site has more\nthan one writer you need to enable this\nand to avoid duplicate content you\nshould put a note index on auto archives\nwhich rank mav has already done so by\ndefault\nnow we have gone through all this and\nthis is how it looks like on search\nresults for the author archive you can\nleave it as it is or you can change it\nto something like\narticles written by the author name\nwhich is symbolized by this and you can\nchange this to something like this\narticles written by author name of the\nsite name and then we have the page\nwhich is this and that's basically it\nlet's save changes and let's go to the\nMisc Pages\nmiscellaneous pages this is where you\ncustomize the date archives\nthe 404 page just like how you will\ncustomize the author archives this is\nhow the 404 looks like it really depends\non how you would want to display your\nphoto for i'll leave all this as it is\nbut you definitely want to toggle this\non in case you have any paid content on\nthe site you don't want those pages to\nbe indexed on search engines you want to\nkeep them private and then we're going\nto save changes\nPost Types - Posts\nnow the post types i think the default\nsettings from rankmath is good enough\nbut if you want to further customize it\nfor example if you want to add a current\nyear so that if you go to google for\nexample you have this 2021 in the seo\ntitle but if you take a look at this\nthis is written in 2019 so you can\nbasically display the current year in\nthe search results and the reason\nbloggers do this is because it gives the\nimpression that this article is current\nthis is debatable i see some big sites\ndoing this if you want to do this as\nwell on a single post title you can add\nfor example open and close brackets and\nwithin that\nlet's search for\ncurrent year\nthis is the code let's cut this and\npaste this inside the bracket now the\ntitle is too long so let me bring this\nforward so you can see how it looks like\nso it's something like this\nbut i want to put it right before the\nseparator now if you do this all your\nposts will now have this current year on\nthe search results but if you don't want\nto do that for all of your posts you\nshould remove this and you'll do the\nmanual customization here for example\nthis so let's continue i'll leave all\nthis as it is to give my articles more\nflexibility if i want to change the seo\ntitle and description i will go straight\nto the specific post and page to edit\nthe snippet instead of doing them here\nnow this schema type is done on the\nsetup wizard and the rest are quite\nstandard i'm sure you know what this is\nalready and as for the custom fields\nwe'll talk more about this in the\nwoocommerce section because we'll be\nswitching to another site as a reference\nnow there are a lot of seo strategies to\ntackle this you have probably hear a lot\nof people talking about this and there\nis really no right or wrong answer the\nkey is really to write the best content\nhave the best headline that attracts the\nright audience and that's the general\nrule of time for seo now as for the\nPost Types - Pages\npages\nit is going to be the same as well\ntypically i wouldn't add the year to\npages because usually they are static\nPost Types - Attachments\nand as for the attachments we have\nbasically set this in the seo wizard and\nPost Types - Elements\nfor the elements i use elements as\ndesign templates so i do not want this\nto be indexed so that's basically the\nsettings i will need and for the\nproducts they are basically the same all\nthese are quite standard and we have\ndiscussed about customizing this now\nPost Categories SEO Configuration\nlet's talk about categories i want to\nmake sure that categories are not\nindexed because it might cause google to\nview it as duplicate content so if you\ndo not have this turned on you want to\ndo so and you want to select no index\nthe same goes for text\ni want to put a no index to text and\nlet's save changes and we are basically\ndone with the titles and meta now let us\nAdding Sitemap to Google Search Console\nadd sitemaps sitemap is a guide for\ngoogle robots to navigate through your\nsite to easily find all the pages and\nposts and rankmath has created the\nsitemap for you and this is the link you\nneed to copy this and then you need to\ngo to google search console and you need\nto go to sitemaps and paste in the link\nyou need to remove all this\nand let's submit\nand great it is successful search\nconsole will tell you if the status is\nsuccessful and it will show you how many\npages of posts they have indexed and\nthere we go we are 95 done with the\noptimization the rest of the five\npercent comes from the customization of\nyour single post articles and all these\nwe have basically covered them earlier\nWooCommerce & ACF Configuration\nnow let's talk about woocommerce and\nthis acf now we are on my other side\nwhere i use it to do woocommerce\ntutorials you see i've created a single\nproduct template like this where all\nthis information are drawn from these\ncustom fields and these custom fields\nbasically came from a plugin called\nadvanced custom fields by delicious\nbrains and i've created this view group\nwhere all these custom fields will be\ndisplayed on products under the knife\ncategory you'll see all these fields\nright here in the single product page it\nsounds complicated but it's actually\nquite simple if you are curious how i\ncreated this single product template you\ncan watch this video at the top right\ncorner i've left the link in the\ndescription as well\nso basically if you toggle this\nwoocommerce feature on what it does is\non the single product page as you scroll\nall the way to the bottom you will see\nthis section where it says rank math seo\nand this is where you optimize this\nsingle product for search engines so for\nexample the focus keyword will be the\nname of the knife and now we have a\nscore of 54. now here's the interesting\nthing as you can see here content should\nbe 600 words to 2500 words which means\ncurrently all this content that i've\nwritten over here in the custom fields\nare not taken into account and rank math\nso what we need to do is to go back to\nthe rank map dashboard and over at this\nacf feature we need to turn this on and\nimmediately after that if we go back to\nthe single product page and we refresh\nnow as we scroll down all the way to\nwhere the rank math is\nyou will see now it has detected 74\nwords and these came from the custom\nfields\nand before we activated the acf feature\nrankmap did not pick up any content\nbecause the product description as well\nas the product shop description are\nbasically left blank so that's all we\nneed to know about acf and woocommerce\nin rankmath if you have activated the\nProduct Post Type Configuration\nwoocommerce feature you'll have this\nproduct post time here or you can\ncustomize the single product title\nand as you know the more customized this\nis the more restriction it's going to be\non your individual products so it's\nreally up to you whether you want to\nspend time customizing this i feel that\ntime will be better spent if you\noptimize for seo on the product page\nitself rather than here but this is just\nfor you to know you have all these\noptions to customize for your product\npost type and the other settings that\nProduct Categories & Tags Configuration\nare available when you have activated\nthe woocommerce feature as this product\ncategories that work similar to the post\ncategories and tags you can make the\nproduct categories no index and you can\ndo the same with product tags and that's\nwhat you basically need to know and now\nConnecting Rank Math to Google Analytics\nthere is one last thing we need to do\nwhich is to connect your website to\ngoogle analytics now we are back on the\neco tarot website and i've opened up my\ngoogle analytics and now let us connect\nthrough the usual way by clicking on\nthis button and let's select the google\nanalytics account\nyou want to check all these boxes and\nlet's continue\nand now the thing is as you can see the\nanalytics is not sync if they are in\nsync it will have a green dot here\ninstead of red so if we go to the\ngeneral settings and we select analytics\nwe can see over here under the account\nwe can select ecotaro and under the\nproperty we have no other options it's\nsupposed to show\nthe property here so how do we solve\nthis this is a very common issue if you\ndon't set up the property that allows\nuniversal data\nso let's go to admin\nand let's create a new property\nlet us give this property a name\nas for me i live in singapore so i'll\nrather have the data served to me in my\ntime zone currency i'll leave it as us\ndollars and you need to open this\nadvanced options up and over here you\ncan see universal analytics property\nlet's toggle this on\nnow over here\nyou want to put in your website url and\nmake sure you select this as well as\nchecking this box\nand let's click next\nselect an industry\nfor me i'll select home and garden and\nthe business size or select small but\nyou can select whatever that suits your\nbusiness and then i'll check whatever\nthat applies to my business\nincrease my conversion\nmeasure content monetization this as\nwell as this now let's create the\nproperty\nand here we go we are done let's go back\nto our site and let's refresh this\nlet us go back to analytics\nnow let's select an account and we have\nthe new property here let's select this\nand let's select all website data\nand let's save changes and once that's\ndone you can see this little dot has\nturned green and that's what you need to\ndo to connect to google analytics all\nyou need is just the universal analytics\ndata if you have an existing property\ncreate a new one it doesn't hurt now\noverall ranked math is a very powerful\nseo tool

Now create an outline using the following transcript: rank math\ndashboard as you can see these are all\nthe functions that you have on the free\nversion of rank math and depending on\nwhat you toggle on these features will\nappear in the settings for example if\nyou click on the general settings\ntake note that these are the available\nsettings we have after going through the\nsetup wizard and if we go back to the\ndashboard\nand we maybe toggle this image seo\nsettings on let's go back to the general\nsettings\nyou will see this images tab here where\nyou can configure all the settings for\nimages before we toggle the image seo on\nthere wasn't an images tab now let's go\nthrough each of these settings here for\nanalytics i will leave this towards the\nend of the video let's start with the\nLinks Configuration\ngeneral settings and links strip\ncategory base for newer sites if this is\nnot turned on i would recommend to just\nleave it as it is this is an\nirreversible action what it basically\nmeans is by default if your article is\ncategorized under a certain category the\nurl will look like this you have your\ndomain name the category for which your\narticle is categorized and then your\narticle name if you toggle this on it\nwill remove this category in between now\nif you turn this on and you suddenly\ndecide to turn it back off you are going\nto have tons of 404s if you have\nhundreds or thousands of articles so if\nthis is not turned on i'll leave it as\nit is but if it's already turned on on\nyour site don't turn it off to my\nknowledge it doesn't matter if you turn\nit on or turn it off it has no impact on\nseo whatsoever now a lot of these\noptions we have already touched based on\nthem in the setup wizard so we're gonna\nleave them as it is\nBreadcrumbs Configuration\nas for the breadcrumbs it is essentially\na trail of page links that leads to the\npage you are on for example something\nlike this you're on this page but these\nare all the previous pages that will\nlead to this page it is generally a good\nseo practice to have it but a\ncomplicated part is some teams already\nhave this functionality and if it's\nalready turned on then on rank math you\nshouldn't turn it on to cause conflict\nand some teams are not compatible with\nbreadcrumbs and turning this on it might\nbreak the site so i will not be talking\nabout this if you really want to turn\nthis on then make sure that you save a\nbackup copy of your site before turning\nImage SEO Configuration\nthis on next let's go to the image seo\nwe have just turned on i would recommend\nturning this on you know sometimes when\nwe add an image to an article we forgot\nto add an alt text here and what it does\nis it tells google what your image is\nabout have you ever used google to\nsearch for images having an alt text\nallows you to rank for keywords in the\nimage search and it boosts general seo\nas well so all images should have an alt\nattribute if you forgot to add one rank\nmath will take care of it for you if you\ntoggle this on and as for the missing\ntitle attribute i think this is kind of\nredundant because nowadays when you add\nan image to your site it comes with a\ntitle next we have the webmaster tools\nWebmaster Tools - Connecting Rank Math to Search Console\nthis is a useful tool for you to connect\nyour site to google search console and\nrankmath has made it easy for us we\ndon't have to go through the dns method\nor adding codes to your hit tag if you\ndon't know where to get this\nverification code of your search console\njust click on this\ncopy this entire code go back to rank\nmath and paste the entire code in and as\nyou save this\nwe are basically done now the only thing\nis to go back to the webmaster central\nand verify\nand we are done it's that simple\nyou can go through the process for\nothers as well if you want faster\nrankings of your article on these search\nengines i'll leave it up to you to go\nthrough the process now the robots.txt\nRobots.txt\ni'll recommend that you leave this as it\nis generally this will tell google\ncrawlers whether they should or should\nnot cross certain parts of your site\nmessing with this might cause your\nranking so don't do it as for others we\nOthers - RSS\ndon't really need to add anything to\nthis i don't even know if anybody uses\nrss anymore on their sites we have\nsocial media channels like tik tok\npinterest facebook instagram to get our\ndaily feeds so it will be more effective\nif you post your articles on those\nchannels rather than have them

on facebook in case you\nforgot to add a featured image you can\ndo so here and this is self-explanatory\nLocal SEO Configuration\nalright let's go to local seo as you\nknow these are the information we have\ndone on the setup wizard but this is\nespecially important for local\nbusinesses and there are more settings\nhere if you toggle this on\nlet's go back to the page and refresh\nand you'll see

have\na twitter account for this site so i'll\nleave it as it is now let's go to the\nOptimizing Home Page for SEO\nhome page\nessentially it is telling you to go to\nthe settings and under reading they want\nyou to define your home page and if you\nwant to optimize this page for seo you\nneed to go to that particular page\nfor my case it is this home page let's\nedit this\nand you want to optimize this page for\nseo so currently on the search result it\nwill look like this doesn't look really\nnice let's edit snippets and over here i\ndon't really care if the title is\nshowing so let me remove this and let me\nremove this as well\nand as for this separator let me cut\nthis off and let me paste it here and\nthen let me add something like the\ntagline\nso something like this now it'll look\nmuch better on search engine now this\nsite name you can basically find it on\nthe settings and general which is over\nhere\nthis code is actually drawing\ninformation from this view so if i\nchange the site title\nthis will change as well just take note\nof that and as for the description let\nme type something in\nso something like this\nlet's close this off and then as for the\nfocus keyword\nlet's just optimize for the brand name\nyou see over here it is recommending us\nto add echo tarot in the meta\ndescription so let's do that i've typed\nin some text so i'll place it here this\nis too long let us do something about\nthis\nand done\nlet us close this off and we see a\nlittle green tick here\nas for this\nlet us do something like this\nand we are basically done we are all\ngood let's update this\nand we have basically optimized the home\npage for seo now let's get back to the\nrank map dashboard and under titles and\nmeta let's continue on with the authors\nAuthor Archive Configuration\nnow if your site only has one author\nwhich is yourself then you want to\ndisable this but if your site has more\nthan one writer you need to enable this\nand to avoid duplicate content you\nshould put a note index on auto archives\nwhich rank mav has already done so by\ndefault\nnow we have gone through all this and\nthis is how it looks like on search\nresults for the author archive you can\nleave it as it is or you can change it\nto something like\narticles written by the author name\nwhich is symbolized by this and you can\nchange this to something like this\narticles written by author name of the\nsite name and then we have the page\nwhich is this and that's basically it\nlet's save changes and let's go to the\nMisc Pages\nmiscellaneous pages this is where you\ncustomize the date archives\nthe 404 page just like how you will\ncustomize the author archives this is\nhow the 404 looks like it really depends\non how you would want to display your\nphoto for i'll leave all this as it is\nbut you definitely want to toggle this\non in case you have any paid content on\nthe site you don't want those pages to\nbe indexed on search engines you want to\nkeep them private and then we're going\nto save changes\nPost Types - Posts\nnow the post types i think the default\nsettings from rankmath is good enough\nbut if you want to further customize it\nfor example if you want to add a current\nyear so that if you go to google for\nexample you have this 2021 in the seo\ntitle but if you take a look at this\nthis is written in 2019 so you can\nbasically display the current year in\nthe search results and the reason\nbloggers do this is because it gives the\nimpression that this article is current\nthis is debatable i see some big sites\ndoing this if you want to do this as\nwell on a single post title you can add\nfor example open and close brackets and\nwithin that\nlet's search for\ncurrent year\nthis is the code let's cut this and\npaste this inside the bracket now the\ntitle is too long so let me bring this\nforward so you can see how it looks like\nso it's something like this\nbut i want to put it right before the\nseparator now if you do this all your\nposts will now have this current year on\nthe search results but if you don't want\nto do that for all of your posts you\nshould remove this and you'll do the\nmanual customization here for example\nthis so let's continue i'll leave all\nthis as it is to give my articles more\nflexibility if i want to change the seo\ntitle and description i will go straight\nto the specific post and page to edit\nthe snippet instead of doing them here\nnow this schema type is done on the\nsetup wizard and the rest are quite\nstandard i'm sure you know what this is\nalready and as for the custom fields\nwe'll talk more about this in the\nwoocommerce section because we'll be\nswitching to another site as a reference\nnow there are a lot of seo strategies to\ntackle this you have probably hear a lot\nof people talking about this and there\nis really no right or wrong answer the\nkey is really to write the best content\nhave the best headline that attracts the\nright audience and that's the general\nrule of time for seo now as for the\nPost Types - Pages\npages\nit is going to be the same as well\ntypically i wouldn't add the year to\npages because usually they are static\nPost Types - Attachments\nand as for the attachments we have\nbasically set this in the seo wizard and\nPost Types - Elements\nfor the elements i use elements as\ndesign templates so i do not want this\nto be indexed so that's basically the\nsettings i will need and for the\nproducts they are basically the same all\nthese are quite standard and we have\ndiscussed about customizing this now\nPost Categories SEO Configuration\nlet's talk about categories i want to\nmake sure that categories are not\nindexed because it might cause google to\nview it as duplicate content so if you\ndo not have this turned on you want to\ndo so and you want to select no index\nthe same goes for text\ni want to put a no index to text and\nlet's save changes and we are basically\ndone with the titles and meta now let us\nAdding Sitemap to Google Search Console\nadd sitemaps sitemap is a guide for\ngoogle robots to navigate through your\nsite to easily find all the pages and\nposts and rankmath has created the\nsitemap for you and this is the link you\nneed to copy this and then you need to\ngo to google search console and you need\nto go to sitemaps and paste in the link\nyou need to remove all this\nand let's submit\nand great it is successful search\nconsole will tell you if the status is\nsuccessful and it will show you how many\npages of posts they have indexed and\nthere we go we are 95 done with the\noptimization the rest of the five\npercent comes from the customization of\nyour single post articles and all these\nwe have basically covered them earlier\nWooCommerce & ACF Configuration\nnow let's talk about woocommerce and\nthis acf now we are on my other side\nwhere i use it to do woocommerce\ntutorials you see i've created a single\nproduct template like this where all\nthis information are drawn from these\ncustom fields and these custom fields\nbasically came from a plugin called\nadvanced custom fields by delicious\nbrains and i've created this view group\nwhere all these custom fields will be\ndisplayed on products under the knife\ncategory you'll see all these fields\nright here in the single product page it\nsounds complicated but it's actually\nquite simple if you are curious how i\ncreated this single product template you\ncan watch this video at the top right\ncorner i've left the link in the\ndescription as well\nso basically if you toggle this\nwoocommerce feature on what it does is\non the single product page as you scroll\nall the way to the bottom you will see\nthis section where it says rank math seo\nand this is where you optimize this\nsingle product for search engines so for\nexample the focus keyword will be the\nname of the knife and now we have a\nscore of 54. now here's the interesting\nthing as you can see here content should\nbe 600 words to 2500 words which means\ncurrently all this content that i've\nwritten over here in the custom fields\nare not taken into account and rank math\nso what we need to do is to go back to\nthe rank map dashboard and over at this\nacf feature we need to turn this on and\nimmediately after that if we go back to\nthe single product page and we refresh\nnow as we scroll down all the way to\nwhere the rank math is\nyou will see now it has detected 74\nwords and these came from the custom\nfields\nand before we activated the acf feature\nrankmap did not pick up any content\nbecause the product description as well\nas the product shop description are\nbasically left blank so that's all we\nneed to know about acf and woocommerce\nin rankmath if you have activated the\nProduct Post Type Configuration\nwoocommerce feature you'll have this\nproduct post time here or you can\ncustomize the single product title\nand as you know the more customized this\nis the more restriction it's going to be\non your individual products so it's\nreally up to you whether you want to\nspend time customizing this i feel that\ntime will be better spent if you\noptimize for seo on the product page\nitself rather than here but this is just\nfor you to know you have all these\noptions to customize for your product\npost type and the other settings that\nProduct Categories & Tags Configuration\nare available when you have activated\nthe woocommerce feature as this product\ncategories that work similar to the post\ncategories and tags you can make the\nproduct categories no index and you can\ndo the same with product tags and that's\nwhat you basically need to know and now\nConnecting Rank Math to Google Analytics\nthere is one last thing we need to do\nwhich is to connect your website to\ngoogle analytics now we are back on the\neco tarot website and i've opened up my\ngoogle analytics and now let us connect\nthrough the usual way by clicking on\nthis button and let's select the google\nanalytics account\nyou want to check all these boxes and\nlet's continue\nand now the thing is as you can see the\nanalytics is not sync if they are in\nsync it will have a green dot here\ninstead of red so if we go to the\ngeneral settings and we select analytics\nwe can see over here under the account\nwe can select ecotaro and under the\nproperty we have no other options it's\nsupposed to show\nthe property here so how do we solve\nthis this is a very common issue if you\ndon't set up the property that allows\nuniversal data\nso let's go to admin\nand let's create a new property\nlet us give this property a name\nas for me i live in singapore so i'll\nrather have the data served to me in my\ntime zone currency i'll leave it as us\ndollars and you need to open this\nadvanced options up and over here you\ncan see universal analytics property\nlet's toggle this on\nnow over here\nyou want to put in your website url and\nmake sure you select this as well as\nchecking this box\nand let's click next\nselect an industry\nfor me i'll select home and garden and\nthe business size or select small but\nyou can select whatever that suits your\nbusiness and then i'll check whatever\nthat applies to my business\nincrease my conversion\nmeasure content monetization this as\nwell as this now let's create the\nproperty\nand here we go we are done let's go back\nto our site and let's refresh this\nlet us go back to analytics\nnow let's select an account and we have\nthe new property here let's select this\nand let's select all website data\nand let's save changes and once that's\ndone you can see this little dot has\nturned green and that's what you need to\ndo to connect to google analytics all\nyou need is just the universal analytics\ndata if you have an existing property\ncreate a new one it doesn't hurt now\noverall ranked math is a very powerful\nseo tool that will help your site\noptimize for major search engines it\nprovides you with a ton of features that\nno other seo plugins provide and the\nbest thing about this is that it is free\nnow ranked math has a pro version that\ncosts 59 per year and you can install it\non unlimited websites\nand it offers you a lot more\nfunctionalities\nnow if you decide to upgrade to the pro\nversion i hope you can use this link\ni've left the link in the description as\nwell and full disclaimer i do make a\nsmall commission if you use the link to\nmake a purchase and don't worry it will\nnot cost you anything more if you get\nranked math pro directly from the site"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Outline:\n\nI.

It is a system that enables you to create well-organized notes in a way that\u2019s flexible and dynamic. Zettelkasten originated from a German word that means \u201cbox of index cards\u201d.\n\nZettelkasten can help you transform the way you take notes by allowing you to create a network of interconnected notes which can be quickly accessed whilst being well-organized. The interconnected notes translate large amounts of information into a more comprehensive and understandable format.\n\nThe key principle of Zettelkasten is that each note is supposed to be a self-contained idea. This means that each note contains one valuable piece of information that is relevant and can be used to generate more information at a later time. By having a clear and concise note, you can build up a library of self-contained ideas that can be used to connect with other ideas at a later time.\n\nObsidian is a powerful note-taking app that is optimized for Zettelkasten. Obsidian boasts of being a text editor that links the notes you write to create a web of thoughts and ideas.
