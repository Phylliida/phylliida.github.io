Setting up SSH is essential for remote administration of your server. You would not need to log in manually at the machine each time, as you can access the server remotely via SSH.\n\n3. To power up the machine remotely, you can use the Wake-on-LAN (WoL) feature, which requires enabling it on both the server's BIOS/UEFI and the operating system. To power it down remotely, you can use the `sudo poweroff` or `sudo shutdown` commands via SSH.\n\n4.

Once the scripts are on your server, you can run them remotely via SSH by calling \"python script.py\" or similar command.\n\n5. To make it a web application, consider using Python web frameworks like Flask, Django, or FastAPI. They allow you to create a web server that listens on a specific port and handles incoming requests. For example, in Flask, you can define routes and their corresponding actions, including functions that call your AI models.\n\n6. Gradio can help you create an interface with its easy-to-use components. First, set up your model and inference functions, then wrap them with Gradio functions to enable a web-based UI. Gradio will host the interface on a local port, and you can access it from your phone or other devices.

It supports various network protocols, including SSH, Telnet, rlogin, SCP, and raw socket connections. PuTTY allows you to connect to and manage remote systems using a graphical interface.\n- **Plink**: A companion command-line utility for PuTTY, providing the same SSH functionality as PuTTY without the graphical interface. Plink is useful when you need to automate SSH connections in scripts, like the .bat file we discussed earlier.\n\nWakeMeOnLan.exe is a command-line utility that sends Wake-on-LAN packets to remote systems in your network, causing them to power on if they support WoL. The process of sending these packets needs some specific network settings and packet structures, which WakeMeOnLan conveniently handles for you. It simplifies the task of waking up your remote systems without dealing with low-level network programming.\n\nWhile it's possible to send WoL packets manually using tools like PowerShell or third-party libraries, using WakeMeOnLan simplifies the process and saves time.

To ensure that your code can be reliably transferred and run on the Ubuntu Server, you can use virtual environments.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to do this using `conda`:\n\n1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) on your Windows PC.\n\n2. Open Anaconda Prompt (or your command prompt) and create a new conda environment:\n\n```\nconda create --name my_gradio_env python=3.9\n```\n\nReplace `my_gradio_env` with the name of the environment you prefer.\n\n3. Activate the new environment:\n\n```\nconda activate my_gradio_env\n```\n\n4. Install Gradio and other required packages in the environment:\n\n```\nconda install gradio -c conda-forge\n```\n\n5. Open Visual Studio Code, and in the Terminal, make sure you are in the `my_gradio_env` conda environment. You can activate it in VSCode terminal using the same command as in step 3.\n\n6. Develop your Gradio application and inference functions within this environment, testing them as necessary.\n\n7. Once you have completed development, export the environment's package list into a `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` file:\n\n```\nconda env export > environment.yml\n```\n\nor\n\n```\npip freeze > requirements.txt\n```\n\n8. Transfer your code and the `environment.yml` (or `requirements.txt`) file to the Ubuntu Server using SCP, SFTP, or any other file transfer method.\n\n9.

Run your Gradio application and inference functions in the conda environment on the Ubuntu Server.\n\nUsing this approach ensures that your application's dependencies are consistent between your development computer and the server. Docker is an alternative option, but you're right that it may come with some performance overhead. In most cases, using conda environments will provide an efficient and reliable solution for managing dependencies across platforms."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Absolutely amazing. Can you please also clarify the difference between Anaconda and Miniconda?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Anaconda and Miniconda are both open-source distribution of Python and serve as package managers, providing easy ways to manage Python environments and packages. However, they have some differences in terms of preinstalled packages and size:\n\n**Anaconda:**\n\n- Anaconda includes a large number of preinstalled packages (over 150) for scientific computing, data analysis, machine learning, and more. These packages are curated to meet the requirements of a wide range of users and use cases.\n- It comes with the conda package manager, which allows you to easily create and manage Python environments, install new packages, and update existing ones.\n- The distribution is larger in size (~3 GB for the full installation) due to the preinstalled packages.\n\n**Miniconda:**\n\n- Miniconda is a minimal distribution, containing only the Python interpreter and the conda package manager. No additional packages are preinstalled.\n- It is lightweight and has a much smaller size (~400 MB) compared to Anaconda.\n- As it comes with the conda package manager, you can easily create Python environments and install any packages you need on-demand.\n\nIn summary, Anaconda is suitable for users who want a comprehensive environment with a wide range of preinstalled packages for scientific computing and data analysis. Miniconda is ideal for users who prefer a minimal, lightweight distribution and want to install only the specific packages they need.\n\nBoth options allow for creating and managing custom Python environments with their own package sets, but Miniconda gives you more control over the initial installed package set and takes up less disk space. If you're not sure which one to use, starting with Miniconda is generally a safe choice, as you can always install additional packages as needed."}, {"role": "user", "content": "If I create a new environment using Anaconda, will all the packages be inside?

Can't be, right? What would the use of environments be, then(?)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When you create a new environment using Anaconda, it doesn't automatically include all of the packages from the base Anaconda distribution. Instead, it starts with a minimal environment with only a few essential packages, like `pip` and the specified version of Python. The main purpose of creating an environment is to have an isolated space where you can manage specific packages and their versions without affecting other environments or the base Anaconda distribution.\n\nFor example, if you create a new conda environment with:\n\n```\nconda create --name my_new_env python=3.8\n```\n\nThis environment will only have Python 3.8 and a few essential packages installed. You can then install specific packages using the `conda install` or `pip install` commands as needed in this new environment.\n\nTo install a specific version of a package, you can use the following command:\n\n```\nconda install package_name=version\n```\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nconda install numpy=1.20.0\n```\n\nBy using separate environments for different projects, you can manage package dependencies and avoid potential conflicts without affecting your base Anaconda distribution or other projects.

Isolation: VMs provide a greater degree of isolation compared to conda environments, as they emulate an entire operating system rather than just isolating Python packages. This means that VMs can have completely separated network configurations, system-level dependencies, and user accounts, which can be beneficial in certain scenarios.\n\n2. Testing different configurations: If you want to test your Gradio web app server on multiple Linux distributions or with different system-level configurations, VMs can help you easily set up parallel testing environments without modifying the host machine's settings.\n\n3. Resource management: Virtualization allows better control over allocated resources like CPU, RAM, and disk space for each VM. You can adjust resources according to your project's needs, helping you optimize performance and utilization of your host machine.\n\n4. Running multiple instances: If you need to run multiple instances of your Gradio web app server (for example, to serve different models, applications, or host different versions of your app), you can create multiple VMs on your host machine, each running a separate instance of your server.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that running VMs has some downsides:\n\n1. Additional overhead: Virtualization introduces some performance overhead, as the virtualization software (hypervisor) utilizes CPU, RAM, and disk space resources. Multiple VMs sharing the same host resources can potentially lead to performance degradation, especially on resource-constrained systems.\n\n2. More complexity: Managing multiple VMs can be more complex compared to managing conda environments. Installing and configuring VMs, and setting up network access can be more involved than using conda environments.\n\nIf you are working on a small project, running a Gradio web app server in a conda environment should be sufficient to meet your requirements without introducing the complexity and resource overhead of virtualization. However, if your project demands a higher level of isolation, more complex configurations, or running multiple instances with different system-level dependencies, using VMs can be a suitable solution."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, thanks!

The downloaded model files are stored in the `~/.cache/huggingface/transformers` directory on your machine.\n\nRegarding the additional `torch.load` line, it appears that the script is trying to load a different set of weights (or \"state_dict\") for the BERT model that has been saved separately (perhaps after being fine-tuned on a specific task). The `model.load_state_dict(torch.load('path/to/model_state_dict.pt'))` line replaces the original pre-trained weights with the weights saved in the specified file ('path/to/model_state_dict.pt').\n\nAs for the torch's `cuda` parameter, PyTorch uses it to specify the usage of NVIDIA GPUs for training and inference.

Avoid using default passwords and change them periodically.\n\n2. **Keep your server updated**: Regularly update your server's operating system and installed software, including security patches.\n\n3. **Limit open ports**: Minimize the number of open ports on your server, exposing only those necessary for your application to work. In your case, you may only need to open the port on which your Gradio web app is running (e.g., 5000).\n\n4. **Use a firewall**: Set up a firewall to control incoming and outgoing network traffic on your server. Configure the firewall to only allow connections from trusted IP addresses, if possible.\n\n5. **Secure your application**: Make sure your Gradio web app is secure by validating user inputs, handling exceptions, and avoiding potential issues like SQL injection and cross-site scripting.\n\n6. **Use HTTPS**: Encrypt the communication between the client and the server by configuring your server to use HTTPS. You can use a free SSL certificate provided by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and set up the HTTPS connection using [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/).\n\n7. **Back up your data**: Regularly back up your server data to protect it from potential data loss due to hardware failures, security breaches, or accidental deletion.\n\n8. **Monitor your server**: Keep an eye on your server's logs, resource usage, and network traffic for unusual activity that may indicate a security breach or attack.\n\nThese basic security measures should help you protect your server from common threats, making it safer for external access.

If you can spare a coffee, you can help to cover the API costs of developing Auto-GPT and help push the boundaries of fully autonomous AI! A full day of development can easily cost as much as $20 in API costs, which for a free project is quite limiting. Your support is greatly appreciated Development of this free, open-source project is made possible by all the contributors and sponsors.

Installation To install Auto-GPT, follow these steps: Make sure you have all the requirements above, if not, install/get them. The following commands should be executed in a CMD, Bash or Powershell window. To do this, go to a folder on your computer, click in the folder path at the top and type CMD, then press enter. Clone the repository: For this step you need Git installed, but you can just download the zip file instead by clicking the button at the top of this page \u261d\ufe0f git clone https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT.git Navigate to the project directory: (Type this into your CMD window, you're aiming to navigate the CMD window to the repository you just downloaded) cd 'Auto-GPT' Install the required dependencies: (Again, type this into your CMD window) pip install -r requirements.txt Rename .env.template to .env and fill in your OPENAI_API_KEY. If you plan to use Speech Mode, fill in your ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY as well. Obtain your OpenAI API key from: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys. Obtain your ElevenLabs API key from: https://elevenlabs.io. You can view your xi-api-key using the \"Profile\" tab on the website. If you want to use GPT on an Azure instance, set USE_AZURE to True and then: Rename azure.yaml.template to azure.yaml and provide the relevant azure_api_base, azure_api_version and all of the deployment ids for the relevant models in the azure_model_map section: fast_llm_model_deployment_id - your gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4 deployment id smart_llm_model_deployment_id - your gpt-4 deployment id embedding_model_deployment_id - your text-embedding-ada-002 v2 deployment id Please specify all of these values as double quoted strings details can be found here: https://pypi.org/project/openai/ in the Microsoft Azure Endpoints section and here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/tutorials/embeddings?tabs=command-line for the embedding model. ?? Usage Run the autogpt Python module in your terminal: (Type this into your CMD window) python -m autogpt After each of action, enter 'y' to authorise command, 'y -N' to run N continuous commands, 'n' to exit program, or enter additional feedback for the AI. Logs You will find activity and error logs in the folder ./output/logs To output debug logs: python -m autogpt --debug Docker You can also build this into a docker image and run it: docker build -t autogpt . docker run -it --env-file=./.env -v $PWD/auto_gpt_workspace:/app/auto_gpt_workspace autogpt You can pass extra arguments, for instance, running with --gpt3only and --continuous mode: docker run -it --env-file=./.env -v $PWD/auto_gpt_workspace:/app/auto_gpt_workspace autogpt --gpt3only --continuous Command Line Arguments Here are some common arguments you can use when running Auto-GPT: Replace anything in angled brackets (<>) to a value you want to specify python scripts/main.py --help to see a list of all available command line arguments. python scripts/main.py --ai-settings <filename> to run Auto-GPT with a different AI Settings file. python scripts/main.py --use-memory <memory-backend> to specify one of 3 memory backends: local, redis, pinecone or 'no_memory'. NOTE: There are shorthands for some of these flags, for example -m for --use-memory. Use python scripts/main.py --help for more information ??\ufe0f Speech Mode Use this to use TTS for Auto-GPT python -m autogpt --speak ?? Google API Keys Configuration This section is optional, use the official google api if you are having issues with error 429 when running a google search. To use the google_official_search command, you need to set up your Google API keys in your environment variables. Go to the Google Cloud Console. If you don't already have an account, create one and log in. Create a new project by clicking on the \"Select a Project\" dropdown at the top of the page and clicking \"New Project\". Give it a name and click \"Create\". Go to the APIs & Services Dashboard and click \"Enable APIs and Services\". Search for \"Custom Search API\" and click on it, then click \"Enable\". Go to the Credentials page and click \"Create Credentials\". Choose \"API Key\". Copy the API key and set it as an environment variable named GOOGLE_API_KEY on your machine. See setting up environment variables below. Enable the Custom Search API on your project. (Might need to wait few minutes to propagate) Go to the Custom Search Engine page and click \"Add\". Set up your search engine by following the prompts. You can choose to search the entire web or specific sites. Once you've created your search engine, click on \"Control Panel\" and then \"Basics\". Copy the \"Search engine ID\" and set it as an environment variable named CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID on your machine. See setting up environment variables below. Remember that your free daily custom search quota allows only up to 100 searches. To increase this limit, you need to assign a billing account to the project to profit from up to 10K daily searches. Setting up environment variables For Windows Users: setx GOOGLE_API_KEY \"YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY\" setx CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID \"YOUR_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID\" For macOS and Linux users: export GOOGLE_API_KEY=\"YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY\" export CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=\"YOUR_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID\" Redis Setup Install docker desktop. Run: docker run -d --name redis-stack-server -p 6379:6379 redis/redis-stack-server:latest See https://hub.docker.com/r/redis/redis-stack-server for setting a password and additional configuration. Set the following environment variables: MEMORY_BACKEND=redis REDIS_HOST=localhost REDIS_PORT=6379 REDIS_PASSWORD= Note that this is not intended to be run facing the internet and is not secure, do not expose redis to the internet without a password or at all really. You can optionally set WIPE_REDIS_ON_START=False To persist memory stored in Redis. You can specify the memory index for redis using the following: MEMORY_INDEX=whatever ?? Pinecone API Key Setup Pinecone enables the storage of vast amounts of vector-based memory, allowing for only relevant memories to be loaded for the agent at any given time. Go to pinecone and make an account if you don't already have one. Choose the Starter plan to avoid being charged. Find your API key and region under the default project in the left sidebar. Setting up environment variables In the .env file set: PINECONE_API_KEY PINECONE_ENV (something like: us-east4-gcp) MEMORY_BACKEND=pinecone Alternatively, you can set them from the command line (advanced): For Windows Users: setx PINECONE_API_KEY \"YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY\" setx PINECONE_ENV \"Your pinecone region\" # something like: us-east4-gcp setx MEMORY_BACKEND \"pinecone\" For macOS and Linux users: export PINECONE_API_KEY=\"YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY\" export PINECONE_ENV=\"Your pinecone region\" # something like: us-east4-gcp export MEMORY_BACKEND=\"pinecone\" Setting Your Cache Type By default Auto-GPT is going to use LocalCache instead of redis or Pinecone. To switch to either, change the MEMORY_BACKEND env variable to the value that you want: local (default) uses a local JSON cache file pinecone uses the Pinecone.io account you configured in your ENV settings redis will use the redis cache that you configured View Memory Usage View memory usage by using the --debug flag :) ?? Memory pre-seeding # python scripts/data_ingestion.py -h usage: data_ingestion.py [-h] (--file FILE | --dir DIR) [--init] [--overlap OVERLAP] [--max_length MAX_LENGTH] Ingest a file or a directory with multiple files into memory. Make sure to set your .env before running this script. options: -h, --help show this help message and exit --file FILE The file to ingest. --dir DIR The directory containing the files to ingest. --init Init the memory and wipe its content (default: False) --overlap OVERLAP The overlap size between chunks when ingesting files (default: 200) --max_length MAX_LENGTH The max_length of each chunk when ingesting files (default: 4000 # python scripts/data_ingestion.py --dir seed_data --init --overlap 200 --max_length 1000 This script located at scripts/data_ingestion.py, allows you to ingest files into memory and pre-seed it before running Auto-GPT. Memory pre-seeding is a technique that involves ingesting relevant documents or data into the AI's memory so that it can use this information to generate more informed and accurate responses. To pre-seed the memory, the content of each document is split into chunks of a specified maximum length with a specified overlap between chunks, and then each chunk is added to the memory backend set in the .env file. When the AI is prompted to recall information, it can then access those pre-seeded memories to generate more informed and accurate responses. This technique is particularly useful when working with large amounts of data or when there is specific information that the AI needs to be able to access quickly. By pre-seeding the memory, the AI can retrieve and use this information more efficiently, saving time, API call and improving the accuracy of its responses. You could for example download the documentation of an API, a Github repository, etc. and ingest it into memory before running Auto-GPT. \u26a0\ufe0f If you use Redis as your memory, make sure to run Auto-GPT with the WIPE_REDIS_ON_START set to False in your .env file. \u26a0\ufe0fFor other memory backend, we currently forcefully wipe the memory when starting Auto-GPT. To ingest data with those memory backend, you can call the data_ingestion.py script anytime during an Auto-GPT run. Memories will be available to the AI immediately as they are ingested, even if ingested while Auto-GPT is running. In the example above, the script initializes the memory, ingests all files within the seed_data directory into memory with an overlap between chunks of 200 and a maximum length of each chunk of 4000. Note that you can also use the --file argument to ingest a single file into memory and that the script will only ingest files within the auto_gpt_workspace directory. You can adjust the max_length and overlap parameters to fine-tune the way the docuents are presented to the AI when it \"recall\" that memory: Adjusting the overlap value allows the AI to access more contextual information from each chunk when recalling information, but will result in more chunks being created and therefore increase memory backend usage and OpenAI API requests. Reducing the max_length value will create more chunks, which can save prompt tokens by allowing for more message history in the context, but will also increase the number of chunks. Increasing the max_length value will provide the AI with more\n\"\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Auto-GPT es una aplicaci\u00f3n open-source experimental que muestra las capacidades del modelo de lenguaje GPT-4 y que funciona de forma aut\u00f3noma.

questions). \n\nAs a group you will be required to create a PowerPoint presentation which will detail the planning and management issues of a global project. \n\n1.Choose a project you know off or you are interested in provided it is global, whether completed or in progress, and make sure that you are able to gather the information that is necessary for your analysis; \t \n\n2.There are two sets of slides in Blackboard > Learning Material > week 1. These slides give you directions how to use UWE resources to find a case project. \n\n3.Use the tools as described below in section 3. Content below and participate in the workshops to practice each tool with your group. \n\nThe presentation will be live, and all group members will present ONE part of the Assignment for which they will be individually marked. Not all group members will get the same mark necessarily, it depends on the quality of their work and presentation in their own part. Group members who do not participate and contribute to the Assignment will have to re-sit as they will get 0. . \n\nThis assessment strategy is employed to produce the type of output required by professional project management practice that is developed by a typical project team; and to maximize learning opportunities with added values for students\u2019 development and character building.\n\nThis assignment requires you to develop research skills and find information that is useful for the purpose of detecting organizational issues related to the global environment and construct a plan. You will have to work with University databases and search through a large volume of information from Professional associations. \n\nIf you have difficulty to choose a global project here are some choices: \n\nSMART CITIES\nEXAMPLES \nhttps://www.apm.org.uk/blog/five-of-the-uk-s-most-exciting-smart-city-projects/ \nhttps://publications.iadb.org/en/international-case-studies-smart-cities-santander-spain \n\nGLOBAL HEALTHCARE PROJECTS \nEXAMPLES \nhttps://www.bond.org.uk/news/2017/04/7-projects-improving-healthcare-around-the-world \n\nGLOBAL MEDICAL AND BIOTECH RESEARCH PROJECTS \nEXAMPLES \nhttps://globalprojects.ucsf.edu/ \nhttps://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/funding-programmes/global-health.htm\nhttps://www.tendersinfo.com/healthcare-and-medical-pharma-projects.php \nhttps://www.pharmaceuticalonline.com/doc/top-10-international-pharmaceutical-biotech-c-0001 \n\nGLOBAL HUMANITARIAN PROJECTS \nEXAMPLES\nhttps://borgenproject.org/5-top-humanitarian-aid-organizations/ \nhttps://www.humanitarianprojectsinc.com/\n\nThese are some examples, you can find global projects in most industries. \n\nPlease do not just use Apple, Google or Toyota or any of these famous large organizations because you cannot have access to information about their projects. Choose projects about which you can discover information. \n\nI strongly suggest that you attend the workshops and be proactive in forming groups in week 1 and use the Direction files in the Learning Materials folders showing you case study books to select project case studies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.Presentation Content & Structure \nThe live team presentations should not exceed 30 minutes including Q&A and feedback from the tutor. This means that the presentation should be approximately 25 minutes maximum.

However, ten per cent of local projects over-run \ntheir budgets, with a total overspend of eight percent.\nSome flagship projects have over-run their budgets and \ncompletion dates, causing public embarrassment.\nIt is crucial to get these cost and schedule estimates under \ncontrol in order that the booming infrastructure environ\u0002ment in Hong Kong can flourish to its potential while \ncarefully monitoring costs and performance.\nWe investigated whether Artificial Intelligence (AI) can play \na part in accurately predicting these outcomes and identify\u0002ing ahead of time when a project is going off track, allowing \nearly intervention.\nThe large volume of projects in Hong Kong needs to be mon\u0002itored collectively, with a system that allows leaders to focus \ntheir efforts on the projects most likely to fail. An automated \nsystem simplifies this process, and in our studies was found \nto be as accurate as the best-in-class human cost estimates.\nHigh quality data is available in Hong Kong, and we stud\u0002ied a total of 2,700 years of combined construction activity \nand HKD 450bn in construction spent to trial this innova\u0002tive project management approach. We unexpectedly discov\u0002ered, however, that the AI needs only a very small amount \nof data in order to make good predictions.\nWE BELIEVE THESE EARLY FINDINGS WILL \nINFORM A NEW APPROACH TO PROJECT PERFOR\u0002MANCE MONITORING AND LEAD THE WAY IN \nCAPITAL WORKS PROJECTS INTERNATIONALLY\n\n\n\nTHE CHALLENGE\nHong Kong expects project spending to increase by 42% between \n2021 and 2031. The expected annual expenditure will reach up to \nHKD 325bn by 2031. \nHowever, these projects are not without their problems. \nTo spot challenges early, the Project Strategy and Governance \nOffice established a system to support supervision and govern\u0002ance of projects by providing early-warning signals to senior \nleaders of projects that are at risk.\nProjects are used to deliver the \nmost significant initiatives in the world; \nfrom the Olympics, the artificial island \nof Lantau, to the International Space \nStation. \nOne of the challenges currently \nfaced by project leaders and investors is \nthat projects do not perform well. \nThey underperform in terms \nof execution, with significant cost and \nschedule overruns. 50% delays are com\u0002mon. \nOur research has shown this \nwoeful underperformance is so con\u0002sistent that we\u2019ve coined the iron law \nof megaprojects: they are \u2018over budget, \nover time, over and over again\u2019. \nThis poor performance is not a \nrecent phenomenon: it has been fairly \nconsistent for over 70 years. It is also \ncommon to different countries, sectors \nand delivery in the private and public \nsectors. \nThe scale of projects has been \nincreasing for decades. The largest \nmegaprojects have budgets that match \nthe gross domestic products of the larg\u0002est countries. \nThe GDP of Hong Kong \nin 2020 was USD 347bn, a similar \namount to the budget for China\u2019s high \nspeed rail of USD 300bn and the USA\u2019s \njoint strike fighter (USD 400bn). This \nlarge scale means that it is crucial for \nthe money spent on projects to be better \nmanaged. \nThe impacts of funds of this \nsize being mismanaged can be felt on \na national and even international scale. \nOver the period 2008 to 2017, performance on Government projects \nunder the Capital Works Programme \nhas generally been to a good standard, particularly from a budget perspective. Although certain projects \nrequired additional funding owing \nto project specific circumstances, the \nmajority of approved projects were \ndelivered at or under the original \nApproved Project Estimates (APE). \nAdditional funding was required in approximately 10% of the \nprojects and the amount represented \nsome 8% of the total provision of \nthese projects.\nAlso of importance, this period of time was particularly active \nfor the Industry, with approximately \n850 Category A projects having their \nfinal accounts settled. In terms of \ncost, the original APE of these projects totalled approximately HKD \n240bn as compared with cumulative final accounts of approximately \nHKD 210bn \u2013 leading to an overall \nsurplus of HKD 30bn. \nEffectively, this means the \nsurplus generated at the portfolio \nlevel was more than able to offset \nthe cost overruns incurred by a select \nnumber of projects.\nTo reinforce the positive nature of this performance, Professor \nBent Flyvbjerg of the University of \nOxford pointed out that Hong Kong \nis better than many other regions \nwhen it comes to project cost estimation, based on his findings in a study \ncovering over 100 international jurisdictions.\nMegaprojects are those that \ncome with high levels of procurement, design and/or construction \ncomplexity as well as scale. They \ntypically take multiple years to implement and often involve high levels \nof risk to the participants involved.\nUnfortunately, a number of complex \nmegaprojects in Hong Kong have \nsuffered from underperformance in \nthe form of delays, cost overruns \nand/or quality failures in recent \nyears. These incidents have been \nwell documented through extensive \nmedia coverage \u2013 leading to reduced \nlevels of public confidence in the in\u0002dustry.\nThe early stages of a project \nare crucial and can set the tone and \ninfluence its efficacy. One of the \nchallenges of project performance \nis the sensitivity to timescales in taking corrective action. The later such \nactions are undertaken, the harder \nand more resource intensive it is to \nrectify problems. \nHowever, it is not always \neasy to identify risky projects before \nthings have gone wrong and they re\u0002quire substantial and costly remedy.\nThe Construction Industry Council \nestimates that construction expenditure will increase in real terms by up \nto 42% to HKD 325bn, compared \nto 2021. The Development Bureau \nof the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has launched their \nvision for Construction 2.0 to support effective delivery. \nA key policy objective of the \nDevelopment Bureau is \u2018to ensure \nthe effective planning, management \nand implementation of public sector infrastructure development and \nworks programmes in a safe, timely \nand cost-effective manner and to \nmaintain high quality and standards.\u2019\nIn order to do this, it is vital \nfor senior managers to notice problems and ensure efficient, effective \nand timely intervention when necessary. However, senior managers lack \nthe daily and deep involvement in \ntheir projects. They need the right \nmonitoring tools and early-warning \n-sign systems to help them in their \nproject supervision.\n\n\nTHE EXISTING SYSTEM\nEARLY WARNINGS\nA WEB-BASED MONITORING SYSTEM BASED \nON CASHFLOWS OF HISTORIC PROJECTS\nThe Development Bureau \nuses the PSS, or Project Supervision \nSystem, to monitor capital works \nprojects and provide early-warning \nsignals to senior management. The \nPSS is a web-based application comprising a series of standardized project cashflow graphs. \nThe graphs are based on the \npast cashflows of capital works projects. The PSS covers different categories for building and non-building \nprojects with various construction \ndurations.\nAll active projects submit \ntheir actual cashflows to date and \ntheir planned cashflows for the remainder of the project. The PSS uses \nthis information to identify any unusual patterns. \nThere are 3 types of patterns \nwhich then trigger different followup actions.\nFirst, normal performance. \nThe project cashflow falls within the \ngreen zone. There is no follow-up \naction for projects with normal performance. The data of these projects \nwill be stored for future use and refinement of the system.\nSecond, yellow performance \nraises an alert. The project cashflow \nfalls within the yellow zone, meaning \nheads of departments need to review \nthese projects. The review takes in the \nrisk of cost overrun and programme \ndelay. The heads of departments are \nresponsible for the project assessment \nand, if necessary, for the planning \nand implementation of appropriate \nrecovery measures. \nThird, red performance flags \nthe strongest warning. When the \nproject cashflow falls within the red \nzone, the Permanent Secretary for \nDevelopment (Works) chairs a top \nmanagement meeting, which monitors all projects in this category.\n\nThe monitoring system \nprovides a better understanding of \nvarious elements of a project\u2019s performance. Here are some insightful \nexamples from the first year of using \nthe system.\nThe first project falls into the \nlower yellow zone, which indicates \nslow progress. The question to investigate is whether the project might \nbe able to take actions to catch up \n(purple dotted line), or will be delayed (blue dotted line).\nThe second project falls \ninto the upper yellow zone, which \nindicates fast progress or cost overrun. The team needs to investigate \nwhether the project is indeed making very good progress and will be \ncompleted early (purple dotted line), \nor if the project will experience cost \noverrun (blue dotted line). In either \ncase project plans and budgets might \nneed to be adjusted as a result of the \ninvestigation.\nThe third project falls into \nthe lower red zone and has stayed \npersistently in this zone for more \nthan a year. \nThis can signal a very long \ndelay or an overinflated budget due \nto excessive contingency. In this case, \nthe team investigated the project indepth and found that the project carried too much contingency.\nThe project team reviewed \nthe cost and developed a more realistic project budget. Once the cashflow \nwas adjusted according to the new \nbudget, the cashflow fell back into \nthe normal zone.\n\n\n\nAfter using our monitoring system for over a year, we discovered \nthat instead of it being a mere monitoring tool, the system \nprovides a benchmark and even means to set better target for the \nproject teams\u2019 delivery of their projects. The data of these \nprojects, once completed, will form part of the database \ncreating a self-learning and self-updating system. Hong Kong\u2019s \nproject governance will be enhanced by the positive and \ninteractive feedback between the PSS and the ongoing projects.\n\n\n\nTHE DATA\nThese closed projects have a total outturn cost of HKD 460bn (in \n2019 HKD terms) and individual projects range from HKD 10m to 13bn. \nThe mean project value is HKD 550m. \nThe project durations range from 10 months to 18 years, with an \naverage 3-year duration. In total, the portfolio contains more than 2,700 \nyears of construction activity.\nThe average project costs 15% less than forecast, and the range of \ncost outcomes is from 69% below the budget to 59% over budget. There\u2019s \na far greater range in project duration, ranging from 41% shorter than \nplanned to 317% longer than planned. The average delay is 34% for the \ndelayed projects. \nThe historic 2008-17 dataset is representative of current perfor\u0002mance, according to the Development Bureau\u2019s response to the Legislative \nCouncil for projects in 2018-19.\n\n\n\nFIRST FINDING OF THE AI\nPROJECT TYPES\nAI ALGORITHM IDENTIFIED THE GROUPINGS OF PROJECTS THAT \nHAVE A DISTINCTIVE CASHFLOW PATTERN\nTo analyse the cashflow data, \ntwo methods were selected: tracking \nannual performance as a percentage \nof the (1) outturn performance and \n(2) the original plan. \nA relative timeline was de\u0002termined for each project, with the \npercentage of the total duration as\u0002signed to each year. For instance, in a \nfour-year project the first year would \nhave 25% progress, the second 50% \netc. \nThe data for the analysis \ncomprised completed projects con\u0002taining actual outcomes, but the \nforecasted outcomes will be used \nin the future, so the dual reporting \nwill reflect cost and schedule perfor\u0002mance as a percentage of the most \nrecent forecast and the original plan.\nThe analysis used random \nforrests, an artificial intelligence \nmethod to analyse the data. This un\u0002supervised learning algorithm con\u0002sidered all possible characteristics to \ngroup the projects then extracted the \ntypical cashflows from the s-curves \nand compared the fit of the curves. \nAnalysis of the PSS identi\u0002fied that four types of projects had \nstatistically significantly different \noutcomes. The analysis resulted in \na decision tree, where the first deci\u0002sion divides all projects along the \nlines of building or non-building \nprojects. Then the building projects \nare categorised by whether the origi\u0002nal budget was smaller than HKD \n150m or not and the non-building \nprojects were categorised by whether \nthe planned duration was less than \nsix years or not.\n\n\nRESULTS FROM THE AI\nW A R N I N G \nFLAGS\nEach project was assigned a \nwarning flag status; red, amber or \ngreen based on the outcome of the \nproject. If the project finished in the \nmiddle 40% of the historic projects \n(30th\u201370th percentile) the project \ngot a green flag. The bottom and \ntop 5% of the project got a red flag \n(<5th or >95th percentile). All other \nprojects got an amber warning flag \n(5th\u201330th and 70th\u201395th percen\u0002tile).\nAfter assigning the warning \nflag based on the project outcomes \nwe trained three AI algorithms \n(gradient booster, neural network, rolling discretizer) to find out the \nwarning flag status based on progress \nand cashflows.\nThe first AI assigns a warning flag for cost performance. The \nalgorithm looks at progress and then \nthe share of dispensed cash to date \nThe second AI assigns a \nwarning flag for schedule perfor\u0002mance. The algorithm looks at the \nshare of dispensed cash and then at \nthe progress made\nThe rolling discretizer, an algorithm specifically created for this task, achieved the most accurate \npredictions in unseen test data. To \nvalidate the predictive power of the \nalgorithm the data were split into a \ntraining and a test set. The AI learned \nfrom 70% of the data how to assign \nwarning flags. Then the accuracy \nof the warning flags was measured \non the remaining 30% of the data, \nwhich the algorithm had not seen \nbefore.\nThe AI achieves an excellent \nperformance, especially in identify\u0002ing the red projects correctly. The \nperformance is well balanced across \nthe different flags.\n53%\u201369% of all the flags \nassigned to the observations are ac\u0002curate. This means, for example, that \nif the AI assigns a red flag for a cost \noverrun the algorithm is accurate \nnearly 7 out of 10 times. \nThe accuracy of the schedule \nflags is slightly worse. Here the AI is \naccurate in its prediction 18%\u201363% \nof the time.\nThe AI outperforms the split \nby project type, which was only ac\u0002curate in 8%\u201340% of predictions.\nThe AI vastly outperforms \nrandomness. If we simply made an \nuninformed \u201clucky\u201d guess about the \nproject\u2019s risk we would get it right in \n3%\u201325% of times.\nEspecially for the very high \nrisk category \u201cred\u201d the AI is more \nthan 20\u2013times better than a lucky \nguess.\nIn addition to the valida\u0002tion with a test and training set of \nthe data, we tested how little data \nthe AI needs to achieve this level of \naccuracy. The analysis shows that is \npossible with as little as 10% of the \ndata. We were surprised by this find\u0002ing, because we always assumed that \nAI needs lots of data. It turns out we \nwere wrong. Any organisation wish\u0002ing to integrate AI into their early \n-warning-sign system needs some but \nnot vast amounts of data.\nThe AI is far from perfect; \nthe accuracy is surpsingly good even \nthough the algorithm only knew the \ncashflow and type of a project. \nAdding more data in the fu\u0002ture will certainly improve the ac\u0002curacy\n\n\n\nL O O K I N G F O R W A R D \nWITH THE AI\nP R E D I C T I N G \nCOST\nThe accuracy of the warning flag AI is promising enough to train \nmore algorithms on an even more detailed task: forecast the \noutturn cost of projects. A more complex AI, a deep artificial \nneural network, predicted the final outturn cost with an average \nerror of only \u00b18%. The accuracy is as good as a Class 1 estimate.\nThe next challenge we set for \nthe AI algorithms was to predict the \nfinal outturn cost of projects.\nThe AI only knew the per\u0002centage of progress the project had \nachieved so far, measured against the \nplanned project duration at final in\u0002vestment decision and the cashflow \nspent to date as percentage of the \nbudget, that was approved at the fi\u0002nal investment decision.\nFor this challenge we tested \nmany different AI and non-AI algo\u0002rithms, including linear regressions, \nsupport vector machines, gradient \nboosters, random forrest regressions, \nk-nearest neighbours, multilayer \npercepetrons, simple deep neural \nnetworks and complex deep neural \nnetworks.\nWe measured the error of the \npredicted outturn cost in the train\u0002ing data, which tells us how good \nthe AI is at summarising the data it \nknows. We then gave the AI unseen \ndata to test the prediction. As before, \nthe AI used 70% of the data to train \nand 30% for testing.\nThe best performing algo\u0002rithm was the simple deep neural \nnetwork. The mean squared error \nof the predictions for the test data \nwas 1.6 percentage points. The mean \nabsolute error in the test data was 7.9 \npercentage points.\nThis means that on aver\u0002age the forecasted outturn cost was \nwithin \u00b18% at the portfolio level. \nThe mean squared error, which is \nsimilar to the standard deviation, is \nonly \u00b11.6%, thus 68% of predictions \nare within a range of \u00b11.6%, 95% \nof predictions are within a range \nof \u00b13.2% and 99.7% of predictions \nare within \u00b14.8% of the predicted \ncost. The mean absolute error of the \nprediction is \u00b17.9%, therefore an \nindication of the skew in the data, \nwhere very large overruns and fat \ntails are not uncommon.\nThe AI estimate is in line \nwith what conventional cost esti\u0002mation practice considers to be the \nbest cost estimate achievable. The \nAssociation for the Advancement of \nCost Engineering (AACE) suggests \nthat international best practice for \na best-in-class cost estimate has an \nerror between \u00b13% and \u00b115%; to \nachieve an estimate with this narrow \nerror range, 100% of design needs to \nbe completed and detailed informa\u0002tion of unit cost and prices needs to \nbe available. The estimate of the AI \nfalls within the range expected for a \nClass 1 cost estimate.\n\n\n\n\nCASE STUDIES\nSPOTTING RISK\nALL HONG KONG PROJECTS ARE MONITORED BY THE PSS. \nTHESE ARE TWO REAL-LIFE CASES WHERE THE AI SPOTTED RISKY \nPROJECTS EARLY\nWe selected two capital works projects from the portfolio to run the AI analyses. Project 1 has an approved project \ncost estimate (APE) of HKD 5.2bn with completion within 3.5 years. Project 2 has an approved budget of HKD \n1.3bn with a construction duration of 3.9 years. Project 1 has completed its first year of construction. Project 2 \nhas completed its first two years of construction. \nThe latest cashflow information shows that project 1 has spent 1% of its cash and is nearly 29% complete when \nmeasured against the originally planned duration. Project 2 is 51% complete and has spent 21% of its cash.\nFirst, the AI assigned warning flags. Project 1 has a red flag. Project 1 has been spending the budget slower than \nthe AI anticipates based on the typical spending pattern of capital works projects in Hong Kong. The project\u2019s own \nforecast of spend (dotted line) shows \nthat this trend will reverse in the next \ntwo years and exceed usual patterns \nin years 4 and 5. The AI\u2019s flag raises \nquestions about this unusual profile \nof acceleration and suggests further \ninvestigation.\nProject 2 receives a yellow flag. The \nproject is spending its budget more \nslowly than typical projects but it \nforecasts that it will soon be in line \nwith others. The schedule flags show a similar pattern. Project 1 gets a red \nflag for being very late if it can keep \nup the expenditure as is (under the \nassumption that this is not indicating \na big cost underrun). \nProject 2 is progressing like a typical \nproject in Hong Kong and the AI as\u0002signed a green schedule flag. But the \nAI raises questions about the plans \nafter year 5.\nThe AI also produces a cost forecast \nof the final outturn cost. At the mo- ment Project 1 is forecasted to cost \nHKD 4.0bn. For this estimate, the \nAI assumes that the project will not \nfollow its own forecasted trajectory \nbut behave more like a typical project \nin the future. However, the unusual \npattern of expenditure means that if \nthe project does indeed accelerate its \nspend the cost are likely HKD 5.1bn \nclose to the APE. Project 2 has similar issues. The AI forecasts outturn \ncost of HKD 1.0bn. The project\u2019s \nown forecasts show a spike in spending near the end; if that holds true \nthe AI forecasts spending of HKD \n1.3bn. Again the readiness for acceleration should be investigated.\n\n\nThe enhancement of the PSS does not stop here. Our future plans \ninclude adding more detailed project data, further developing \nthe AI to enhance the predictive power and extending the PSS to \nrailway projects in collaboration with other international regions. Our innovations will not only support Hong Kong\u2019s ambi\u0002tious vision but also benefit projects worldwide."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Given the provided global project information, here is a more detailed structure for your PowerPoint presentation, broken down into slides:\n\nSlide 1: Title Slide\n- Project title: AI in Action - Hong Kong Development Bureau's PSS\n- Team member names\n- Date\n\nSlide 2: Executive Summary\n- Importance of cost and schedule estimation for Hong Kong construction projects\n- Challenges faced by the industry\n- Objective of implementing AI to predict project outcomes and provide early-warning signals\n- Overview of findings and potential impact\n\nSlide 3: Project Background\n- Current situation and challenges in Hong Kong construction sector\n- Upcoming increase in project spending\n- Notable past project overruns\n\nSlide 4: Existing System (PSS)\n- Overview of the Project Supervision System\n- Purpose of PSS and how it is utilized for monitoring and providing early-warning signals\n- Explanation of the three types of performance (normal, yellow, and red)\n\nSlide 5: Using AI for Early-Warning Signals"}]}, {"facetValue": "create a PowerPoint presentation analyzing a global project involving the use of AI in project management at the Hong Kong Development Bureau, focusing on the Project Supervision System (PSS) and incorporating cultural dimensions and brainstorming techniques.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "receive guidance and support in creating a PowerPoint presentation for a group project on a global project involving the use of AI in managing public works projects in Hong Kong."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "create a PowerPoint presentation analyzing a global project involving the use of AI in project management at the Hong Kong Development Bureau, focusing on the Project Supervision System (PSS) and incorporating cultural dimensions and brainstorming techniques."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "As a Masters degree student, YOu Have a project and the brief goes thus:\n\n\nComponent A is a team presentation of 25 minutes (with 5 minutes of questions).\n\nAs a group you will be required to create a PowerPoint presentation which will detail the planning and management issues of a global project.\n\n1.Choose a project you know off or you are interested in provided it is global, whether completed or in progress, and make sure that you are able to gather the information that is necessary for your analysis;\n\n2.There are two sets of slides in Blackboard > Learning Material > week 1.

However, ten per cent of local projects over-run\ntheir budgets, with a total overspend of eight percent.\nSome flagship projects have over-run their budgets and\ncompletion dates, causing public embarrassment.\nIt is crucial to get these cost and schedule estimates under\ncontrol in order that the booming infrastructure environ\u0002ment in Hong Kong can flourish to its potential while\ncarefully monitoring costs and performance.\nWe investigated whether Artificial Intelligence (AI) can play\na part in accurately predicting these outcomes and identify\u0002ing ahead of time when a project is going off track, allowing\nearly intervention.\nThe large volume of projects in Hong Kong needs to be mon\u0002itored collectively, with a system that allows leaders to focus\ntheir efforts on the projects most likely to fail. An automated\nsystem simplifies this process, and in our studies was found\nto be as accurate as the best-in-class human cost estimates.\nHigh quality data is available in Hong Kong, and we stud\u0002ied a total of 2,700 years of combined construction activity\nand HKD 450bn in construction spent to trial this innova\u0002tive project management approach. We unexpectedly discov\u0002ered, however, that the AI needs only a very small amount\nof data in order to make good predictions.\nWE BELIEVE THESE EARLY FINDINGS WILL\nINFORM A NEW APPROACH TO PROJECT PERFOR\u0002MANCE MONITORING AND LEAD THE WAY IN\nCAPITAL WORKS PROJECTS INTERNATIONALLY\n\n\n\nTHE CHALLENGE\nHong Kong expects project spending to increase by 42% between\n2021 and 2031. The expected annual expenditure will reach up to\nHKD 325bn by 2031.\nHowever, these projects are not without their problems.\nTo spot challenges early, the Project Strategy and Governance\nOffice established a system to support supervision and govern\u0002ance of projects by providing early-warning signals to senior\nleaders of projects that are at risk.\nProjects are used to deliver the\nmost significant initiatives in the world;\nfrom the Olympics, the artificial island\nof Lantau, to the International Space\nStation.\nOne of the challenges currently\nfaced by project leaders and investors is\nthat projects do not perform well.\nThey underperform in terms\nof execution, with significant cost and\nschedule overruns. 50% delays are com\u0002mon.\nOur research has shown this\nwoeful underperformance is so con\u0002sistent that we\u2019ve coined the iron law\nof megaprojects: they are \u2018over budget,\nover time, over and over again\u2019.\nThis poor performance is not a\nrecent phenomenon: it has been fairly\nconsistent for over 70 years. It is also\ncommon to different countries, sectors\nand delivery in the private and public\nsectors.\nThe scale of projects has been\nincreasing for decades. The largest\nmegaprojects have budgets that match\nthe gross domestic products of the larg\u0002est countries.\nThe GDP of Hong Kong\nin 2020 was USD 347bn, a similar\namount to the budget for China\u2019s high\nspeed rail of USD 300bn and the USA\u2019s\njoint strike fighter (USD 400bn). This\nlarge scale means that it is crucial for\nthe money spent on projects to be better\nmanaged.\nThe impacts of funds of this\nsize being mismanaged can be felt on\na national and even international scale.\nOver the period 2008 to 2017, performance on Government projects\nunder the Capital Works Programme\nhas generally been to a good standard, particularly from a budget perspective. Although certain projects\nrequired additional funding owing\nto project specific circumstances, the\nmajority of approved projects were\ndelivered at or under the original\nApproved Project Estimates (APE).\nAdditional funding was required in approximately 10% of the\nprojects and the amount represented\nsome 8% of the total provision of\nthese projects.\nAlso of importance, this period of time was particularly active\nfor the Industry, with approximately\n850 Category A projects having their\nfinal accounts settled. In terms of\ncost, the original APE of these projects totalled approximately HKD\n240bn as compared with cumulative final accounts of approximately\nHKD 210bn \u2013 leading to an overall\nsurplus of HKD 30bn.\nEffectively, this means the\nsurplus generated at the portfolio\nlevel was more than able to offset\nthe cost overruns incurred by a select\nnumber of projects.\nTo reinforce the positive nature of this performance, Professor\nBent Flyvbjerg of the University of\nOxford pointed out that Hong Kong\nis better than many other regions\nwhen it comes to project cost estimation, based on his findings in a study\ncovering over 100 international jurisdictions.\nMegaprojects are those that\ncome with high levels of procurement, design and/or construction\ncomplexity as well as scale. They\ntypically take multiple years to implement and often involve high levels\nof risk to the participants involved.\nUnfortunately, a number of complex\nmegaprojects in Hong Kong have\nsuffered from underperformance in\nthe form of delays, cost overruns\nand/or quality failures in recent\nyears. These incidents have been\nwell documented through extensive\nmedia coverage \u2013 leading to reduced\nlevels of public confidence in the in\u0002dustry.\nThe early stages of a project\nare crucial and can set the tone and\ninfluence its efficacy. One of the\nchallenges of project performance\nis the sensitivity to timescales in taking corrective action. The later such\nactions are undertaken, the harder\nand more resource intensive it is to\nrectify problems.\nHowever, it is not always\neasy to identify risky projects before\nthings have gone wrong and they re\u0002quire substantial and costly remedy.\nThe Construction Industry Council\nestimates that construction expenditure will increase in real terms by up\nto 42% to HKD 325bn, compared\nto 2021. The Development Bureau\nof the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has launched their\nvision for Construction 2.0 to support effective delivery.\nA key policy objective of the\nDevelopment Bureau is \u2018to ensure\nthe effective planning, management\nand implementation of public sector infrastructure development and\nworks programmes in a safe, timely\nand cost-effective manner and to\nmaintain high quality and standards.\u2019\nIn order to do this, it is vital\nfor senior managers to notice problems and ensure efficient, effective\nand timely intervention when necessary. However, senior managers lack\nthe daily and deep involvement in\ntheir projects. They need the right\nmonitoring tools and early-warning\n-sign systems to help them in their\nproject supervision.\n\n\nTHE EXISTING SYSTEM\nEARLY WARNINGS\nA WEB-BASED MONITORING SYSTEM BASED\nON CASHFLOWS OF HISTORIC PROJECTS\nThe Development Bureau\nuses the PSS, or Project Supervision\nSystem, to monitor capital works\nprojects and provide early-warning\nsignals to senior management. The\nPSS is a web-based application comprising a series of standardized project cashflow graphs.\nThe graphs are based on the\npast cashflows of capital works projects. The PSS covers different categories for building and non-building\nprojects with various construction\ndurations.\nAll active projects submit\ntheir actual cashflows to date and\ntheir planned cashflows for the remainder of the project. The PSS uses\nthis information to identify any unusual patterns.\nThere are 3 types of patterns\nwhich then trigger different followup actions.\nFirst, normal performance.\nThe project cashflow falls within the\ngreen zone. There is no follow-up\naction for projects with normal performance. The data of these projects\nwill be stored for future use and refinement of the system.\nSecond, yellow performance\nraises an alert. The project cashflow\nfalls within the yellow zone, meaning\nheads of departments need to review\nthese projects. The review takes in the\nrisk of cost overrun and programme\ndelay. The heads of departments are\nresponsible for the project assessment\nand, if necessary, for the planning\nand implementation of appropriate\nrecovery measures.\nThird, red performance flags\nthe strongest warning. When the\nproject cashflow falls within the red\nzone, the Permanent Secretary for\nDevelopment (Works) chairs a top\nmanagement meeting, which monitors all projects in this category.\n\nThe monitoring system\nprovides a better understanding of\nvarious elements of a project\u2019s performance. Here are some insightful\nexamples from the first year of using\nthe system.\nThe first project falls into the\nlower yellow zone, which indicates\nslow progress. The question to investigate is whether the project might\nbe able to take actions to catch up\n(purple dotted line), or will be delayed (blue dotted line).\nThe second project falls\ninto the upper yellow zone, which\nindicates fast progress or cost overrun. The team needs to investigate\nwhether the project is indeed making very good progress and will be\ncompleted early (purple dotted line),\nor if the project will experience cost\noverrun (blue dotted line). In either\ncase project plans and budgets might\nneed to be adjusted as a result of the\ninvestigation.\nThe third project falls into\nthe lower red zone and has stayed\npersistently in this zone for more\nthan a year.\nThis can signal a very long\ndelay or an overinflated budget due\nto excessive contingency. In this case,\nthe team investigated the project indepth and found that the project carried too much contingency.\nThe project team reviewed\nthe cost and developed a more realistic project budget. Once the cashflow\nwas adjusted according to the new\nbudget, the cashflow fell back into\nthe normal zone.\n\n\n\nAfter using our monitoring system for over a year, we discovered\nthat instead of it being a mere monitoring tool, the system\nprovides a benchmark and even means to set better target for the\nproject teams\u2019 delivery of their projects. The data of these\nprojects, once completed, will form part of the database\ncreating a self-learning and self-updating system. Hong Kong\u2019s\nproject governance will be enhanced by the positive and\ninteractive feedback between the PSS and the ongoing projects.\n\n\n\nTHE DATA\nThese closed projects have a total outturn cost of HKD 460bn (in\n2019 HKD terms) and individual projects range from HKD 10m to 13bn.\nThe mean project value is HKD 550m.\nThe project durations range from 10 months to 18 years, with an\naverage 3-year duration. In total, the portfolio contains more than 2,700\nyears of construction activity.\nThe average project costs 15% less than forecast, and the range of\ncost outcomes is from 69% below the budget to 59% over budget. There\u2019s\na far greater range in project duration, ranging from 41% shorter than\nplanned to 317% longer than planned. The average delay is 34% for the\ndelayed projects.\nThe historic 2008-17 dataset is representative of current perfor\u0002mance, according to the Development Bureau\u2019s response to the Legislative\nCouncil for projects in 2018-19.\n\n\n\nFIRST FINDING OF THE AI\nPROJECT TYPES\nAI ALGORITHM IDENTIFIED THE GROUPINGS OF PROJECTS THAT\nHAVE A DISTINCTIVE CASHFLOW PATTERN\nTo analyse the cashflow data,\ntwo methods were selected: tracking\nannual performance as a percentage\nof the (1) outturn performance and\n(2) the original plan.\nA relative timeline was de\u0002termined for each project, with the\npercentage of the total duration as\u0002signed to each year. For instance, in a\nfour-year project the first year would\nhave 25% progress, the second 50%\netc.\nThe data for the analysis\ncomprised completed projects con\u0002taining actual outcomes, but the\nforecasted outcomes will be used\nin the future, so the dual reporting\nwill reflect cost and schedule perfor\u0002mance as a percentage of the most\nrecent forecast and the original plan.\nThe analysis used random\nforrests, an artificial intelligence\nmethod to analyse the data. This un\u0002supervised learning algorithm con\u0002sidered all possible characteristics to\ngroup the projects then extracted the\ntypical cashflows from the s-curves\nand compared the fit of the curves.\nAnalysis of the PSS identi\u0002fied that four types of projects had\nstatistically significantly different\noutcomes. The analysis resulted in\na decision tree, where the first deci\u0002sion divides all projects along the\nlines of building or non-building\nprojects. Then the building projects\nare categorised by whether the origi\u0002nal budget was smaller than HKD\n150m or not and the non-building\nprojects were categorised by whether\nthe planned duration was less than\nsix years or not.\n\n\nRESULTS FROM THE AI\nW A R N I N G\nFLAGS\nEach project was assigned a\nwarning flag status; red, amber or\ngreen based on the outcome of the\nproject. If the project finished in the\nmiddle 40% of the historic projects\n(30th\u201370th percentile) the project\ngot a green flag. The bottom and\ntop 5% of the project got a red flag\n(<5th or >95th percentile). All other\nprojects got an amber warning flag\n(5th\u201330th and 70th\u201395th percen\u0002tile).\nAfter assigning the warning\nflag based on the project outcomes\nwe trained three AI algorithms\n(gradient booster, neural network, rolling discretizer) to find out the\nwarning flag status based on progress\nand cashflows.\nThe first AI assigns a warning flag for cost performance. The\nalgorithm looks at progress and then\nthe share of dispensed cash to date\nThe second AI assigns a\nwarning flag for schedule perfor\u0002mance. The algorithm looks at the\nshare of dispensed cash and then at\nthe progress made\nThe rolling discretizer, an algorithm specifically created for this task, achieved the most accurate\npredictions in unseen test data. To\nvalidate the predictive power of the\nalgorithm the data were split into a\ntraining and a test set. The AI learned\nfrom 70% of the data how to assign\nwarning flags. Then the accuracy\nof the warning flags was measured\non the remaining 30% of the data,\nwhich the algorithm had not seen\nbefore.\nThe AI achieves an excellent\nperformance, especially in identify\u0002ing the red projects correctly. The\nperformance is well balanced across\nthe different flags.\n53%\u201369% of all the flags\nassigned to the observations are ac\u0002curate. This means, for example, that\nif the AI assigns a red flag for a cost\noverrun the algorithm is accurate\nnearly 7 out of 10 times.\nThe accuracy of the schedule\nflags is slightly worse. Here the AI is\naccurate in its prediction 18%\u201363%\nof the time.\nThe AI outperforms the split\nby project type, which was only ac\u0002curate in 8%\u201340% of predictions.\nThe AI vastly outperforms\nrandomness. If we simply made an\nuninformed \u201clucky\u201d guess about the\nproject\u2019s risk we would get it right in\n3%\u201325% of times.\nEspecially for the very high\nrisk category \u201cred\u201d the AI is more\nthan 20\u2013times better than a lucky\nguess.\nIn addition to the valida\u0002tion with a test and training set of\nthe data, we tested how little data\nthe AI needs to achieve this level of\naccuracy. The analysis shows that is\npossible with as little as 10% of the\ndata. We were surprised by this find\u0002ing, because we always assumed that\nAI needs lots of data. It turns out we\nwere wrong. Any organisation wish\u0002ing to integrate AI into their early\n-warning-sign system needs some but\nnot vast amounts of data.\nThe AI is far from perfect;\nthe accuracy is surpsingly good even\nthough the algorithm only knew the\ncashflow and type of a project.\nAdding more data in the fu\u0002ture will certainly improve the ac\u0002curacy\n\n\n\nL O O K I N G F O R W A R D\nWITH THE AI\nP R E D I C T I N G\nCOST\nThe accuracy of the warning flag AI is promising enough to train\nmore algorithms on an even more detailed task: forecast the\noutturn cost of projects. A more complex AI, a deep artificial\nneural network, predicted the final outturn cost with an average\nerror of only \u00b18%. The accuracy is as good as a Class 1 estimate.\nThe next challenge we set for\nthe AI algorithms was to predict the\nfinal outturn cost of projects.\nThe AI only knew the per\u0002centage of progress the project had\nachieved so far, measured against the\nplanned project duration at final in\u0002vestment decision and the cashflow\nspent to date as percentage of the\nbudget, that was approved at the fi\u0002nal investment decision.\nFor this challenge we tested\nmany different AI and non-AI algo\u0002rithms, including linear regressions,\nsupport vector machines, gradient\nboosters, random forrest regressions,\nk-nearest neighbours, multilayer\npercepetrons, simple deep neural\nnetworks and complex deep neural\nnetworks.\nWe measured the error of the\npredicted outturn cost in the train\u0002ing data, which tells us how good\nthe AI is at summarising the data it\nknows. We then gave the AI unseen\ndata to test the prediction. As before,\nthe AI used 70% of the data to train\nand 30% for testing.\nThe best performing algo\u0002rithm was the simple deep neural\nnetwork. The mean squared error\nof the predictions for the test data\nwas 1.6 percentage points. The mean\nabsolute error in the test data was 7.9\npercentage points.\nThis means that on aver\u0002age the forecasted outturn cost was\nwithin \u00b18% at the portfolio level.\nThe mean squared error, which is\nsimilar to the standard deviation, is\nonly \u00b11.6%, thus 68% of predictions\nare within a range of \u00b11.6%, 95%\nof predictions are within a range\nof \u00b13.2% and 99.7% of predictions\nare within \u00b14.8% of the predicted\ncost. The mean absolute error of the\nprediction is \u00b17.9%, therefore an\nindication of the skew in the data,\nwhere very large overruns and fat\ntails are not uncommon.\nThe AI estimate is in line\nwith what conventional cost esti\u0002mation practice considers to be the\nbest cost estimate achievable. The\nAssociation for the Advancement of\nCost Engineering (AACE) suggests\nthat international best practice for\na best-in-class cost estimate has an\nerror between \u00b13% and \u00b115%; to\nachieve an estimate with this narrow\nerror range, 100% of design needs to\nbe completed and detailed informa\u0002tion of unit cost and prices needs to\nbe available. The estimate of the AI\nfalls within the range expected for a\nClass 1 cost estimate.\n\n\n\n\nCASE STUDIES\nSPOTTING RISK\nALL HONG KONG PROJECTS ARE MONITORED BY THE PSS.\nTHESE ARE TWO REAL-LIFE CASES WHERE THE AI SPOTTED RISKY\nPROJECTS EARLY\nWe selected two capital works projects from the portfolio to run the AI analyses. Project 1 has an approved project\ncost estimate (APE) of HKD 5.2bn with completion within 3.5 years. Project 2 has an approved budget of HKD\n1.3bn with a construction duration of 3.9 years. Project 1 has completed its first year of construction. Project 2\nhas completed its first two years of construction.\nThe latest cashflow information shows that project 1 has spent 1% of its cash and is nearly 29% complete when\nmeasured against the originally planned duration. Project 2 is 51% complete and has spent 21% of its cash.\nFirst, the AI assigned warning flags. Project 1 has a red flag. Project 1 has been spending the budget slower than\nthe AI anticipates based on the typical spending pattern of capital works projects in Hong Kong. The project\u2019s own\nforecast of spend (dotted line) shows\nthat this trend will reverse in the next\ntwo years and exceed usual patterns\nin years 4 and 5. The AI\u2019s flag raises\nquestions about this unusual profile\nof acceleration and suggests further\ninvestigation.\nProject 2 receives a yellow flag. The\nproject is spending its budget more\nslowly than typical projects but it\nforecasts that it will soon be in line\nwith others. The schedule flags show a similar pattern. Project 1 gets a red\nflag for being very late if it can keep\nup the expenditure as is (under the\nassumption that this is not indicating\na big cost underrun).\nProject 2 is progressing like a typical\nproject in Hong Kong and the AI as\u0002signed a green schedule flag. But the\nAI raises questions about the plans\nafter year 5.\nThe AI also produces a cost forecast\nof the final outturn cost. At the mo- ment Project 1 is forecasted to cost\nHKD 4.0bn. For this estimate, the\nAI assumes that the project will not\nfollow its own forecasted trajectory\nbut behave more like a typical project\nin the future. However, the unusual\npattern of expenditure means that if\nthe project does indeed accelerate its\nspend the cost are likely HKD 5.1bn\nclose to the APE. Project 2 has similar issues. The AI forecasts outturn\ncost of HKD 1.0bn. The project\u2019s\nown forecasts show a spike in spending near the end; if that holds true\nthe AI forecasts spending of HKD\n1.3bn. Again the readiness for acceleration should be investigated.\n\n\nThe enhancement of the PSS does not stop here. Our future plans\ninclude adding more detailed project data, further developing\nthe AI to enhance the predictive power and extending the PSS to\nrailway projects in collaboration with other international regions. Our innovations will not only support Hong Kong\u2019s ambi\u0002tious vision but also benefit projects worldwide.\n\n\nThe Structure is below\n\nSlide 1: Title Slide\n- Project Title: \u201cAI in Action: How the Hong Kong Development Bureau Built the PSS \u2014 An Early-Warning Sign System for Public Works Projects\u201d\n\nSlide 2: Introduction\n- Brief project overview\n- Team members and their respective contributions\n\nSlide 3: Brainstorming Techniques\n- Explain the importance of brainstorming in developing creative solutions\n- Describe different brainstorming techniques used in the project\n\nSlide 4: Hofstede\u2019s Cultural Dimensions\n- Introduce Hofstede\u2019s Cultural Dimensions Theory\n- Analyze cultural differences and challenges in the Hong Kong construction industry and project management\n- Explain their impact on the project\n\nSlide 5: Challenges\n- Present the challenges faced by Hong Kong\u2019s construction industry\n- Discuss the increasing project costs and risks in megaprojects\n\nSlide 6: Existing System (PSS)\n- Describe the Project Supervision System (PSS) and its role in monitoring capital works projects\n- Explain how it raises different levels of warning flags and follow-up actions\n\nSlide 7: AI in PSS\n- Introduce the idea of incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the PSS\n- Describe the benefits of using AI for early-warning signs and project monitoring\n\nSlide 8: AI Algorithm and Data Analysis\n- Outline the AI algorithms used and the data analysis process\n- Explain how AI helps in predicting project outcomes and identifying risky projects\n\nSlide 9: AI Results and Accuracy\n- Present the accuracy of the AI\u2019s predictions for warning flags and outturn costs\n- Explain the performance and potential improvement of the AI\n\nSlide 10: Case Studies\n- Describe two real-life case studies where the AI spotted risky projects early\n- Explain the AI\u2019s role in predicting the outcomes and raising warning flags for these projects\n\nSlide 11: Future Enhancements\n- Discuss plans for adding more detailed project data and improving the AI\u2019s predictive power\n- Explain the potential benefits of extending the PSS to railway projects and other international regions\n\nSlide 12: Conclusion\n- Summarize the value of incorporating AI in the PSS\n- Emphasize the potential benefits to the Hong Kong construction industry and the global project management field\n\nSlide 13: Questions and Answers\n- Open for questions from the audience and provide answers\nAs comprehensively as possible, give me the details of everything in slide 2\n\n\n\nNow, as detailed as possible, give me all the info needed for slide 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Slide 6: Existing System (PSS)\n\n- Introduce the Project Supervision System (PSS): PSS is a web-based application used by Hong Kong's Development Bureau to monitor capital works projects and provide early-warning signals to senior management. The system comprises a series of standardized project cash flow graphs, which are based on the past cash flows of capital works projects.\n\n- Explain the categorization of projects in PSS: Projects are grouped into different categories, such as building and non-building projects, with various construction durations. All active projects must submit their actual cash flows to date and their planned cash flows for the remainder of the project. Using this information, the PSS identifies any unusual patterns in cash flows.\n\n- Describe the warning flag system in PSS: The PSS assigns different warning flags (green, yellow, or red) to projects based on their cash flow patterns.\n\n  - Green Flag (Normal Performance): The project cash flow falls within the green zone, indicating that it's progressing as expected. No follow-up action is needed for projects with normal performance.\n\n  - Yellow Flag (Alert): The project cash flow falls within the yellow zone, signaling potential issues that require closer review by heads of departments. These projects may be at risk of cost overruns or schedule delays. Department heads are responsible for assessing the projects and, if necessary, planning and implementing appropriate recovery measures.\n\n  - Red Flag (Strong Warning): The project cash flow falls within the red zone, indicating significant problems that require a top management meeting chaired by the Permanent Secretary for Development (Works) to monitor and address the issues.\n  \n- Explain the benefits of PSS: Through its early-warning system, the PSS helps senior managers spot potential problems in capital works projects and ensure efficient, effective, and timely interventions when necessary. The PSS also contributes to enhanced project governance and supports continuous improvement of project performance in Hong Kong's construction industry."}]}, {"facetValue": "create a PowerPoint presentation analyzing a global project involving the use of AI in project management at a construction bureau in Hong Kong, focusing on challenges, existing systems, and AI's role in early warning and outcome prediction.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "receive guidance and information on creating a PowerPoint presentation for a group project on a global AI project in Hong Kong, specifically focusing on using brainstorming techniques and analyzing cultural dimensions."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "create a PowerPoint presentation analyzing a global project involving the use of AI in project management at a construction bureau in Hong Kong, focusing on challenges, existing systems, and AI's role in early warning and outcome prediction."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "As a Masters degree student, YOu Have a project and the brief goes thus:\n\n\nComponent A is a team presentation of 25 minutes (with 5 minutes of questions).\n\nAs a group you will be required to create a PowerPoint presentation which will detail the planning and management issues of a global project.\n\n1.Choose a project you know off or you are interested in provided it is global, whether completed or in progress, and make sure that you are able to gather the information that is necessary for your analysis;\n\n2.There are two sets of slides in Blackboard > Learning Material > week 1.

However, ten per cent of local projects over-run\ntheir budgets, with a total overspend of eight percent.\nSome flagship projects have over-run their budgets and\ncompletion dates, causing public embarrassment.\nIt is crucial to get these cost and schedule estimates under\ncontrol in order that the booming infrastructure environ\u0002ment in Hong Kong can flourish to its potential while\ncarefully monitoring costs and performance.\nWe investigated whether Artificial Intelligence (AI) can play\na part in accurately predicting these outcomes and identify\u0002ing ahead of time when a project is going off track, allowing\nearly intervention.\nThe large volume of projects in Hong Kong needs to be mon\u0002itored collectively, with a system that allows leaders to focus\ntheir efforts on the projects most likely to fail. An automated\nsystem simplifies this process, and in our studies was found\nto be as accurate as the best-in-class human cost estimates.\nHigh quality data is available in Hong Kong, and we stud\u0002ied a total of 2,700 years of combined construction activity\nand HKD 450bn in construction spent to trial this innova\u0002tive project management approach. We unexpectedly discov\u0002ered, however, that the AI needs only a very small amount\nof data in order to make good predictions.\nWE BELIEVE THESE EARLY FINDINGS WILL\nINFORM A NEW APPROACH TO PROJECT PERFOR\u0002MANCE MONITORING AND LEAD THE WAY IN\nCAPITAL WORKS PROJECTS INTERNATIONALLY\n\n\n\nTHE CHALLENGE\nHong Kong expects project spending to increase by 42% between\n2021 and 2031. The expected annual expenditure will reach up to\nHKD 325bn by 2031.\nHowever, these projects are not without their problems.\nTo spot challenges early, the Project Strategy and Governance\nOffice established a system to support supervision and govern\u0002ance of projects by providing early-warning signals to senior\nleaders of projects that are at risk.\nProjects are used to deliver the\nmost significant initiatives in the world;\nfrom the Olympics, the artificial island\nof Lantau, to the International Space\nStation.\nOne of the challenges currently\nfaced by project leaders and investors is\nthat projects do not perform well.\nThey underperform in terms\nof execution, with significant cost and\nschedule overruns. 50% delays are com\u0002mon.\nOur research has shown this\nwoeful underperformance is so con\u0002sistent that we\u2019ve coined the iron law\nof megaprojects: they are \u2018over budget,\nover time, over and over again\u2019.\nThis poor performance is not a\nrecent phenomenon: it has been fairly\nconsistent for over 70 years. It is also\ncommon to different countries, sectors\nand delivery in the private and public\nsectors.\nThe scale of projects has been\nincreasing for decades. The largest\nmegaprojects have budgets that match\nthe gross domestic products of the larg\u0002est countries.\nThe GDP of Hong Kong\nin 2020 was USD 347bn, a similar\namount to the budget for China\u2019s high\nspeed rail of USD 300bn and the USA\u2019s\njoint strike fighter (USD 400bn). This\nlarge scale means that it is crucial for\nthe money spent on projects to be better\nmanaged.\nThe impacts of funds of this\nsize being mismanaged can be felt on\na national and even international scale.\nOver the period 2008 to 2017, performance on Government projects\nunder the Capital Works Programme\nhas generally been to a good standard, particularly from a budget perspective. Although certain projects\nrequired additional funding owing\nto project specific circumstances, the\nmajority of approved projects were\ndelivered at or under the original\nApproved Project Estimates (APE).\nAdditional funding was required in approximately 10% of the\nprojects and the amount represented\nsome 8% of the total provision of\nthese projects.\nAlso of importance, this period of time was particularly active\nfor the Industry, with approximately\n850 Category A projects having their\nfinal accounts settled. In terms of\ncost, the original APE of these projects totalled approximately HKD\n240bn as compared with cumulative final accounts of approximately\nHKD 210bn \u2013 leading to an overall\nsurplus of HKD 30bn.\nEffectively, this means the\nsurplus generated at the portfolio\nlevel was more than able to offset\nthe cost overruns incurred by a select\nnumber of projects.\nTo reinforce the positive nature of this performance, Professor\nBent Flyvbjerg of the University of\nOxford pointed out that Hong Kong\nis better than many other regions\nwhen it comes to project cost estimation, based on his findings in a study\ncovering over 100 international jurisdictions.\nMegaprojects are those that\ncome with high levels of procurement, design and/or construction\ncomplexity as well as scale. They\ntypically take multiple years to implement and often involve high levels\nof risk to the participants involved.\nUnfortunately, a number of complex\nmegaprojects in Hong Kong have\nsuffered from underperformance in\nthe form of delays, cost overruns\nand/or quality failures in recent\nyears. These incidents have been\nwell documented through extensive\nmedia coverage \u2013 leading to reduced\nlevels of public confidence in the in\u0002dustry.\nThe early stages of a project\nare crucial and can set the tone and\ninfluence its efficacy. One of the\nchallenges of project performance\nis the sensitivity to timescales in taking corrective action. The later such\nactions are undertaken, the harder\nand more resource intensive it is to\nrectify problems.\nHowever, it is not always\neasy to identify risky projects before\nthings have gone wrong and they re\u0002quire substantial and costly remedy.\nThe Construction Industry Council\nestimates that construction expenditure will increase in real terms by up\nto 42% to HKD 325bn, compared\nto 2021. The Development Bureau\nof the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has launched their\nvision for Construction 2.0 to support effective delivery.\nA key policy objective of the\nDevelopment Bureau is \u2018to ensure\nthe effective planning, management\nand implementation of public sector infrastructure development and\nworks programmes in a safe, timely\nand cost-effective manner and to\nmaintain high quality and standards.\u2019\nIn order to do this, it is vital\nfor senior managers to notice problems and ensure efficient, effective\nand timely intervention when necessary. However, senior managers lack\nthe daily and deep involvement in\ntheir projects. They need the right\nmonitoring tools and early-warning\n-sign systems to help them in their\nproject supervision.\n\n\nTHE EXISTING SYSTEM\nEARLY WARNINGS\nA WEB-BASED MONITORING SYSTEM BASED\nON CASHFLOWS OF HISTORIC PROJECTS\nThe Development Bureau\nuses the PSS, or Project Supervision\nSystem, to monitor capital works\nprojects and provide early-warning\nsignals to senior management. The\nPSS is a web-based application comprising a series of standardized project cashflow graphs.\nThe graphs are based on the\npast cashflows of capital works projects. The PSS covers different categories for building and non-building\nprojects with various construction\ndurations.\nAll active projects submit\ntheir actual cashflows to date and\ntheir planned cashflows for the remainder of the project. The PSS uses\nthis information to identify any unusual patterns.\nThere are 3 types of patterns\nwhich then trigger different followup actions.\nFirst, normal performance.\nThe project cashflow falls within the\ngreen zone. There is no follow-up\naction for projects with normal performance. The data of these projects\nwill be stored for future use and refinement of the system.\nSecond, yellow performance\nraises an alert. The project cashflow\nfalls within the yellow zone, meaning\nheads of departments need to review\nthese projects. The review takes in the\nrisk of cost overrun and programme\ndelay. The heads of departments are\nresponsible for the project assessment\nand, if necessary, for the planning\nand implementation of appropriate\nrecovery measures.\nThird, red performance flags\nthe strongest warning. When the\nproject cashflow falls within the red\nzone, the Permanent Secretary for\nDevelopment (Works) chairs a top\nmanagement meeting, which monitors all projects in this category.\n\nThe monitoring system\nprovides a better understanding of\nvarious elements of a project\u2019s performance. Here are some insightful\nexamples from the first year of using\nthe system.\nThe first project falls into the\nlower yellow zone, which indicates\nslow progress. The question to investigate is whether the project might\nbe able to take actions to catch up\n(purple dotted line), or will be delayed (blue dotted line).\nThe second project falls\ninto the upper yellow zone, which\nindicates fast progress or cost overrun. The team needs to investigate\nwhether the project is indeed making very good progress and will be\ncompleted early (purple dotted line),\nor if the project will experience cost\noverrun (blue dotted line). In either\ncase project plans and budgets might\nneed to be adjusted as a result of the\ninvestigation.\nThe third project falls into\nthe lower red zone and has stayed\npersistently in this zone for more\nthan a year.\nThis can signal a very long\ndelay or an overinflated budget due\nto excessive contingency. In this case,\nthe team investigated the project indepth and found that the project carried too much contingency.\nThe project team reviewed\nthe cost and developed a more realistic project budget. Once the cashflow\nwas adjusted according to the new\nbudget, the cashflow fell back into\nthe normal zone.\n\n\n\nAfter using our monitoring system for over a year, we discovered\nthat instead of it being a mere monitoring tool, the system\nprovides a benchmark and even means to set better target for the\nproject teams\u2019 delivery of their projects. The data of these\nprojects, once completed, will form part of the database\ncreating a self-learning and self-updating system. Hong Kong\u2019s\nproject governance will be enhanced by the positive and\ninteractive feedback between the PSS and the ongoing projects.\n\n\n\nTHE DATA\nThese closed projects have a total outturn cost of HKD 460bn (in\n2019 HKD terms) and individual projects range from HKD 10m to 13bn.\nThe mean project value is HKD 550m.\nThe project durations range from 10 months to 18 years, with an\naverage 3-year duration. In total, the portfolio contains more than 2,700\nyears of construction activity.\nThe average project costs 15% less than forecast, and the range of\ncost outcomes is from 69% below the budget to 59% over budget. There\u2019s\na far greater range in project duration, ranging from 41% shorter than\nplanned to 317% longer than planned. The average delay is 34% for the\ndelayed projects.\nThe historic 2008-17 dataset is representative of current perfor\u0002mance, according to the Development Bureau\u2019s response to the Legislative\nCouncil for projects in 2018-19.\n\n\n\nFIRST FINDING OF THE AI\nPROJECT TYPES\nAI ALGORITHM IDENTIFIED THE GROUPINGS OF PROJECTS THAT\nHAVE A DISTINCTIVE CASHFLOW PATTERN\nTo analyse the cashflow data,\ntwo methods were selected: tracking\nannual performance as a percentage\nof the (1) outturn performance and\n(2) the original plan.\nA relative timeline was de\u0002termined for each project, with the\npercentage of the total duration as\u0002signed to each year. For instance, in a\nfour-year project the first year would\nhave 25% progress, the second 50%\netc.\nThe data for the analysis\ncomprised completed projects con\u0002taining actual outcomes, but the\nforecasted outcomes will be used\nin the future, so the dual reporting\nwill reflect cost and schedule perfor\u0002mance as a percentage of the most\nrecent forecast and the original plan.\nThe analysis used random\nforrests, an artificial intelligence\nmethod to analyse the data. This un\u0002supervised learning algorithm con\u0002sidered all possible characteristics to\ngroup the projects then extracted the\ntypical cashflows from the s-curves\nand compared the fit of the curves.\nAnalysis of the PSS identi\u0002fied that four types of projects had\nstatistically significantly different\noutcomes. The analysis resulted in\na decision tree, where the first deci\u0002sion divides all projects along the\nlines of building or non-building\nprojects. Then the building projects\nare categorised by whether the origi\u0002nal budget was smaller than HKD\n150m or not and the non-building\nprojects were categorised by whether\nthe planned duration was less than\nsix years or not.\n\n\nRESULTS FROM THE AI\nW A R N I N G\nFLAGS\nEach project was assigned a\nwarning flag status; red, amber or\ngreen based on the outcome of the\nproject. If the project finished in the\nmiddle 40% of the historic projects\n(30th\u201370th percentile) the project\ngot a green flag. The bottom and\ntop 5% of the project got a red flag\n(<5th or >95th percentile). All other\nprojects got an amber warning flag\n(5th\u201330th and 70th\u201395th percen\u0002tile).\nAfter assigning the warning\nflag based on the project outcomes\nwe trained three AI algorithms\n(gradient booster, neural network, rolling discretizer) to find out the\nwarning flag status based on progress\nand cashflows.\nThe first AI assigns a warning flag for cost performance. The\nalgorithm looks at progress and then\nthe share of dispensed cash to date\nThe second AI assigns a\nwarning flag for schedule perfor\u0002mance. The algorithm looks at the\nshare of dispensed cash and then at\nthe progress made\nThe rolling discretizer, an algorithm specifically created for this task, achieved the most accurate\npredictions in unseen test data. To\nvalidate the predictive power of the\nalgorithm the data were split into a\ntraining and a test set. The AI learned\nfrom 70% of the data how to assign\nwarning flags. Then the accuracy\nof the warning flags was measured\non the remaining 30% of the data,\nwhich the algorithm had not seen\nbefore.\nThe AI achieves an excellent\nperformance, especially in identify\u0002ing the red projects correctly. The\nperformance is well balanced across\nthe different flags.\n53%\u201369% of all the flags\nassigned to the observations are ac\u0002curate. This means, for example, that\nif the AI assigns a red flag for a cost\noverrun the algorithm is accurate\nnearly 7 out of 10 times.\nThe accuracy of the schedule\nflags is slightly worse. Here the AI is\naccurate in its prediction 18%\u201363%\nof the time.\nThe AI outperforms the split\nby project type, which was only ac\u0002curate in 8%\u201340% of predictions.\nThe AI vastly outperforms\nrandomness. If we simply made an\nuninformed \u201clucky\u201d guess about the\nproject\u2019s risk we would get it right in\n3%\u201325% of times.\nEspecially for the very high\nrisk category \u201cred\u201d the AI is more\nthan 20\u2013times better than a lucky\nguess.\nIn addition to the valida\u0002tion with a test and training set of\nthe data, we tested how little data\nthe AI needs to achieve this level of\naccuracy. The analysis shows that is\npossible with as little as 10% of the\ndata. We were surprised by this find\u0002ing, because we always assumed that\nAI needs lots of data. It turns out we\nwere wrong. Any organisation wish\u0002ing to integrate AI into their early\n-warning-sign system needs some but\nnot vast amounts of data.\nThe AI is far from perfect;\nthe accuracy is surpsingly good even\nthough the algorithm only knew the\ncashflow and type of a project.\nAdding more data in the fu\u0002ture will certainly improve the ac\u0002curacy\n\n\n\nL O O K I N G F O R W A R D\nWITH THE AI\nP R E D I C T I N G\nCOST\nThe accuracy of the warning flag AI is promising enough to train\nmore algorithms on an even more detailed task: forecast the\noutturn cost of projects. A more complex AI, a deep artificial\nneural network, predicted the final outturn cost with an average\nerror of only \u00b18%. The accuracy is as good as a Class 1 estimate.\nThe next challenge we set for\nthe AI algorithms was to predict the\nfinal outturn cost of projects.\nThe AI only knew the per\u0002centage of progress the project had\nachieved so far, measured against the\nplanned project duration at final in\u0002vestment decision and the cashflow\nspent to date as percentage of the\nbudget, that was approved at the fi\u0002nal investment decision.\nFor this challenge we tested\nmany different AI and non-AI algo\u0002rithms, including linear regressions,\nsupport vector machines, gradient\nboosters, random forrest regressions,\nk-nearest neighbours, multilayer\npercepetrons, simple deep neural\nnetworks and complex deep neural\nnetworks.\nWe measured the error of the\npredicted outturn cost in the train\u0002ing data, which tells us how good\nthe AI is at summarising the data it\nknows. We then gave the AI unseen\ndata to test the prediction. As before,\nthe AI used 70% of the data to train\nand 30% for testing.\nThe best performing algo\u0002rithm was the simple deep neural\nnetwork. The mean squared error\nof the predictions for the test data\nwas 1.6 percentage points. The mean\nabsolute error in the test data was 7.9\npercentage points.\nThis means that on aver\u0002age the forecasted outturn cost was\nwithin \u00b18% at the portfolio level.\nThe mean squared error, which is\nsimilar to the standard deviation, is\nonly \u00b11.6%, thus 68% of predictions\nare within a range of \u00b11.6%, 95%\nof predictions are within a range\nof \u00b13.2% and 99.7% of predictions\nare within \u00b14.8% of the predicted\ncost. The mean absolute error of the\nprediction is \u00b17.9%, therefore an\nindication of the skew in the data,\nwhere very large overruns and fat\ntails are not uncommon.\nThe AI estimate is in line\nwith what conventional cost esti\u0002mation practice considers to be the\nbest cost estimate achievable. The\nAssociation for the Advancement of\nCost Engineering (AACE) suggests\nthat international best practice for\na best-in-class cost estimate has an\nerror between \u00b13% and \u00b115%; to\nachieve an estimate with this narrow\nerror range, 100% of design needs to\nbe completed and detailed informa\u0002tion of unit cost and prices needs to\nbe available. The estimate of the AI\nfalls within the range expected for a\nClass 1 cost estimate.\n\n\n\n\nCASE STUDIES\nSPOTTING RISK\nALL HONG KONG PROJECTS ARE MONITORED BY THE PSS.\nTHESE ARE TWO REAL-LIFE CASES WHERE THE AI SPOTTED RISKY\nPROJECTS EARLY\nWe selected two capital works projects from the portfolio to run the AI analyses. Project 1 has an approved project\ncost estimate (APE) of HKD 5.2bn with completion within 3.5 years. Project 2 has an approved budget of HKD\n1.3bn with a construction duration of 3.9 years. Project 1 has completed its first year of construction. Project 2\nhas completed its first two years of construction.\nThe latest cashflow information shows that project 1 has spent 1% of its cash and is nearly 29% complete when\nmeasured against the originally planned duration. Project 2 is 51% complete and has spent 21% of its cash.\nFirst, the AI assigned warning flags. Project 1 has a red flag. Project 1 has been spending the budget slower than\nthe AI anticipates based on the typical spending pattern of capital works projects in Hong Kong. The project\u2019s own\nforecast of spend (dotted line) shows\nthat this trend will reverse in the next\ntwo years and exceed usual patterns\nin years 4 and 5. The AI\u2019s flag raises\nquestions about this unusual profile\nof acceleration and suggests further\ninvestigation.\nProject 2 receives a yellow flag. The\nproject is spending its budget more\nslowly than typical projects but it\nforecasts that it will soon be in line\nwith others. The schedule flags show a similar pattern. Project 1 gets a red\nflag for being very late if it can keep\nup the expenditure as is (under the\nassumption that this is not indicating\na big cost underrun).\nProject 2 is progressing like a typical\nproject in Hong Kong and the AI as\u0002signed a green schedule flag. But the\nAI raises questions about the plans\nafter year 5.\nThe AI also produces a cost forecast\nof the final outturn cost. At the mo- ment Project 1 is forecasted to cost\nHKD 4.0bn. For this estimate, the\nAI assumes that the project will not\nfollow its own forecasted trajectory\nbut behave more like a typical project\nin the future. However, the unusual\npattern of expenditure means that if\nthe project does indeed accelerate its\nspend the cost are likely HKD 5.1bn\nclose to the APE. Project 2 has similar issues. The AI forecasts outturn\ncost of HKD 1.0bn. The project\u2019s\nown forecasts show a spike in spending near the end; if that holds true\nthe AI forecasts spending of HKD\n1.3bn. Again the readiness for acceleration should be investigated.\n\n\nThe enhancement of the PSS does not stop here. Our future plans\ninclude adding more detailed project data, further developing\nthe AI to enhance the predictive power and extending the PSS to\nrailway projects in collaboration with other international regions. Our innovations will not only support Hong Kong\u2019s ambi\u0002tious vision but also benefit projects worldwide.\n\n\nThe Structure is below\n\nSlide 1: Title Slide\n- Project Title: \u201cAI in Action: How the Hong Kong Development Bureau Built the PSS \u2014 An Early-Warning Sign System for Public Works Projects\u201d\n\nSlide 2: Introduction\n- Brief project overview\n- Team members and their respective contributions\n\nSlide 3: Brainstorming Techniques\n- Explain the importance of brainstorming in developing creative solutions\n- Describe different brainstorming techniques used in the project\n\nSlide 4: Hofstede\u2019s Cultural Dimensions\n- Introduce Hofstede\u2019s Cultural Dimensions Theory\n- Analyze cultural differences and challenges in the Hong Kong construction industry and project management\n- Explain their impact on the project\n\nSlide 5: Challenges\n- Present the challenges faced by Hong Kong\u2019s construction industry\n- Discuss the increasing project costs and risks in megaprojects\n\nSlide 6: Existing System (PSS)\n- Describe the Project Supervision System (PSS) and its role in monitoring capital works projects\n- Explain how it raises different levels of warning flags and follow-up actions\n\nSlide 7: AI in PSS\n- Introduce the idea of incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the PSS\n- Describe the benefits of using AI for early-warning signs and project monitoring\n\nSlide 8: AI Algorithm and Data Analysis\n- Outline the AI algorithms used and the data analysis process\n- Explain how AI helps in predicting project outcomes and identifying risky projects\n\nSlide 9: AI Results and Accuracy\n- Present the accuracy of the AI\u2019s predictions for warning flags and outturn costs\n- Explain the performance and potential improvement of the AI\n\nSlide 10: Case Studies\n- Describe two real-life case studies where the AI spotted risky projects early\n- Explain the AI\u2019s role in predicting the outcomes and raising warning flags for these projects\n\nSlide 11: Future Enhancements\n- Discuss plans for adding more detailed project data and improving the AI\u2019s predictive power\n- Explain the potential benefits of extending the PSS to railway projects and other international regions\n\nSlide 12: Conclusion\n- Summarize the value of incorporating AI in the PSS\n- Emphasize the potential benefits to the Hong Kong construction industry and the global project management field\n\nSlide 13: Questions and Answers\n- Open for questions from the audience and provide answers\nAs comprehensively as possible, give me the details of everything in slide 2\n\n\n\nNow, as detailed as possible, give me all the info needed for slide 7"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Slide 7: AI in PSS\n\nTitle: Incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into PSS\n\n- Introduce the concept and benefits of AI in Early-warning systems:\n  -

However, ten per cent of local projects over-run\ntheir budgets, with a total overspend of eight percent.\nSome flagship projects have over-run their budgets and\ncompletion dates, causing public embarrassment.\nIt is crucial to get these cost and schedule estimates under\ncontrol in order that the booming infrastructure environ\u0002ment in Hong Kong can flourish to its potential while\ncarefully monitoring costs and performance.\nWe investigated whether Artificial Intelligence (AI) can play\na part in accurately predicting these outcomes and identify\u0002ing ahead of time when a project is going off track, allowing\nearly intervention.\nThe large volume of projects in Hong Kong needs to be mon\u0002itored collectively, with a system that allows leaders to focus\ntheir efforts on the projects most likely to fail. An automated\nsystem simplifies this process, and in our studies was found\nto be as accurate as the best-in-class human cost estimates.\nHigh quality data is available in Hong Kong, and we stud\u0002ied a total of 2,700 years of combined construction activity\nand HKD 450bn in construction spent to trial this innova\u0002tive project management approach. We unexpectedly discov\u0002ered, however, that the AI needs only a very small amount\nof data in order to make good predictions.\nWE BELIEVE THESE EARLY FINDINGS WILL\nINFORM A NEW APPROACH TO PROJECT PERFOR\u0002MANCE MONITORING AND LEAD THE WAY IN\nCAPITAL WORKS PROJECTS INTERNATIONALLY\n\n\n\nTHE CHALLENGE\nHong Kong expects project spending to increase by 42% between\n2021 and 2031. The expected annual expenditure will reach up to\nHKD 325bn by 2031.\nHowever, these projects are not without their problems.\nTo spot challenges early, the Project Strategy and Governance\nOffice established a system to support supervision and govern\u0002ance of projects by providing early-warning signals to senior\nleaders of projects that are at risk.\nProjects are used to deliver the\nmost significant initiatives in the world;\nfrom the Olympics, the artificial island\nof Lantau, to the International Space\nStation.\nOne of the challenges currently\nfaced by project leaders and investors is\nthat projects do not perform well.\nThey underperform in terms\nof execution, with significant cost and\nschedule overruns. 50% delays are com\u0002mon.\nOur research has shown this\nwoeful underperformance is so con\u0002sistent that we\u2019ve coined the iron law\nof megaprojects: they are \u2018over budget,\nover time, over and over again\u2019.\nThis poor performance is not a\nrecent phenomenon: it has been fairly\nconsistent for over 70 years. It is also\ncommon to different countries, sectors\nand delivery in the private and public\nsectors.\nThe scale of projects has been\nincreasing for decades. The largest\nmegaprojects have budgets that match\nthe gross domestic products of the larg\u0002est countries.\nThe GDP of Hong Kong\nin 2020 was USD 347bn, a similar\namount to the budget for China\u2019s high\nspeed rail of USD 300bn and the USA\u2019s\njoint strike fighter (USD 400bn). This\nlarge scale means that it is crucial for\nthe money spent on projects to be better\nmanaged.\nThe impacts of funds of this\nsize being mismanaged can be felt on\na national and even international scale.\nOver the period 2008 to 2017, performance on Government projects\nunder the Capital Works Programme\nhas generally been to a good standard, particularly from a budget perspective. Although certain projects\nrequired additional funding owing\nto project specific circumstances, the\nmajority of approved projects were\ndelivered at or under the original\nApproved Project Estimates (APE).\nAdditional funding was required in approximately 10% of the\nprojects and the amount represented\nsome 8% of the total provision of\nthese projects.\nAlso of importance, this period of time was particularly active\nfor the Industry, with approximately\n850 Category A projects having their\nfinal accounts settled. In terms of\ncost, the original APE of these projects totalled approximately HKD\n240bn as compared with cumulative final accounts of approximately\nHKD 210bn \u2013 leading to an overall\nsurplus of HKD 30bn.\nEffectively, this means the\nsurplus generated at the portfolio\nlevel was more than able to offset\nthe cost overruns incurred by a select\nnumber of projects.\nTo reinforce the positive nature of this performance, Professor\nBent Flyvbjerg of the University of\nOxford pointed out that Hong Kong\nis better than many other regions\nwhen it comes to project cost estimation, based on his findings in a study\ncovering over 100 international jurisdictions.\nMegaprojects are those that\ncome with high levels of procurement, design and/or construction\ncomplexity as well as scale. They\ntypically take multiple years to implement and often involve high levels\nof risk to the participants involved.\nUnfortunately, a number of complex\nmegaprojects in Hong Kong have\nsuffered from underperformance in\nthe form of delays, cost overruns\nand/or quality failures in recent\nyears. These incidents have been\nwell documented through extensive\nmedia coverage \u2013 leading to reduced\nlevels of public confidence in the in\u0002dustry.\nThe early stages of a project\nare crucial and can set the tone and\ninfluence its efficacy. One of the\nchallenges of project performance\nis the sensitivity to timescales in taking corrective action. The later such\nactions are undertaken, the harder\nand more resource intensive it is to\nrectify problems.\nHowever, it is not always\neasy to identify risky projects before\nthings have gone wrong and they re\u0002quire substantial and costly remedy.\nThe Construction Industry Council\nestimates that construction expenditure will increase in real terms by up\nto 42% to HKD 325bn, compared\nto 2021. The Development Bureau\nof the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has launched their\nvision for Construction 2.0 to support effective delivery.\nA key policy objective of the\nDevelopment Bureau is \u2018to ensure\nthe effective planning, management\nand implementation of public sector infrastructure development and\nworks programmes in a safe, timely\nand cost-effective manner and to\nmaintain high quality and standards.\u2019\nIn order to do this, it is vital\nfor senior managers to notice problems and ensure efficient, effective\nand timely intervention when necessary. However, senior managers lack\nthe daily and deep involvement in\ntheir projects. They need the right\nmonitoring tools and early-warning\n-sign systems to help them in their\nproject supervision.\n\n\nTHE EXISTING SYSTEM\nEARLY WARNINGS\nA WEB-BASED MONITORING SYSTEM BASED\nON CASHFLOWS OF HISTORIC PROJECTS\nThe Development Bureau\nuses the PSS, or Project Supervision\nSystem, to monitor capital works\nprojects and provide early-warning\nsignals to senior management. The\nPSS is a web-based application comprising a series of standardized project cashflow graphs.\nThe graphs are based on the\npast cashflows of capital works projects. The PSS covers different categories for building and non-building\nprojects with various construction\ndurations.\nAll active projects submit\ntheir actual cashflows to date and\ntheir planned cashflows for the remainder of the project. The PSS uses\nthis information to identify any unusual patterns.\nThere are 3 types of patterns\nwhich then trigger different followup actions.\nFirst, normal performance.\nThe project cashflow falls within the\ngreen zone. There is no follow-up\naction for projects with normal performance. The data of these projects\nwill be stored for future use and refinement of the system.\nSecond, yellow performance\nraises an alert. The project cashflow\nfalls within the yellow zone, meaning\nheads of departments need to review\nthese projects. The review takes in the\nrisk of cost overrun and programme\ndelay. The heads of departments are\nresponsible for the project assessment\nand, if necessary, for the planning\nand implementation of appropriate\nrecovery measures.\nThird, red performance flags\nthe strongest warning. When the\nproject cashflow falls within the red\nzone, the Permanent Secretary for\nDevelopment (Works) chairs a top\nmanagement meeting, which monitors all projects in this category.\n\nThe monitoring system\nprovides a better understanding of\nvarious elements of a project\u2019s performance. Here are some insightful\nexamples from the first year of using\nthe system.\nThe first project falls into the\nlower yellow zone, which indicates\nslow progress. The question to investigate is whether the project might\nbe able to take actions to catch up\n(purple dotted line), or will be delayed (blue dotted line).\nThe second project falls\ninto the upper yellow zone, which\nindicates fast progress or cost overrun. The team needs to investigate\nwhether the project is indeed making very good progress and will be\ncompleted early (purple dotted line),\nor if the project will experience cost\noverrun (blue dotted line). In either\ncase project plans and budgets might\nneed to be adjusted as a result of the\ninvestigation.\nThe third project falls into\nthe lower red zone and has stayed\npersistently in this zone for more\nthan a year.\nThis can signal a very long\ndelay or an overinflated budget due\nto excessive contingency. In this case,\nthe team investigated the project indepth and found that the project carried too much contingency.\nThe project team reviewed\nthe cost and developed a more realistic project budget. Once the cashflow\nwas adjusted according to the new\nbudget, the cashflow fell back into\nthe normal zone.\n\n\n\nAfter using our monitoring system for over a year, we discovered\nthat instead of it being a mere monitoring tool, the system\nprovides a benchmark and even means to set better target for the\nproject teams\u2019 delivery of their projects. The data of these\nprojects, once completed, will form part of the database\ncreating a self-learning and self-updating system. Hong Kong\u2019s\nproject governance will be enhanced by the positive and\ninteractive feedback between the PSS and the ongoing projects.\n\n\n\nTHE DATA\nThese closed projects have a total outturn cost of HKD 460bn (in\n2019 HKD terms) and individual projects range from HKD 10m to 13bn.\nThe mean project value is HKD 550m.\nThe project durations range from 10 months to 18 years, with an\naverage 3-year duration. In total, the portfolio contains more than 2,700\nyears of construction activity.\nThe average project costs 15% less than forecast, and the range of\ncost outcomes is from 69% below the budget to 59% over budget. There\u2019s\na far greater range in project duration, ranging from 41% shorter than\nplanned to 317% longer than planned. The average delay is 34% for the\ndelayed projects.\nThe historic 2008-17 dataset is representative of current perfor\u0002mance, according to the Development Bureau\u2019s response to the Legislative\nCouncil for projects in 2018-19.\n\n\n\nFIRST FINDING OF THE AI\nPROJECT TYPES\nAI ALGORITHM IDENTIFIED THE GROUPINGS OF PROJECTS THAT\nHAVE A DISTINCTIVE CASHFLOW PATTERN\nTo analyse the cashflow data,\ntwo methods were selected: tracking\nannual performance as a percentage\nof the (1) outturn performance and\n(2) the original plan.\nA relative timeline was de\u0002termined for each project, with the\npercentage of the total duration as\u0002signed to each year. For instance, in a\nfour-year project the first year would\nhave 25% progress, the second 50%\netc.\nThe data for the analysis\ncomprised completed projects con\u0002taining actual outcomes, but the\nforecasted outcomes will be used\nin the future, so the dual reporting\nwill reflect cost and schedule perfor\u0002mance as a percentage of the most\nrecent forecast and the original plan.\nThe analysis used random\nforrests, an artificial intelligence\nmethod to analyse the data. This un\u0002supervised learning algorithm con\u0002sidered all possible characteristics to\ngroup the projects then extracted the\ntypical cashflows from the s-curves\nand compared the fit of the curves.\nAnalysis of the PSS identi\u0002fied that four types of projects had\nstatistically significantly different\noutcomes. The analysis resulted in\na decision tree, where the first deci\u0002sion divides all projects along the\nlines of building or non-building\nprojects. Then the building projects\nare categorised by whether the origi\u0002nal budget was smaller than HKD\n150m or not and the non-building\nprojects were categorised by whether\nthe planned duration was less than\nsix years or not.\n\n\nRESULTS FROM THE AI\nW A R N I N G\nFLAGS\nEach project was assigned a\nwarning flag status; red, amber or\ngreen based on the outcome of the\nproject. If the project finished in the\nmiddle 40% of the historic projects\n(30th\u201370th percentile) the project\ngot a green flag. The bottom and\ntop 5% of the project got a red flag\n(<5th or >95th percentile). All other\nprojects got an amber warning flag\n(5th\u201330th and 70th\u201395th percen\u0002tile).\nAfter assigning the warning\nflag based on the project outcomes\nwe trained three AI algorithms\n(gradient booster, neural network, rolling discretizer) to find out the\nwarning flag status based on progress\nand cashflows.\nThe first AI assigns a warning flag for cost performance. The\nalgorithm looks at progress and then\nthe share of dispensed cash to date\nThe second AI assigns a\nwarning flag for schedule perfor\u0002mance. The algorithm looks at the\nshare of dispensed cash and then at\nthe progress made\nThe rolling discretizer, an algorithm specifically created for this task, achieved the most accurate\npredictions in unseen test data. To\nvalidate the predictive power of the\nalgorithm the data were split into a\ntraining and a test set. The AI learned\nfrom 70% of the data how to assign\nwarning flags. Then the accuracy\nof the warning flags was measured\non the remaining 30% of the data,\nwhich the algorithm had not seen\nbefore.\nThe AI achieves an excellent\nperformance, especially in identify\u0002ing the red projects correctly. The\nperformance is well balanced across\nthe different flags.\n53%\u201369% of all the flags\nassigned to the observations are ac\u0002curate. This means, for example, that\nif the AI assigns a red flag for a cost\noverrun the algorithm is accurate\nnearly 7 out of 10 times.\nThe accuracy of the schedule\nflags is slightly worse. Here the AI is\naccurate in its prediction 18%\u201363%\nof the time.\nThe AI outperforms the split\nby project type, which was only ac\u0002curate in 8%\u201340% of predictions.\nThe AI vastly outperforms\nrandomness. If we simply made an\nuninformed \u201clucky\u201d guess about the\nproject\u2019s risk we would get it right in\n3%\u201325% of times.\nEspecially for the very high\nrisk category \u201cred\u201d the AI is more\nthan 20\u2013times better than a lucky\nguess.\nIn addition to the valida\u0002tion with a test and training set of\nthe data, we tested how little data\nthe AI needs to achieve this level of\naccuracy. The analysis shows that is\npossible with as little as 10% of the\ndata. We were surprised by this find\u0002ing, because we always assumed that\nAI needs lots of data. It turns out we\nwere wrong. Any organisation wish\u0002ing to integrate AI into their early\n-warning-sign system needs some but\nnot vast amounts of data.\nThe AI is far from perfect;\nthe accuracy is surpsingly good even\nthough the algorithm only knew the\ncashflow and type of a project.\nAdding more data in the fu\u0002ture will certainly improve the ac\u0002curacy\n\n\n\nL O O K I N G F O R W A R D\nWITH THE AI\nP R E D I C T I N G\nCOST\nThe accuracy of the warning flag AI is promising enough to train\nmore algorithms on an even more detailed task: forecast the\noutturn cost of projects. A more complex AI, a deep artificial\nneural network, predicted the final outturn cost with an average\nerror of only \u00b18%. The accuracy is as good as a Class 1 estimate.\nThe next challenge we set for\nthe AI algorithms was to predict the\nfinal outturn cost of projects.\nThe AI only knew the per\u0002centage of progress the project had\nachieved so far, measured against the\nplanned project duration at final in\u0002vestment decision and the cashflow\nspent to date as percentage of the\nbudget, that was approved at the fi\u0002nal investment decision.\nFor this challenge we tested\nmany different AI and non-AI algo\u0002rithms, including linear regressions,\nsupport vector machines, gradient\nboosters, random forrest regressions,\nk-nearest neighbours, multilayer\npercepetrons, simple deep neural\nnetworks and complex deep neural\nnetworks.\nWe measured the error of the\npredicted outturn cost in the train\u0002ing data, which tells us how good\nthe AI is at summarising the data it\nknows. We then gave the AI unseen\ndata to test the prediction. As before,\nthe AI used 70% of the data to train\nand 30% for testing.\nThe best performing algo\u0002rithm was the simple deep neural\nnetwork. The mean squared error\nof the predictions for the test data\nwas 1.6 percentage points. The mean\nabsolute error in the test data was 7.9\npercentage points.\nThis means that on aver\u0002age the forecasted outturn cost was\nwithin \u00b18% at the portfolio level.\nThe mean squared error, which is\nsimilar to the standard deviation, is\nonly \u00b11.6%, thus 68% of predictions\nare within a range of \u00b11.6%, 95%\nof predictions are within a range\nof \u00b13.2% and 99.7% of predictions\nare within \u00b14.8% of the predicted\ncost. The mean absolute error of the\nprediction is \u00b17.9%, therefore an\nindication of the skew in the data,\nwhere very large overruns and fat\ntails are not uncommon.\nThe AI estimate is in line\nwith what conventional cost esti\u0002mation practice considers to be the\nbest cost estimate achievable. The\nAssociation for the Advancement of\nCost Engineering (AACE) suggests\nthat international best practice for\na best-in-class cost estimate has an\nerror between \u00b13% and \u00b115%; to\nachieve an estimate with this narrow\nerror range, 100% of design needs to\nbe completed and detailed informa\u0002tion of unit cost and prices needs to\nbe available. The estimate of the AI\nfalls within the range expected for a\nClass 1 cost estimate.\n\n\n\n\nCASE STUDIES\nSPOTTING RISK\nALL HONG KONG PROJECTS ARE MONITORED BY THE PSS.\nTHESE ARE TWO REAL-LIFE CASES WHERE THE AI SPOTTED RISKY\nPROJECTS EARLY\nWe selected two capital works projects from the portfolio to run the AI analyses. Project 1 has an approved project\ncost estimate (APE) of HKD 5.2bn with completion within 3.5 years. Project 2 has an approved budget of HKD\n1.3bn with a construction duration of 3.9 years. Project 1 has completed its first year of construction. Project 2\nhas completed its first two years of construction.\nThe latest cashflow information shows that project 1 has spent 1% of its cash and is nearly 29% complete when\nmeasured against the originally planned duration. Project 2 is 51% complete and has spent 21% of its cash.\nFirst, the AI assigned warning flags. Project 1 has a red flag. Project 1 has been spending the budget slower than\nthe AI anticipates based on the typical spending pattern of capital works projects in Hong Kong. The project\u2019s own\nforecast of spend (dotted line) shows\nthat this trend will reverse in the next\ntwo years and exceed usual patterns\nin years 4 and 5. The AI\u2019s flag raises\nquestions about this unusual profile\nof acceleration and suggests further\ninvestigation.\nProject 2 receives a yellow flag. The\nproject is spending its budget more\nslowly than typical projects but it\nforecasts that it will soon be in line\nwith others. The schedule flags show a similar pattern. Project 1 gets a red\nflag for being very late if it can keep\nup the expenditure as is (under the\nassumption that this is not indicating\na big cost underrun).\nProject 2 is progressing like a typical\nproject in Hong Kong and the AI as\u0002signed a green schedule flag. But the\nAI raises questions about the plans\nafter year 5.\nThe AI also produces a cost forecast\nof the final outturn cost. At the mo- ment Project 1 is forecasted to cost\nHKD 4.0bn. For this estimate, the\nAI assumes that the project will not\nfollow its own forecasted trajectory\nbut behave more like a typical project\nin the future. However, the unusual\npattern of expenditure means that if\nthe project does indeed accelerate its\nspend the cost are likely HKD 5.1bn\nclose to the APE. Project 2 has similar issues. The AI forecasts outturn\ncost of HKD 1.0bn. The project\u2019s\nown forecasts show a spike in spending near the end; if that holds true\nthe AI forecasts spending of HKD\n1.3bn. Again the readiness for acceleration should be investigated.\n\n\nThe enhancement of the PSS does not stop here. Our future plans\ninclude adding more detailed project data, further developing\nthe AI to enhance the predictive power and extending the PSS to\nrailway projects in collaboration with other international regions. Our innovations will not only support Hong Kong\u2019s ambi\u0002tious vision but also benefit projects worldwide.\n\n\nThe Structure is below\n\nSlide 1: Title Slide\n- Project Title: \u201cAI in Action: How the Hong Kong Development Bureau Built the PSS \u2014 An Early-Warning Sign System for Public Works Projects\u201d\n\nSlide 2: Introduction\n- Brief project overview\n- Team members and their respective contributions\n\nSlide 3: Brainstorming Techniques\n- Explain the importance of brainstorming in developing creative solutions\n- Describe different brainstorming techniques used in the project\n\nSlide 4: Hofstede\u2019s Cultural Dimensions\n- Introduce Hofstede\u2019s Cultural Dimensions Theory\n- Analyze cultural differences and challenges in the Hong Kong construction industry and project management\n- Explain their impact on the project\n\nSlide 5: Challenges\n- Present the challenges faced by Hong Kong\u2019s construction industry\n- Discuss the increasing project costs and risks in megaprojects\n\nSlide 6: Existing System (PSS)\n- Describe the Project Supervision System (PSS) and its role in monitoring capital works projects\n- Explain how it raises different levels of warning flags and follow-up actions\n\nSlide 7: AI in PSS\n- Introduce the idea of incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the PSS\n- Describe the benefits of using AI for early-warning signs and project monitoring\n\nSlide 8: AI Algorithm and Data Analysis\n- Outline the AI algorithms used and the data analysis process\n- Explain how AI helps in predicting project outcomes and identifying risky projects\n\nSlide 9: AI Results and Accuracy\n- Present the accuracy of the AI\u2019s predictions for warning flags and outturn costs\n- Explain the performance and potential improvement of the AI\n\nSlide 10: Case Studies\n- Describe two real-life case studies where the AI spotted risky projects early\n- Explain the AI\u2019s role in predicting the outcomes and raising warning flags for these projects\n\nSlide 11: Future Enhancements\n- Discuss plans for adding more detailed project data and improving the AI\u2019s predictive power\n- Explain the potential benefits of extending the PSS to railway projects and other international regions\n\nSlide 12: Conclusion\n- Summarize the value of incorporating AI in the PSS\n- Emphasize the potential benefits to the Hong Kong construction industry and the global project management field\n\nSlide 13: Questions and Answers\n- Open for questions from the audience and provide answers\n\n\n\nNow, as detailed as possible, give me all the info needed for slide 9"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Slide 9: AI Results and Accuracy\n\nTitle: AI Results and Accuracy\n\n- AI in predicting warning flags:\n  -

However, ten per cent of local projects over-run\ntheir budgets, with a total overspend of eight percent.\nSome flagship projects have over-run their budgets and\ncompletion dates, causing public embarrassment.\nIt is crucial to get these cost and schedule estimates under\ncontrol in order that the booming infrastructure environ\u0002ment in Hong Kong can flourish to its potential while\ncarefully monitoring costs and performance.\nWe investigated whether Artificial Intelligence (AI) can play\na part in accurately predicting these outcomes and identify\u0002ing ahead of time when a project is going off track, allowing\nearly intervention.\nThe large volume of projects in Hong Kong needs to be mon\u0002itored collectively, with a system that allows leaders to focus\ntheir efforts on the projects most likely to fail. An automated\nsystem simplifies this process, and in our studies was found\nto be as accurate as the best-in-class human cost estimates.\nHigh quality data is available in Hong Kong, and we stud\u0002ied a total of 2,700 years of combined construction activity\nand HKD 450bn in construction spent to trial this innova\u0002tive project management approach. We unexpectedly discov\u0002ered, however, that the AI needs only a very small amount\nof data in order to make good predictions.\nWE BELIEVE THESE EARLY FINDINGS WILL\nINFORM A NEW APPROACH TO PROJECT PERFOR\u0002MANCE MONITORING AND LEAD THE WAY IN\nCAPITAL WORKS PROJECTS INTERNATIONALLY\n\n\n\nTHE CHALLENGE\nHong Kong expects project spending to increase by 42% between\n2021 and 2031. The expected annual expenditure will reach up to\nHKD 325bn by 2031.\nHowever, these projects are not without their problems.\nTo spot challenges early, the Project Strategy and Governance\nOffice established a system to support supervision and govern\u0002ance of projects by providing early-warning signals to senior\nleaders of projects that are at risk.\nProjects are used to deliver the\nmost significant initiatives in the world;\nfrom the Olympics, the artificial island\nof Lantau, to the International Space\nStation.\nOne of the challenges currently\nfaced by project leaders and investors is\nthat projects do not perform well.\nThey underperform in terms\nof execution, with significant cost and\nschedule overruns. 50% delays are com\u0002mon.\nOur research has shown this\nwoeful underperformance is so con\u0002sistent that we\u2019ve coined the iron law\nof megaprojects: they are \u2018over budget,\nover time, over and over again\u2019.\nThis poor performance is not a\nrecent phenomenon: it has been fairly\nconsistent for over 70 years. It is also\ncommon to different countries, sectors\nand delivery in the private and public\nsectors.\nThe scale of projects has been\nincreasing for decades. The largest\nmegaprojects have budgets that match\nthe gross domestic products of the larg\u0002est countries.\nThe GDP of Hong Kong\nin 2020 was USD 347bn, a similar\namount to the budget for China\u2019s high\nspeed rail of USD 300bn and the USA\u2019s\njoint strike fighter (USD 400bn). This\nlarge scale means that it is crucial for\nthe money spent on projects to be better\nmanaged.\nThe impacts of funds of this\nsize being mismanaged can be felt on\na national and even international scale.\nOver the period 2008 to 2017, performance on Government projects\nunder the Capital Works Programme\nhas generally been to a good standard, particularly from a budget perspective. Although certain projects\nrequired additional funding owing\nto project specific circumstances, the\nmajority of approved projects were\ndelivered at or under the original\nApproved Project Estimates (APE).\nAdditional funding was required in approximately 10% of the\nprojects and the amount represented\nsome 8% of the total provision of\nthese projects.\nAlso of importance, this period of time was particularly active\nfor the Industry, with approximately\n850 Category A projects having their\nfinal accounts settled. In terms of\ncost, the original APE of these projects totalled approximately HKD\n240bn as compared with cumulative final accounts of approximately\nHKD 210bn \u2013 leading to an overall\nsurplus of HKD 30bn.\nEffectively, this means the\nsurplus generated at the portfolio\nlevel was more than able to offset\nthe cost overruns incurred by a select\nnumber of projects.\nTo reinforce the positive nature of this performance, Professor\nBent Flyvbjerg of the University of\nOxford pointed out that Hong Kong\nis better than many other regions\nwhen it comes to project cost estimation, based on his findings in a study\ncovering over 100 international jurisdictions.\nMegaprojects are those that\ncome with high levels of procurement, design and/or construction\ncomplexity as well as scale. They\ntypically take multiple years to implement and often involve high levels\nof risk to the participants involved.\nUnfortunately, a number of complex\nmegaprojects in Hong Kong have\nsuffered from underperformance in\nthe form of delays, cost overruns\nand/or quality failures in recent\nyears. These incidents have been\nwell documented through extensive\nmedia coverage \u2013 leading to reduced\nlevels of public confidence in the in\u0002dustry.\nThe early stages of a project\nare crucial and can set the tone and\ninfluence its efficacy. One of the\nchallenges of project performance\nis the sensitivity to timescales in taking corrective action. The later such\nactions are undertaken, the harder\nand more resource intensive it is to\nrectify problems.\nHowever, it is not always\neasy to identify risky projects before\nthings have gone wrong and they re\u0002quire substantial and costly remedy.\nThe Construction Industry Council\nestimates that construction expenditure will increase in real terms by up\nto 42% to HKD 325bn, compared\nto 2021. The Development Bureau\nof the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has launched their\nvision for Construction 2.0 to support effective delivery.\nA key policy objective of the\nDevelopment Bureau is \u2018to ensure\nthe effective planning, management\nand implementation of public sector infrastructure development and\nworks programmes in a safe, timely\nand cost-effective manner and to\nmaintain high quality and standards.\u2019\nIn order to do this, it is vital\nfor senior managers to notice problems and ensure efficient, effective\nand timely intervention when necessary. However, senior managers lack\nthe daily and deep involvement in\ntheir projects. They need the right\nmonitoring tools and early-warning\n-sign systems to help them in their\nproject supervision.\n\n\nTHE EXISTING SYSTEM\nEARLY WARNINGS\nA WEB-BASED MONITORING SYSTEM BASED\nON CASHFLOWS OF HISTORIC PROJECTS\nThe Development Bureau\nuses the PSS, or Project Supervision\nSystem, to monitor capital works\nprojects and provide early-warning\nsignals to senior management. The\nPSS is a web-based application comprising a series of standardized project cashflow graphs.\nThe graphs are based on the\npast cashflows of capital works projects. The PSS covers different categories for building and non-building\nprojects with various construction\ndurations.\nAll active projects submit\ntheir actual cashflows to date and\ntheir planned cashflows for the remainder of the project. The PSS uses\nthis information to identify any unusual patterns.\nThere are 3 types of patterns\nwhich then trigger different followup actions.\nFirst, normal performance.\nThe project cashflow falls within the\ngreen zone. There is no follow-up\naction for projects with normal performance. The data of these projects\nwill be stored for future use and refinement of the system.\nSecond, yellow performance\nraises an alert. The project cashflow\nfalls within the yellow zone, meaning\nheads of departments need to review\nthese projects. The review takes in the\nrisk of cost overrun and programme\ndelay. The heads of departments are\nresponsible for the project assessment\nand, if necessary, for the planning\nand implementation of appropriate\nrecovery measures.\nThird, red performance flags\nthe strongest warning. When the\nproject cashflow falls within the red\nzone, the Permanent Secretary for\nDevelopment (Works) chairs a top\nmanagement meeting, which monitors all projects in this category.\n\nThe monitoring system\nprovides a better understanding of\nvarious elements of a project\u2019s performance. Here are some insightful\nexamples from the first year of using\nthe system.\nThe first project falls into the\nlower yellow zone, which indicates\nslow progress. The question to investigate is whether the project might\nbe able to take actions to catch up\n(purple dotted line), or will be delayed (blue dotted line).\nThe second project falls\ninto the upper yellow zone, which\nindicates fast progress or cost overrun. The team needs to investigate\nwhether the project is indeed making very good progress and will be\ncompleted early (purple dotted line),\nor if the project will experience cost\noverrun (blue dotted line). In either\ncase project plans and budgets might\nneed to be adjusted as a result of the\ninvestigation.\nThe third project falls into\nthe lower red zone and has stayed\npersistently in this zone for more\nthan a year.\nThis can signal a very long\ndelay or an overinflated budget due\nto excessive contingency. In this case,\nthe team investigated the project indepth and found that the project carried too much contingency.\nThe project team reviewed\nthe cost and developed a more realistic project budget. Once the cashflow\nwas adjusted according to the new\nbudget, the cashflow fell back into\nthe normal zone.\n\n\n\nAfter using our monitoring system for over a year, we discovered\nthat instead of it being a mere monitoring tool, the system\nprovides a benchmark and even means to set better target for the\nproject teams\u2019 delivery of their projects. The data of these\nprojects, once completed, will form part of the database\ncreating a self-learning and self-updating system. Hong Kong\u2019s\nproject governance will be enhanced by the positive and\ninteractive feedback between the PSS and the ongoing projects.\n\n\n\nTHE DATA\nThese closed projects have a total outturn cost of HKD 460bn (in\n2019 HKD terms) and individual projects range from HKD 10m to 13bn.\nThe mean project value is HKD 550m.\nThe project durations range from 10 months to 18 years, with an\naverage 3-year duration. In total, the portfolio contains more than 2,700\nyears of construction activity.\nThe average project costs 15% less than forecast, and the range of\ncost outcomes is from 69% below the budget to 59% over budget. There\u2019s\na far greater range in project duration, ranging from 41% shorter than\nplanned to 317% longer than planned. The average delay is 34% for the\ndelayed projects.\nThe historic 2008-17 dataset is representative of current perfor\u0002mance, according to the Development Bureau\u2019s response to the Legislative\nCouncil for projects in 2018-19.\n\n\n\nFIRST FINDING OF THE AI\nPROJECT TYPES\nAI ALGORITHM IDENTIFIED THE GROUPINGS OF PROJECTS THAT\nHAVE A DISTINCTIVE CASHFLOW PATTERN\nTo analyse the cashflow data,\ntwo methods were selected: tracking\nannual performance as a percentage\nof the (1) outturn performance and\n(2) the original plan.\nA relative timeline was de\u0002termined for each project, with the\npercentage of the total duration as\u0002signed to each year. For instance, in a\nfour-year project the first year would\nhave 25% progress, the second 50%\netc.\nThe data for the analysis\ncomprised completed projects con\u0002taining actual outcomes, but the\nforecasted outcomes will be used\nin the future, so the dual reporting\nwill reflect cost and schedule perfor\u0002mance as a percentage of the most\nrecent forecast and the original plan.\nThe analysis used random\nforrests, an artificial intelligence\nmethod to analyse the data. This un\u0002supervised learning algorithm con\u0002sidered all possible characteristics to\ngroup the projects then extracted the\ntypical cashflows from the s-curves\nand compared the fit of the curves.\nAnalysis of the PSS identi\u0002fied that four types of projects had\nstatistically significantly different\noutcomes. The analysis resulted in\na decision tree, where the first deci\u0002sion divides all projects along the\nlines of building or non-building\nprojects. Then the building projects\nare categorised by whether the origi\u0002nal budget was smaller than HKD\n150m or not and the non-building\nprojects were categorised by whether\nthe planned duration was less than\nsix years or not.\n\n\nRESULTS FROM THE AI\nW A R N I N G\nFLAGS\nEach project was assigned a\nwarning flag status; red, amber or\ngreen based on the outcome of the\nproject. If the project finished in the\nmiddle 40% of the historic projects\n(30th\u201370th percentile) the project\ngot a green flag. The bottom and\ntop 5% of the project got a red flag\n(<5th or >95th percentile). All other\nprojects got an amber warning flag\n(5th\u201330th and 70th\u201395th percen\u0002tile).\nAfter assigning the warning\nflag based on the project outcomes\nwe trained three AI algorithms\n(gradient booster, neural network, rolling discretizer) to find out the\nwarning flag status based on progress\nand cashflows.\nThe first AI assigns a warning flag for cost performance. The\nalgorithm looks at progress and then\nthe share of dispensed cash to date\nThe second AI assigns a\nwarning flag for schedule perfor\u0002mance. The algorithm looks at the\nshare of dispensed cash and then at\nthe progress made\nThe rolling discretizer, an algorithm specifically created for this task, achieved the most accurate\npredictions in unseen test data. To\nvalidate the predictive power of the\nalgorithm the data were split into a\ntraining and a test set. The AI learned\nfrom 70% of the data how to assign\nwarning flags. Then the accuracy\nof the warning flags was measured\non the remaining 30% of the data,\nwhich the algorithm had not seen\nbefore.\nThe AI achieves an excellent\nperformance, especially in identify\u0002ing the red projects correctly. The\nperformance is well balanced across\nthe different flags.\n53%\u201369% of all the flags\nassigned to the observations are ac\u0002curate. This means, for example, that\nif the AI assigns a red flag for a cost\noverrun the algorithm is accurate\nnearly 7 out of 10 times.\nThe accuracy of the schedule\nflags is slightly worse. Here the AI is\naccurate in its prediction 18%\u201363%\nof the time.\nThe AI outperforms the split\nby project type, which was only ac\u0002curate in 8%\u201340% of predictions.\nThe AI vastly outperforms\nrandomness. If we simply made an\nuninformed \u201clucky\u201d guess about the\nproject\u2019s risk we would get it right in\n3%\u201325% of times.\nEspecially for the very high\nrisk category \u201cred\u201d the AI is more\nthan 20\u2013times better than a lucky\nguess.\nIn addition to the valida\u0002tion with a test and training set of\nthe data, we tested how little data\nthe AI needs to achieve this level of\naccuracy. The analysis shows that is\npossible with as little as 10% of the\ndata. We were surprised by this find\u0002ing, because we always assumed that\nAI needs lots of data. It turns out we\nwere wrong. Any organisation wish\u0002ing to integrate AI into their early\n-warning-sign system needs some but\nnot vast amounts of data.\nThe AI is far from perfect;\nthe accuracy is surpsingly good even\nthough the algorithm only knew the\ncashflow and type of a project.\nAdding more data in the fu\u0002ture will certainly improve the ac\u0002curacy\n\n\n\nL O O K I N G F O R W A R D\nWITH THE AI\nP R E D I C T I N G\nCOST\nThe accuracy of the warning flag AI is promising enough to train\nmore algorithms on an even more detailed task: forecast the\noutturn cost of projects. A more complex AI, a deep artificial\nneural network, predicted the final outturn cost with an average\nerror of only \u00b18%. The accuracy is as good as a Class 1 estimate.\nThe next challenge we set for\nthe AI algorithms was to predict the\nfinal outturn cost of projects.\nThe AI only knew the per\u0002centage of progress the project had\nachieved so far, measured against the\nplanned project duration at final in\u0002vestment decision and the cashflow\nspent to date as percentage of the\nbudget, that was approved at the fi\u0002nal investment decision.\nFor this challenge we tested\nmany different AI and non-AI algo\u0002rithms, including linear regressions,\nsupport vector machines, gradient\nboosters, random forrest regressions,\nk-nearest neighbours, multilayer\npercepetrons, simple deep neural\nnetworks and complex deep neural\nnetworks.\nWe measured the error of the\npredicted outturn cost in the train\u0002ing data, which tells us how good\nthe AI is at summarising the data it\nknows. We then gave the AI unseen\ndata to test the prediction. As before,\nthe AI used 70% of the data to train\nand 30% for testing.\nThe best performing algo\u0002rithm was the simple deep neural\nnetwork. The mean squared error\nof the predictions for the test data\nwas 1.6 percentage points. The mean\nabsolute error in the test data was 7.9\npercentage points.\nThis means that on aver\u0002age the forecasted outturn cost was\nwithin \u00b18% at the portfolio level.\nThe mean squared error, which is\nsimilar to the standard deviation, is\nonly \u00b11.6%, thus 68% of predictions\nare within a range of \u00b11.6%, 95%\nof predictions are within a range\nof \u00b13.2% and 99.7% of predictions\nare within \u00b14.8% of the predicted\ncost. The mean absolute error of the\nprediction is \u00b17.9%, therefore an\nindication of the skew in the data,\nwhere very large overruns and fat\ntails are not uncommon.\nThe AI estimate is in line\nwith what conventional cost esti\u0002mation practice considers to be the\nbest cost estimate achievable. The\nAssociation for the Advancement of\nCost Engineering (AACE) suggests\nthat international best practice for\na best-in-class cost estimate has an\nerror between \u00b13% and \u00b115%; to\nachieve an estimate with this narrow\nerror range, 100% of design needs to\nbe completed and detailed informa\u0002tion of unit cost and prices needs to\nbe available. The estimate of the AI\nfalls within the range expected for a\nClass 1 cost estimate.\n\n\n\n\nCASE STUDIES\nSPOTTING RISK\nALL HONG KONG PROJECTS ARE MONITORED BY THE PSS.\nTHESE ARE TWO REAL-LIFE CASES WHERE THE AI SPOTTED RISKY\nPROJECTS EARLY\nWe selected two capital works projects from the portfolio to run the AI analyses. Project 1 has an approved project\ncost estimate (APE) of HKD 5.2bn with completion within 3.5 years. Project 2 has an approved budget of HKD\n1.3bn with a construction duration of 3.9 years. Project 1 has completed its first year of construction. Project 2\nhas completed its first two years of construction.\nThe latest cashflow information shows that project 1 has spent 1% of its cash and is nearly 29% complete when\nmeasured against the originally planned duration. Project 2 is 51% complete and has spent 21% of its cash.\nFirst, the AI assigned warning flags. Project 1 has a red flag. Project 1 has been spending the budget slower than\nthe AI anticipates based on the typical spending pattern of capital works projects in Hong Kong. The project\u2019s own\nforecast of spend (dotted line) shows\nthat this trend will reverse in the next\ntwo years and exceed usual patterns\nin years 4 and 5. The AI\u2019s flag raises\nquestions about this unusual profile\nof acceleration and suggests further\ninvestigation.\nProject 2 receives a yellow flag. The\nproject is spending its budget more\nslowly than typical projects but it\nforecasts that it will soon be in line\nwith others. The schedule flags show a similar pattern. Project 1 gets a red\nflag for being very late if it can keep\nup the expenditure as is (under the\nassumption that this is not indicating\na big cost underrun).\nProject 2 is progressing like a typical\nproject in Hong Kong and the AI as\u0002signed a green schedule flag. But the\nAI raises questions about the plans\nafter year 5.\nThe AI also produces a cost forecast\nof the final outturn cost. At the mo- ment Project 1 is forecasted to cost\nHKD 4.0bn. For this estimate, the\nAI assumes that the project will not\nfollow its own forecasted trajectory\nbut behave more like a typical project\nin the future. However, the unusual\npattern of expenditure means that if\nthe project does indeed accelerate its\nspend the cost are likely HKD 5.1bn\nclose to the APE. Project 2 has similar issues. The AI forecasts outturn\ncost of HKD 1.0bn. The project\u2019s\nown forecasts show a spike in spending near the end; if that holds true\nthe AI forecasts spending of HKD\n1.3bn. Again the readiness for acceleration should be investigated.\n\n\nThe enhancement of the PSS does not stop here. Our future plans\ninclude adding more detailed project data, further developing\nthe AI to enhance the predictive power and extending the PSS to\nrailway projects in collaboration with other international regions. Our innovations will not only support Hong Kong\u2019s ambi\u0002tious vision but also benefit projects worldwide.\n\n\nThe Structure is below\n\nSlide 1: Title Slide\n\nSlide 2: Introduction\n- Brief project overview\n- Objective of the presentation\n- Outline of presentation sections and team member responsibilities\n\nSlide 3: Project Background\n- Brief description of the chosen global project\n- Problem statement / goal of the project\n- Countries or locations involved\n\nSlide 4: Brainstorming Techniques - Introduction\n- Importance of creative brainstorming in global projects\n- Brief overview of selected brainstorming techniques\n\nSlides 5-9: Brainstorming Techniques \u2013 Details\n- Explanation of each selected brainstorming technique (one technique per slide) with respect to the project.

However, ten per cent of local projects over-run\ntheir budgets, with a total overspend of eight percent.\nSome flagship projects have over-run their budgets and\ncompletion dates, causing public embarrassment.\nIt is crucial to get these cost and schedule estimates under\ncontrol in order that the booming infrastructure environ\u0002ment in Hong Kong can flourish to its potential while\ncarefully monitoring costs and performance.\nWe investigated whether Artificial Intelligence (AI) can play\na part in accurately predicting these outcomes and identify\u0002ing ahead of time when a project is going off track, allowing\nearly intervention.\nThe large volume of projects in Hong Kong needs to be mon\u0002itored collectively, with a system that allows leaders to focus\ntheir efforts on the projects most likely to fail. An automated\nsystem simplifies this process, and in our studies was found\nto be as accurate as the best-in-class human cost estimates.\nHigh quality data is available in Hong Kong, and we stud\u0002ied a total of 2,700 years of combined construction activity\nand HKD 450bn in construction spent to trial this innova\u0002tive project management approach. We unexpectedly discov\u0002ered, however, that the AI needs only a very small amount\nof data in order to make good predictions.\nWE BELIEVE THESE EARLY FINDINGS WILL\nINFORM A NEW APPROACH TO PROJECT PERFOR\u0002MANCE MONITORING AND LEAD THE WAY IN\nCAPITAL WORKS PROJECTS INTERNATIONALLY\n\n\n\nTHE CHALLENGE\nHong Kong expects project spending to increase by 42% between\n2021 and 2031. The expected annual expenditure will reach up to\nHKD 325bn by 2031.\nHowever, these projects are not without their problems.\nTo spot challenges early, the Project Strategy and Governance\nOffice established a system to support supervision and govern\u0002ance of projects by providing early-warning signals to senior\nleaders of projects that are at risk.\nProjects are used to deliver the\nmost significant initiatives in the world;\nfrom the Olympics, the artificial island\nof Lantau, to the International Space\nStation.\nOne of the challenges currently\nfaced by project leaders and investors is\nthat projects do not perform well.\nThey underperform in terms\nof execution, with significant cost and\nschedule overruns. 50% delays are com\u0002mon.\nOur research has shown this\nwoeful underperformance is so con\u0002sistent that we\u2019ve coined the iron law\nof megaprojects: they are \u2018over budget,\nover time, over and over again\u2019.\nThis poor performance is not a\nrecent phenomenon: it has been fairly\nconsistent for over 70 years. It is also\ncommon to different countries, sectors\nand delivery in the private and public\nsectors.\nThe scale of projects has been\nincreasing for decades. The largest\nmegaprojects have budgets that match\nthe gross domestic products of the larg\u0002est countries.\nThe GDP of Hong Kong\nin 2020 was USD 347bn, a similar\namount to the budget for China\u2019s high\nspeed rail of USD 300bn and the USA\u2019s\njoint strike fighter (USD 400bn). This\nlarge scale means that it is crucial for\nthe money spent on projects to be better\nmanaged.\nThe impacts of funds of this\nsize being mismanaged can be felt on\na national and even international scale.\nOver the period 2008 to 2017, performance on Government projects\nunder the Capital Works Programme\nhas generally been to a good standard, particularly from a budget perspective. Although certain projects\nrequired additional funding owing\nto project specific circumstances, the\nmajority of approved projects were\ndelivered at or under the original\nApproved Project Estimates (APE).\nAdditional funding was required in approximately 10% of the\nprojects and the amount represented\nsome 8% of the total provision of\nthese projects.\nAlso of importance, this period of time was particularly active\nfor the Industry, with approximately\n850 Category A projects having their\nfinal accounts settled. In terms of\ncost, the original APE of these projects totalled approximately HKD\n240bn as compared with cumulative final accounts of approximately\nHKD 210bn \u2013 leading to an overall\nsurplus of HKD 30bn.\nEffectively, this means the\nsurplus generated at the portfolio\nlevel was more than able to offset\nthe cost overruns incurred by a select\nnumber of projects.\nTo reinforce the positive nature of this performance, Professor\nBent Flyvbjerg of the University of\nOxford pointed out that Hong Kong\nis better than many other regions\nwhen it comes to project cost estimation, based on his findings in a study\ncovering over 100 international jurisdictions.\nMegaprojects are those that\ncome with high levels of procurement, design and/or construction\ncomplexity as well as scale. They\ntypically take multiple years to implement and often involve high levels\nof risk to the participants involved.\nUnfortunately, a number of complex\nmegaprojects in Hong Kong have\nsuffered from underperformance in\nthe form of delays, cost overruns\nand/or quality failures in recent\nyears. These incidents have been\nwell documented through extensive\nmedia coverage \u2013 leading to reduced\nlevels of public confidence in the in\u0002dustry.\nThe early stages of a project\nare crucial and can set the tone and\ninfluence its efficacy. One of the\nchallenges of project performance\nis the sensitivity to timescales in taking corrective action. The later such\nactions are undertaken, the harder\nand more resource intensive it is to\nrectify problems.\nHowever, it is not always\neasy to identify risky projects before\nthings have gone wrong and they re\u0002quire substantial and costly remedy.\nThe Construction Industry Council\nestimates that construction expenditure will increase in real terms by up\nto 42% to HKD 325bn, compared\nto 2021. The Development Bureau\nof the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has launched their\nvision for Construction 2.0 to support effective delivery.\nA key policy objective of the\nDevelopment Bureau is \u2018to ensure\nthe effective planning, management\nand implementation of public sector infrastructure development and\nworks programmes in a safe, timely\nand cost-effective manner and to\nmaintain high quality and standards.\u2019\nIn order to do this, it is vital\nfor senior managers to notice problems and ensure efficient, effective\nand timely intervention when necessary. However, senior managers lack\nthe daily and deep involvement in\ntheir projects. They need the right\nmonitoring tools and early-warning\n-sign systems to help them in their\nproject supervision.\n\n\nTHE EXISTING SYSTEM\nEARLY WARNINGS\nA WEB-BASED MONITORING SYSTEM BASED\nON CASHFLOWS OF HISTORIC PROJECTS\nThe Development Bureau\nuses the PSS, or Project Supervision\nSystem, to monitor capital works\nprojects and provide early-warning\nsignals to senior management. The\nPSS is a web-based application comprising a series of standardized project cashflow graphs.\nThe graphs are based on the\npast cashflows of capital works projects. The PSS covers different categories for building and non-building\nprojects with various construction\ndurations.\nAll active projects submit\ntheir actual cashflows to date and\ntheir planned cashflows for the remainder of the project. The PSS uses\nthis information to identify any unusual patterns.\nThere are 3 types of patterns\nwhich then trigger different followup actions.\nFirst, normal performance.\nThe project cashflow falls within the\ngreen zone. There is no follow-up\naction for projects with normal performance. The data of these projects\nwill be stored for future use and refinement of the system.\nSecond, yellow performance\nraises an alert. The project cashflow\nfalls within the yellow zone, meaning\nheads of departments need to review\nthese projects. The review takes in the\nrisk of cost overrun and programme\ndelay. The heads of departments are\nresponsible for the project assessment\nand, if necessary, for the planning\nand implementation of appropriate\nrecovery measures.\nThird, red performance flags\nthe strongest warning. When the\nproject cashflow falls within the red\nzone, the Permanent Secretary for\nDevelopment (Works) chairs a top\nmanagement meeting, which monitors all projects in this category.\n\nThe monitoring system\nprovides a better understanding of\nvarious elements of a project\u2019s performance. Here are some insightful\nexamples from the first year of using\nthe system.\nThe first project falls into the\nlower yellow zone, which indicates\nslow progress. The question to investigate is whether the project might\nbe able to take actions to catch up\n(purple dotted line), or will be delayed (blue dotted line).\nThe second project falls\ninto the upper yellow zone, which\nindicates fast progress or cost overrun. The team needs to investigate\nwhether the project is indeed making very good progress and will be\ncompleted early (purple dotted line),\nor if the project will experience cost\noverrun (blue dotted line). In either\ncase project plans and budgets might\nneed to be adjusted as a result of the\ninvestigation.\nThe third project falls into\nthe lower red zone and has stayed\npersistently in this zone for more\nthan a year.\nThis can signal a very long\ndelay or an overinflated budget due\nto excessive contingency. In this case,\nthe team investigated the project indepth and found that the project carried too much contingency.\nThe project team reviewed\nthe cost and developed a more realistic project budget. Once the cashflow\nwas adjusted according to the new\nbudget, the cashflow fell back into\nthe normal zone.\n\n\n\nAfter using our monitoring system for over a year, we discovered\nthat instead of it being a mere monitoring tool, the system\nprovides a benchmark and even means to set better target for the\nproject teams\u2019 delivery of their projects. The data of these\nprojects, once completed, will form part of the database\ncreating a self-learning and self-updating system. Hong Kong\u2019s\nproject governance will be enhanced by the positive and\ninteractive feedback between the PSS and the ongoing projects.\n\n\n\nTHE DATA\nThese closed projects have a total outturn cost of HKD 460bn (in\n2019 HKD terms) and individual projects range from HKD 10m to 13bn.\nThe mean project value is HKD 550m.\nThe project durations range from 10 months to 18 years, with an\naverage 3-year duration. In total, the portfolio contains more than 2,700\nyears of construction activity.\nThe average project costs 15% less than forecast, and the range of\ncost outcomes is from 69% below the budget to 59% over budget. There\u2019s\na far greater range in project duration, ranging from 41% shorter than\nplanned to 317% longer than planned. The average delay is 34% for the\ndelayed projects.\nThe historic 2008-17 dataset is representative of current perfor\u0002mance, according to the Development Bureau\u2019s response to the Legislative\nCouncil for projects in 2018-19.\n\n\n\nFIRST FINDING OF THE AI\nPROJECT TYPES\nAI ALGORITHM IDENTIFIED THE GROUPINGS OF PROJECTS THAT\nHAVE A DISTINCTIVE CASHFLOW PATTERN\nTo analyse the cashflow data,\ntwo methods were selected: tracking\nannual performance as a percentage\nof the (1) outturn performance and\n(2) the original plan.\nA relative timeline was de\u0002termined for each project, with the\npercentage of the total duration as\u0002signed to each year. For instance, in a\nfour-year project the first year would\nhave 25% progress, the second 50%\netc.\nThe data for the analysis\ncomprised completed projects con\u0002taining actual outcomes, but the\nforecasted outcomes will be used\nin the future, so the dual reporting\nwill reflect cost and schedule perfor\u0002mance as a percentage of the most\nrecent forecast and the original plan.\nThe analysis used random\nforrests, an artificial intelligence\nmethod to analyse the data. This un\u0002supervised learning algorithm con\u0002sidered all possible characteristics to\ngroup the projects then extracted the\ntypical cashflows from the s-curves\nand compared the fit of the curves.\nAnalysis of the PSS identi\u0002fied that four types of projects had\nstatistically significantly different\noutcomes. The analysis resulted in\na decision tree, where the first deci\u0002sion divides all projects along the\nlines of building or non-building\nprojects. Then the building projects\nare categorised by whether the origi\u0002nal budget was smaller than HKD\n150m or not and the non-building\nprojects were categorised by whether\nthe planned duration was less than\nsix years or not.\n\n\nRESULTS FROM THE AI\nW A R N I N G\nFLAGS\nEach project was assigned a\nwarning flag status; red, amber or\ngreen based on the outcome of the\nproject. If the project finished in the\nmiddle 40% of the historic projects\n(30th\u201370th percentile) the project\ngot a green flag. The bottom and\ntop 5% of the project got a red flag\n(<5th or >95th percentile). All other\nprojects got an amber warning flag\n(5th\u201330th and 70th\u201395th percen\u0002tile).\nAfter assigning the warning\nflag based on the project outcomes\nwe trained three AI algorithms\n(gradient booster, neural network, rolling discretizer) to find out the\nwarning flag status based on progress\nand cashflows.\nThe first AI assigns a warning flag for cost performance. The\nalgorithm looks at progress and then\nthe share of dispensed cash to date\nThe second AI assigns a\nwarning flag for schedule perfor\u0002mance. The algorithm looks at the\nshare of dispensed cash and then at\nthe progress made\nThe rolling discretizer, an algorithm specifically created for this task, achieved the most accurate\npredictions in unseen test data. To\nvalidate the predictive power of the\nalgorithm the data were split into a\ntraining and a test set. The AI learned\nfrom 70% of the data how to assign\nwarning flags. Then the accuracy\nof the warning flags was measured\non the remaining 30% of the data,\nwhich the algorithm had not seen\nbefore.\nThe AI achieves an excellent\nperformance, especially in identify\u0002ing the red projects correctly. The\nperformance is well balanced across\nthe different flags.\n53%\u201369% of all the flags\nassigned to the observations are ac\u0002curate. This means, for example, that\nif the AI assigns a red flag for a cost\noverrun the algorithm is accurate\nnearly 7 out of 10 times.\nThe accuracy of the schedule\nflags is slightly worse. Here the AI is\naccurate in its prediction 18%\u201363%\nof the time.\nThe AI outperforms the split\nby project type, which was only ac\u0002curate in 8%\u201340% of predictions.\nThe AI vastly outperforms\nrandomness. If we simply made an\nuninformed \u201clucky\u201d guess about the\nproject\u2019s risk we would get it right in\n3%\u201325% of times.\nEspecially for the very high\nrisk category \u201cred\u201d the AI is more\nthan 20\u2013times better than a lucky\nguess.\nIn addition to the valida\u0002tion with a test and training set of\nthe data, we tested how little data\nthe AI needs to achieve this level of\naccuracy. The analysis shows that is\npossible with as little as 10% of the\ndata. We were surprised by this find\u0002ing, because we always assumed that\nAI needs lots of data. It turns out we\nwere wrong. Any organisation wish\u0002ing to integrate AI into their early\n-warning-sign system needs some but\nnot vast amounts of data.\nThe AI is far from perfect;\nthe accuracy is surpsingly good even\nthough the algorithm only knew the\ncashflow and type of a project.\nAdding more data in the fu\u0002ture will certainly improve the ac\u0002curacy\n\n\n\nL O O K I N G F O R W A R D\nWITH THE AI\nP R E D I C T I N G\nCOST\nThe accuracy of the warning flag AI is promising enough to train\nmore algorithms on an even more detailed task: forecast the\noutturn cost of projects. A more complex AI, a deep artificial\nneural network, predicted the final outturn cost with an average\nerror of only \u00b18%. The accuracy is as good as a Class 1 estimate.\nThe next challenge we set for\nthe AI algorithms was to predict the\nfinal outturn cost of projects.\nThe AI only knew the per\u0002centage of progress the project had\nachieved so far, measured against the\nplanned project duration at final in\u0002vestment decision and the cashflow\nspent to date as percentage of the\nbudget, that was approved at the fi\u0002nal investment decision.\nFor this challenge we tested\nmany different AI and non-AI algo\u0002rithms, including linear regressions,\nsupport vector machines, gradient\nboosters, random forrest regressions,\nk-nearest neighbours, multilayer\npercepetrons, simple deep neural\nnetworks and complex deep neural\nnetworks.\nWe measured the error of the\npredicted outturn cost in the train\u0002ing data, which tells us how good\nthe AI is at summarising the data it\nknows. We then gave the AI unseen\ndata to test the prediction. As before,\nthe AI used 70% of the data to train\nand 30% for testing.\nThe best performing algo\u0002rithm was the simple deep neural\nnetwork. The mean squared error\nof the predictions for the test data\nwas 1.6 percentage points. The mean\nabsolute error in the test data was 7.9\npercentage points.\nThis means that on aver\u0002age the forecasted outturn cost was\nwithin \u00b18% at the portfolio level.\nThe mean squared error, which is\nsimilar to the standard deviation, is\nonly \u00b11.6%, thus 68% of predictions\nare within a range of \u00b11.6%, 95%\nof predictions are within a range\nof \u00b13.2% and 99.7% of predictions\nare within \u00b14.8% of the predicted\ncost. The mean absolute error of the\nprediction is \u00b17.9%, therefore an\nindication of the skew in the data,\nwhere very large overruns and fat\ntails are not uncommon.\nThe AI estimate is in line\nwith what conventional cost esti\u0002mation practice considers to be the\nbest cost estimate achievable. The\nAssociation for the Advancement of\nCost Engineering (AACE) suggests\nthat international best practice for\na best-in-class cost estimate has an\nerror between \u00b13% and \u00b115%; to\nachieve an estimate with this narrow\nerror range, 100% of design needs to\nbe completed and detailed informa\u0002tion of unit cost and prices needs to\nbe available. The estimate of the AI\nfalls within the range expected for a\nClass 1 cost estimate.\n\n\n\n\nCASE STUDIES\nSPOTTING RISK\nALL HONG KONG PROJECTS ARE MONITORED BY THE PSS.\nTHESE ARE TWO REAL-LIFE CASES WHERE THE AI SPOTTED RISKY\nPROJECTS EARLY\nWe selected two capital works projects from the portfolio to run the AI analyses. Project 1 has an approved project\ncost estimate (APE) of HKD 5.2bn with completion within 3.5 years. Project 2 has an approved budget of HKD\n1.3bn with a construction duration of 3.9 years. Project 1 has completed its first year of construction. Project 2\nhas completed its first two years of construction.\nThe latest cashflow information shows that project 1 has spent 1% of its cash and is nearly 29% complete when\nmeasured against the originally planned duration. Project 2 is 51% complete and has spent 21% of its cash.\nFirst, the AI assigned warning flags. Project 1 has a red flag. Project 1 has been spending the budget slower than\nthe AI anticipates based on the typical spending pattern of capital works projects in Hong Kong. The project\u2019s own\nforecast of spend (dotted line) shows\nthat this trend will reverse in the next\ntwo years and exceed usual patterns\nin years 4 and 5. The AI\u2019s flag raises\nquestions about this unusual profile\nof acceleration and suggests further\ninvestigation.\nProject 2 receives a yellow flag. The\nproject is spending its budget more\nslowly than typical projects but it\nforecasts that it will soon be in line\nwith others. The schedule flags show a similar pattern. Project 1 gets a red\nflag for being very late if it can keep\nup the expenditure as is (under the\nassumption that this is not indicating\na big cost underrun).\nProject 2 is progressing like a typical\nproject in Hong Kong and the AI as\u0002signed a green schedule flag. But the\nAI raises questions about the plans\nafter year 5.\nThe AI also produces a cost forecast\nof the final outturn cost. At the mo- ment Project 1 is forecasted to cost\nHKD 4.0bn. For this estimate, the\nAI assumes that the project will not\nfollow its own forecasted trajectory\nbut behave more like a typical project\nin the future. However, the unusual\npattern of expenditure means that if\nthe project does indeed accelerate its\nspend the cost are likely HKD 5.1bn\nclose to the APE. Project 2 has similar issues. The AI forecasts outturn\ncost of HKD 1.0bn. The project\u2019s\nown forecasts show a spike in spending near the end; if that holds true\nthe AI forecasts spending of HKD\n1.3bn. Again the readiness for acceleration should be investigated.\n\n\nThe enhancement of the PSS does not stop here. Our future plans\ninclude adding more detailed project data, further developing\nthe AI to enhance the predictive power and extending the PSS to\nrailway projects in collaboration with other international regions. Our innovations will not only support Hong Kong\u2019s ambi\u0002tious vision but also benefit projects worldwide.\n\n\nThe Structure is below\n\nSlide 1: Title Slide\n\nSlide 2: Introduction\n- Brief project overview\n- Objective of the presentation\n- Outline of presentation sections and team member responsibilities\n\nSlide 3: Project Background\n- Brief description of the chosen global project\n- Problem statement / goal of the project\n- Countries or locations involved\n\nSlide 4: Brainstorming Techniques - Introduction\n- Importance of creative brainstorming in global projects\n- Brief overview of selected brainstorming techniques\n\nSlides 5-9: Brainstorming Techniques \u2013 Details\n- Explanation of each selected brainstorming technique (one technique per slide) with respect to the project.

The country is rich in copper, nickel, gold and chromite. This in turn urges large and small mining companies to exploit our resources illegally. It has always been a controversial and alarming issue that the Philippines is prone to illegal mining.

Our natural resources have depleted throughout time due to the use of unsustainable practices and products. Utilizing mercury and cyanide for fishing poisoned the country\u2019s bodies of water and its surrounding land. The government also uses illegal mining for its own purposes, and as a result, legal mining workers have begun to lose their jobs. This has had a bad influence on the reputation of our country. Residents of the area have lost their houses, families, and, most importantly, their lives. It is unfair to be paid less than the minimum wage for a work that puts one's life in danger for someone\u2019s interest.\n\nSOLUTION:\n\nALEI\nOur program is about Illegal mining. Given that many large corporations are harming our natural resources, we came up with an idea to inform people about this and urge them to take action to prevent large corporations from engaging in dangerous activities that will cause our natural resources to run out. We want to lobby a bill that will defend our natural resources from capitalists with the aid of Filipino citizens. File a lawsuit against corporations that, like mining, cause enormous harm to society and the environment.

However, ten per cent of local projects over-run\ntheir budgets, with a total overspend of eight percent.\nSome flagship projects have over-run their budgets and\ncompletion dates, causing public embarrassment.\nIt is crucial to get these cost and schedule estimates under\ncontrol in order that the booming infrastructure environ\u0002ment in Hong Kong can flourish to its potential while\ncarefully monitoring costs and performance.\nWe investigated whether Artificial Intelligence (AI) can play\na part in accurately predicting these outcomes and identify\u0002ing ahead of time when a project is going off track, allowing\nearly intervention.\nThe large volume of projects in Hong Kong needs to be mon\u0002itored collectively, with a system that allows leaders to focus\ntheir efforts on the projects most likely to fail. An automated\nsystem simplifies this process, and in our studies was found\nto be as accurate as the best-in-class human cost estimates.\nHigh quality data is available in Hong Kong, and we stud\u0002ied a total of 2,700 years of combined construction activity\nand HKD 450bn in construction spent to trial this innova\u0002tive project management approach. We unexpectedly discov\u0002ered, however, that the AI needs only a very small amount\nof data in order to make good predictions.\nWE BELIEVE THESE EARLY FINDINGS WILL\nINFORM A NEW APPROACH TO PROJECT PERFOR\u0002MANCE MONITORING AND LEAD THE WAY IN\nCAPITAL WORKS PROJECTS INTERNATIONALLY\n\n\n\nTHE CHALLENGE\nHong Kong expects project spending to increase by 42% between\n2021 and 2031. The expected annual expenditure will reach up to\nHKD 325bn by 2031.\nHowever, these projects are not without their problems.\nTo spot challenges early, the Project Strategy and Governance\nOffice established a system to support supervision and govern\u0002ance of projects by providing early-warning signals to senior\nleaders of projects that are at risk.\nProjects are used to deliver the\nmost significant initiatives in the world;\nfrom the Olympics, the artificial island\nof Lantau, to the International Space\nStation.\nOne of the challenges currently\nfaced by project leaders and investors is\nthat projects do not perform well.\nThey underperform in terms\nof execution, with significant cost and\nschedule overruns. 50% delays are com\u0002mon.\nOur research has shown this\nwoeful underperformance is so con\u0002sistent that we\u2019ve coined the iron law\nof megaprojects: they are \u2018over budget,\nover time, over and over again\u2019.\nThis poor performance is not a\nrecent phenomenon: it has been fairly\nconsistent for over 70 years. It is also\ncommon to different countries, sectors\nand delivery in the private and public\nsectors.\nThe scale of projects has been\nincreasing for decades. The largest\nmegaprojects have budgets that match\nthe gross domestic products of the larg\u0002est countries.\nThe GDP of Hong Kong\nin 2020 was USD 347bn, a similar\namount to the budget for China\u2019s high\nspeed rail of USD 300bn and the USA\u2019s\njoint strike fighter (USD 400bn). This\nlarge scale means that it is crucial for\nthe money spent on projects to be better\nmanaged.\nThe impacts of funds of this\nsize being mismanaged can be felt on\na national and even international scale.\nOver the period 2008 to 2017, performance on Government projects\nunder the Capital Works Programme\nhas generally been to a good standard, particularly from a budget perspective. Although certain projects\nrequired additional funding owing\nto project specific circumstances, the\nmajority of approved projects were\ndelivered at or under the original\nApproved Project Estimates (APE).\nAdditional funding was required in approximately 10% of the\nprojects and the amount represented\nsome 8% of the total provision of\nthese projects.\nAlso of importance, this period of time was particularly active\nfor the Industry, with approximately\n850 Category A projects having their\nfinal accounts settled. In terms of\ncost, the original APE of these projects totalled approximately HKD\n240bn as compared with cumulative final accounts of approximately\nHKD 210bn \u2013 leading to an overall\nsurplus of HKD 30bn.\nEffectively, this means the\nsurplus generated at the portfolio\nlevel was more than able to offset\nthe cost overruns incurred by a select\nnumber of projects.\nTo reinforce the positive nature of this performance, Professor\nBent Flyvbjerg of the University of\nOxford pointed out that Hong Kong\nis better than many other regions\nwhen it comes to project cost estimation, based on his findings in a study\ncovering over 100 international jurisdictions.\nMegaprojects are those that\ncome with high levels of procurement, design and/or construction\ncomplexity as well as scale. They\ntypically take multiple years to implement and often involve high levels\nof risk to the participants involved.\nUnfortunately, a number of complex\nmegaprojects in Hong Kong have\nsuffered from underperformance in\nthe form of delays, cost overruns\nand/or quality failures in recent\nyears. These incidents have been\nwell documented through extensive\nmedia coverage \u2013 leading to reduced\nlevels of public confidence in the in\u0002dustry.\nThe early stages of a project\nare crucial and can set the tone and\ninfluence its efficacy. One of the\nchallenges of project performance\nis the sensitivity to timescales in taking corrective action. The later such\nactions are undertaken, the harder\nand more resource intensive it is to\nrectify problems.\nHowever, it is not always\neasy to identify risky projects before\nthings have gone wrong and they re\u0002quire substantial and costly remedy.\nThe Construction Industry Council\nestimates that construction expenditure will increase in real terms by up\nto 42% to HKD 325bn, compared\nto 2021. The Development Bureau\nof the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has launched their\nvision for Construction 2.0 to support effective delivery.\nA key policy objective of the\nDevelopment Bureau is \u2018to ensure\nthe effective planning, management\nand implementation of public sector infrastructure development and\nworks programmes in a safe, timely\nand cost-effective manner and to\nmaintain high quality and standards.\u2019\nIn order to do this, it is vital\nfor senior managers to notice problems and ensure efficient, effective\nand timely intervention when necessary. However, senior managers lack\nthe daily and deep involvement in\ntheir projects. They need the right\nmonitoring tools and early-warning\n-sign systems to help them in their\nproject supervision.\n\n\nTHE EXISTING SYSTEM\nEARLY WARNINGS\nA WEB-BASED MONITORING SYSTEM BASED\nON CASHFLOWS OF HISTORIC PROJECTS\nThe Development Bureau\nuses the PSS, or Project Supervision\nSystem, to monitor capital works\nprojects and provide early-warning\nsignals to senior management. The\nPSS is a web-based application comprising a series of standardized project cashflow graphs.\nThe graphs are based on the\npast cashflows of capital works projects. The PSS covers different categories for building and non-building\nprojects with various construction\ndurations.\nAll active projects submit\ntheir actual cashflows to date and\ntheir planned cashflows for the remainder of the project. The PSS uses\nthis information to identify any unusual patterns.\nThere are 3 types of patterns\nwhich then trigger different followup actions.\nFirst, normal performance.\nThe project cashflow falls within the\ngreen zone. There is no follow-up\naction for projects with normal performance. The data of these projects\nwill be stored for future use and refinement of the system.\nSecond, yellow performance\nraises an alert. The project cashflow\nfalls within the yellow zone, meaning\nheads of departments need to review\nthese projects. The review takes in the\nrisk of cost overrun and programme\ndelay. The heads of departments are\nresponsible for the project assessment\nand, if necessary, for the planning\nand implementation of appropriate\nrecovery measures.\nThird, red performance flags\nthe strongest warning. When the\nproject cashflow falls within the red\nzone, the Permanent Secretary for\nDevelopment (Works) chairs a top\nmanagement meeting, which monitors all projects in this category.\n\nThe monitoring system\nprovides a better understanding of\nvarious elements of a project\u2019s performance. Here are some insightful\nexamples from the first year of using\nthe system.\nThe first project falls into the\nlower yellow zone, which indicates\nslow progress. The question to investigate is whether the project might\nbe able to take actions to catch up\n(purple dotted line), or will be delayed (blue dotted line).\nThe second project falls\ninto the upper yellow zone, which\nindicates fast progress or cost overrun. The team needs to investigate\nwhether the project is indeed making very good progress and will be\ncompleted early (purple dotted line),\nor if the project will experience cost\noverrun (blue dotted line). In either\ncase project plans and budgets might\nneed to be adjusted as a result of the\ninvestigation.\nThe third project falls into\nthe lower red zone and has stayed\npersistently in this zone for more\nthan a year.\nThis can signal a very long\ndelay or an overinflated budget due\nto excessive contingency. In this case,\nthe team investigated the project indepth and found that the project carried too much contingency.\nThe project team reviewed\nthe cost and developed a more realistic project budget. Once the cashflow\nwas adjusted according to the new\nbudget, the cashflow fell back into\nthe normal zone.\n\n\n\nAfter using our monitoring system for over a year, we discovered\nthat instead of it being a mere monitoring tool, the system\nprovides a benchmark and even means to set better target for the\nproject teams\u2019 delivery of their projects. The data of these\nprojects, once completed, will form part of the database\ncreating a self-learning and self-updating system. Hong Kong\u2019s\nproject governance will be enhanced by the positive and\ninteractive feedback between the PSS and the ongoing projects.\n\n\n\nTHE DATA\nThese closed projects have a total outturn cost of HKD 460bn (in\n2019 HKD terms) and individual projects range from HKD 10m to 13bn.\nThe mean project value is HKD 550m.\nThe project durations range from 10 months to 18 years, with an\naverage 3-year duration. In total, the portfolio contains more than 2,700\nyears of construction activity.\nThe average project costs 15% less than forecast, and the range of\ncost outcomes is from 69% below the budget to 59% over budget. There\u2019s\na far greater range in project duration, ranging from 41% shorter than\nplanned to 317% longer than planned. The average delay is 34% for the\ndelayed projects.\nThe historic 2008-17 dataset is representative of current perfor\u0002mance, according to the Development Bureau\u2019s response to the Legislative\nCouncil for projects in 2018-19.\n\n\n\nFIRST FINDING OF THE AI\nPROJECT TYPES\nAI ALGORITHM IDENTIFIED THE GROUPINGS OF PROJECTS THAT\nHAVE A DISTINCTIVE CASHFLOW PATTERN\nTo analyse the cashflow data,\ntwo methods were selected: tracking\nannual performance as a percentage\nof the (1) outturn performance and\n(2) the original plan.\nA relative timeline was de\u0002termined for each project, with the\npercentage of the total duration as\u0002signed to each year. For instance, in a\nfour-year project the first year would\nhave 25% progress, the second 50%\netc.\nThe data for the analysis\ncomprised completed projects con\u0002taining actual outcomes, but the\nforecasted outcomes will be used\nin the future, so the dual reporting\nwill reflect cost and schedule perfor\u0002mance as a percentage of the most\nrecent forecast and the original plan.\nThe analysis used random\nforrests, an artificial intelligence\nmethod to analyse the data. This un\u0002supervised learning algorithm con\u0002sidered all possible characteristics to\ngroup the projects then extracted the\ntypical cashflows from the s-curves\nand compared the fit of the curves.\nAnalysis of the PSS identi\u0002fied that four types of projects had\nstatistically significantly different\noutcomes. The analysis resulted in\na decision tree, where the first deci\u0002sion divides all projects along the\nlines of building or non-building\nprojects. Then the building projects\nare categorised by whether the origi\u0002nal budget was smaller than HKD\n150m or not and the non-building\nprojects were categorised by whether\nthe planned duration was less than\nsix years or not.\n\n\nRESULTS FROM THE AI\nW A R N I N G\nFLAGS\nEach project was assigned a\nwarning flag status; red, amber or\ngreen based on the outcome of the\nproject. If the project finished in the\nmiddle 40% of the historic projects\n(30th\u201370th percentile) the project\ngot a green flag. The bottom and\ntop 5% of the project got a red flag\n(<5th or >95th percentile). All other\nprojects got an amber warning flag\n(5th\u201330th and 70th\u201395th percen\u0002tile).\nAfter assigning the warning\nflag based on the project outcomes\nwe trained three AI algorithms\n(gradient booster, neural network, rolling discretizer) to find out the\nwarning flag status based on progress\nand cashflows.\nThe first AI assigns a warning flag for cost performance. The\nalgorithm looks at progress and then\nthe share of dispensed cash to date\nThe second AI assigns a\nwarning flag for schedule perfor\u0002mance. The algorithm looks at the\nshare of dispensed cash and then at\nthe progress made\nThe rolling discretizer, an algorithm specifically created for this task, achieved the most accurate\npredictions in unseen test data. To\nvalidate the predictive power of the\nalgorithm the data were split into a\ntraining and a test set. The AI learned\nfrom 70% of the data how to assign\nwarning flags. Then the accuracy\nof the warning flags was measured\non the remaining 30% of the data,\nwhich the algorithm had not seen\nbefore.\nThe AI achieves an excellent\nperformance, especially in identify\u0002ing the red projects correctly. The\nperformance is well balanced across\nthe different flags.\n53%\u201369% of all the flags\nassigned to the observations are ac\u0002curate. This means, for example, that\nif the AI assigns a red flag for a cost\noverrun the algorithm is accurate\nnearly 7 out of 10 times.\nThe accuracy of the schedule\nflags is slightly worse. Here the AI is\naccurate in its prediction 18%\u201363%\nof the time.\nThe AI outperforms the split\nby project type, which was only ac\u0002curate in 8%\u201340% of predictions.\nThe AI vastly outperforms\nrandomness. If we simply made an\nuninformed \u201clucky\u201d guess about the\nproject\u2019s risk we would get it right in\n3%\u201325% of times.\nEspecially for the very high\nrisk category \u201cred\u201d the AI is more\nthan 20\u2013times better than a lucky\nguess.\nIn addition to the valida\u0002tion with a test and training set of\nthe data, we tested how little data\nthe AI needs to achieve this level of\naccuracy. The analysis shows that is\npossible with as little as 10% of the\ndata. We were surprised by this find\u0002ing, because we always assumed that\nAI needs lots of data. It turns out we\nwere wrong. Any organisation wish\u0002ing to integrate AI into their early\n-warning-sign system needs some but\nnot vast amounts of data.\nThe AI is far from perfect;\nthe accuracy is surpsingly good even\nthough the algorithm only knew the\ncashflow and type of a project.\nAdding more data in the fu\u0002ture will certainly improve the ac\u0002curacy\n\n\n\nL O O K I N G F O R W A R D\nWITH THE AI\nP R E D I C T I N G\nCOST\nThe accuracy of the warning flag AI is promising enough to train\nmore algorithms on an even more detailed task: forecast the\noutturn cost of projects. A more complex AI, a deep artificial\nneural network, predicted the final outturn cost with an average\nerror of only \u00b18%. The accuracy is as good as a Class 1 estimate.\nThe next challenge we set for\nthe AI algorithms was to predict the\nfinal outturn cost of projects.\nThe AI only knew the per\u0002centage of progress the project had\nachieved so far, measured against the\nplanned project duration at final in\u0002vestment decision and the cashflow\nspent to date as percentage of the\nbudget, that was approved at the fi\u0002nal investment decision.\nFor this challenge we tested\nmany different AI and non-AI algo\u0002rithms, including linear regressions,\nsupport vector machines, gradient\nboosters, random forrest regressions,\nk-nearest neighbours, multilayer\npercepetrons, simple deep neural\nnetworks and complex deep neural\nnetworks.\nWe measured the error of the\npredicted outturn cost in the train\u0002ing data, which tells us how good\nthe AI is at summarising the data it\nknows. We then gave the AI unseen\ndata to test the prediction. As before,\nthe AI used 70% of the data to train\nand 30% for testing.\nThe best performing algo\u0002rithm was the simple deep neural\nnetwork. The mean squared error\nof the predictions for the test data\nwas 1.6 percentage points. The mean\nabsolute error in the test data was 7.9\npercentage points.\nThis means that on aver\u0002age the forecasted outturn cost was\nwithin \u00b18% at the portfolio level.\nThe mean squared error, which is\nsimilar to the standard deviation, is\nonly \u00b11.6%, thus 68% of predictions\nare within a range of \u00b11.6%, 95%\nof predictions are within a range\nof \u00b13.2% and 99.7% of predictions\nare within \u00b14.8% of the predicted\ncost. The mean absolute error of the\nprediction is \u00b17.9%, therefore an\nindication of the skew in the data,\nwhere very large overruns and fat\ntails are not uncommon.\nThe AI estimate is in line\nwith what conventional cost esti\u0002mation practice considers to be the\nbest cost estimate achievable. The\nAssociation for the Advancement of\nCost Engineering (AACE) suggests\nthat international best practice for\na best-in-class cost estimate has an\nerror between \u00b13% and \u00b115%; to\nachieve an estimate with this narrow\nerror range, 100% of design needs to\nbe completed and detailed informa\u0002tion of unit cost and prices needs to\nbe available. The estimate of the AI\nfalls within the range expected for a\nClass 1 cost estimate.\n\n\n\n\nCASE STUDIES\nSPOTTING RISK\nALL HONG KONG PROJECTS ARE MONITORED BY THE PSS.\nTHESE ARE TWO REAL-LIFE CASES WHERE THE AI SPOTTED RISKY\nPROJECTS EARLY\nWe selected two capital works projects from the portfolio to run the AI analyses. Project 1 has an approved project\ncost estimate (APE) of HKD 5.2bn with completion within 3.5 years. Project 2 has an approved budget of HKD\n1.3bn with a construction duration of 3.9 years. Project 1 has completed its first year of construction. Project 2\nhas completed its first two years of construction.\nThe latest cashflow information shows that project 1 has spent 1% of its cash and is nearly 29% complete when\nmeasured against the originally planned duration. Project 2 is 51% complete and has spent 21% of its cash.\nFirst, the AI assigned warning flags. Project 1 has a red flag. Project 1 has been spending the budget slower than\nthe AI anticipates based on the typical spending pattern of capital works projects in Hong Kong. The project\u2019s own\nforecast of spend (dotted line) shows\nthat this trend will reverse in the next\ntwo years and exceed usual patterns\nin years 4 and 5. The AI\u2019s flag raises\nquestions about this unusual profile\nof acceleration and suggests further\ninvestigation.\nProject 2 receives a yellow flag. The\nproject is spending its budget more\nslowly than typical projects but it\nforecasts that it will soon be in line\nwith others. The schedule flags show a similar pattern. Project 1 gets a red\nflag for being very late if it can keep\nup the expenditure as is (under the\nassumption that this is not indicating\na big cost underrun).\nProject 2 is progressing like a typical\nproject in Hong Kong and the AI as\u0002signed a green schedule flag. But the\nAI raises questions about the plans\nafter year 5.\nThe AI also produces a cost forecast\nof the final outturn cost. At the mo- ment Project 1 is forecasted to cost\nHKD 4.0bn. For this estimate, the\nAI assumes that the project will not\nfollow its own forecasted trajectory\nbut behave more like a typical project\nin the future. However, the unusual\npattern of expenditure means that if\nthe project does indeed accelerate its\nspend the cost are likely HKD 5.1bn\nclose to the APE. Project 2 has similar issues. The AI forecasts outturn\ncost of HKD 1.0bn. The project\u2019s\nown forecasts show a spike in spending near the end; if that holds true\nthe AI forecasts spending of HKD\n1.3bn. Again the readiness for acceleration should be investigated.\n\n\nThe enhancement of the PSS does not stop here. Our future plans\ninclude adding more detailed project data, further developing\nthe AI to enhance the predictive power and extending the PSS to\nrailway projects in collaboration with other international regions. Our innovations will not only support Hong Kong\u2019s ambi\u0002tious vision but also benefit projects worldwide."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Slide 1: Title Slide\n- Project Title: \"AI in Action: How the Hong Kong Development Bureau Built the PSS \u2014 An Early-Warning Sign System for Public Works Projects\"\n\nSlide 2: Introduction\n- Brief project overview\n- Team members and their respective contributions\n\nSlide 3: Brainstorming Techniques\n- Explain the importance of brainstorming in developing creative solutions\n- Describe different brainstorming techniques used in the project\n\nSlide 4: Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions\n- Introduce Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions Theory\n- Analyze cultural differences and challenges in the Hong Kong construction industry and project management\n- Explain their impact on the project\n\nSlide 5: Challenges\n- Present the challenges faced by Hong Kong\u2019s construction industry\n- Discuss the increasing project costs and risks in megaprojects\n\nSlide 6: Existing System (PSS)\n- Describe the Project Supervision System (PSS) and its role in monitoring capital works projects\n- Explain how it raises different levels of warning flags and follow-up actions\n\nSlide 7: AI in PSS\n- Introduce the idea of incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the PSS\n- Describe the benefits of using AI for early-warning signs and project monitoring\n\nSlide 8: AI Algorithm and Data Analysis\n- Outline the AI algorithms used and the data analysis process\n- Explain how AI helps in predicting project outcomes and identifying risky projects\n\nSlide 9: AI Results and Accuracy\n- Present the accuracy of the AI's predictions for warning flags and outturn costs\n- Explain the performance and potential improvement of the AI\n\nSlide 10: Case Studies\n- Describe two real-life case studies where the AI spotted risky projects early\n- Explain the AI's role in predicting the outcomes and raising warning flags for these projects\n\nSlide 11: Future Enhancements\n- Discuss plans for adding more detailed project data and improving the AI's predictive power\n- Explain the potential benefits of extending the PSS to railway projects and other international regions\n\nSlide 12: Conclusion\n- Summarize the value of incorporating AI in the PSS\n- Emphasize the potential benefits to the Hong Kong construction industry and the global project management field\n\nSlide 13: Questions and Answers\n- Open for questions from the audience and provide answers"}, {"role": "user", "content": "As comprehensively as possible, give me the details of everything in slide 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Slide 2: Introduction\n\n- Brief project overview: This project involves the Hong Kong Development Bureau's implementation of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based Early-Warning Sign System called the Project Supervision System (PSS).

Mind Mapping: A visual technique that involves structuring information in the form of branches stemming from a central topic or idea, helping organize and connect various aspects of the project.\n  2. Round-Robin Brainstorming: Team members take turns sharing their ideas in an orderly and time-bound manner, ensuring equal participation from everyone and avoiding dominance by a few voices.\n  3. Brainwriting: Each team member independently writes down their ideas before pooling and discussing them together as a group, allowing for a higher volume and variety of ideas to be generated and fostering individual creativity.\n  4. SWOT Analysis: A strategic tool used to examine the project's internal strengths and weaknesses along with external opportunities and threats, guiding the identification of areas for improvement and growth.\n\nIn this slide, the focus is on explaining the significance of brainstorming in generating creative solutions for effective project management.

However, ten per cent of local projects over-run\ntheir budgets, with a total overspend of eight percent.\nSome flagship projects have over-run their budgets and\ncompletion dates, causing public embarrassment.\nIt is crucial to get these cost and schedule estimates under\ncontrol in order that the booming infrastructure environ\u0002ment in Hong Kong can flourish to its potential while\ncarefully monitoring costs and performance.\nWe investigated whether Artificial Intelligence (AI) can play\na part in accurately predicting these outcomes and identify\u0002ing ahead of time when a project is going off track, allowing\nearly intervention.\nThe large volume of projects in Hong Kong needs to be mon\u0002itored collectively, with a system that allows leaders to focus\ntheir efforts on the projects most likely to fail. An automated\nsystem simplifies this process, and in our studies was found\nto be as accurate as the best-in-class human cost estimates.\nHigh quality data is available in Hong Kong, and we stud\u0002ied a total of 2,700 years of combined construction activity\nand HKD 450bn in construction spent to trial this innova\u0002tive project management approach. We unexpectedly discov\u0002ered, however, that the AI needs only a very small amount\nof data in order to make good predictions.\nWE BELIEVE THESE EARLY FINDINGS WILL\nINFORM A NEW APPROACH TO PROJECT PERFOR\u0002MANCE MONITORING AND LEAD THE WAY IN\nCAPITAL WORKS PROJECTS INTERNATIONALLY\n\n\n\nTHE CHALLENGE\nHong Kong expects project spending to increase by 42% between\n2021 and 2031. The expected annual expenditure will reach up to\nHKD 325bn by 2031.\nHowever, these projects are not without their problems.\nTo spot challenges early, the Project Strategy and Governance\nOffice established a system to support supervision and govern\u0002ance of projects by providing early-warning signals to senior\nleaders of projects that are at risk.\nProjects are used to deliver the\nmost significant initiatives in the world;\nfrom the Olympics, the artificial island\nof Lantau, to the International Space\nStation.\nOne of the challenges currently\nfaced by project leaders and investors is\nthat projects do not perform well.\nThey underperform in terms\nof execution, with significant cost and\nschedule overruns. 50% delays are com\u0002mon.\nOur research has shown this\nwoeful underperformance is so con\u0002sistent that we\u2019ve coined the iron law\nof megaprojects: they are \u2018over budget,\nover time, over and over again\u2019.\nThis poor performance is not a\nrecent phenomenon: it has been fairly\nconsistent for over 70 years. It is also\ncommon to different countries, sectors\nand delivery in the private and public\nsectors.\nThe scale of projects has been\nincreasing for decades. The largest\nmegaprojects have budgets that match\nthe gross domestic products of the larg\u0002est countries.\nThe GDP of Hong Kong\nin 2020 was USD 347bn, a similar\namount to the budget for China\u2019s high\nspeed rail of USD 300bn and the USA\u2019s\njoint strike fighter (USD 400bn). This\nlarge scale means that it is crucial for\nthe money spent on projects to be better\nmanaged.\nThe impacts of funds of this\nsize being mismanaged can be felt on\na national and even international scale.\nOver the period 2008 to 2017, performance on Government projects\nunder the Capital Works Programme\nhas generally been to a good standard, particularly from a budget perspective. Although certain projects\nrequired additional funding owing\nto project specific circumstances, the\nmajority of approved projects were\ndelivered at or under the original\nApproved Project Estimates (APE).\nAdditional funding was required in approximately 10% of the\nprojects and the amount represented\nsome 8% of the total provision of\nthese projects.\nAlso of importance, this period of time was particularly active\nfor the Industry, with approximately\n850 Category A projects having their\nfinal accounts settled. In terms of\ncost, the original APE of these projects totalled approximately HKD\n240bn as compared with cumulative final accounts of approximately\nHKD 210bn \u2013 leading to an overall\nsurplus of HKD 30bn.\nEffectively, this means the\nsurplus generated at the portfolio\nlevel was more than able to offset\nthe cost overruns incurred by a select\nnumber of projects.\nTo reinforce the positive nature of this performance, Professor\nBent Flyvbjerg of the University of\nOxford pointed out that Hong Kong\nis better than many other regions\nwhen it comes to project cost estimation, based on his findings in a study\ncovering over 100 international jurisdictions.\nMegaprojects are those that\ncome with high levels of procurement, design and/or construction\ncomplexity as well as scale. They\ntypically take multiple years to implement and often involve high levels\nof risk to the participants involved.\nUnfortunately, a number of complex\nmegaprojects in Hong Kong have\nsuffered from underperformance in\nthe form of delays, cost overruns\nand/or quality failures in recent\nyears. These incidents have been\nwell documented through extensive\nmedia coverage \u2013 leading to reduced\nlevels of public confidence in the in\u0002dustry.\nThe early stages of a project\nare crucial and can set the tone and\ninfluence its efficacy. One of the\nchallenges of project performance\nis the sensitivity to timescales in taking corrective action. The later such\nactions are undertaken, the harder\nand more resource intensive it is to\nrectify problems.\nHowever, it is not always\neasy to identify risky projects before\nthings have gone wrong and they re\u0002quire substantial and costly remedy.\nThe Construction Industry Council\nestimates that construction expenditure will increase in real terms by up\nto 42% to HKD 325bn, compared\nto 2021. The Development Bureau\nof the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has launched their\nvision for Construction 2.0 to support effective delivery.\nA key policy objective of the\nDevelopment Bureau is \u2018to ensure\nthe effective planning, management\nand implementation of public sector infrastructure development and\nworks programmes in a safe, timely\nand cost-effective manner and to\nmaintain high quality and standards.\u2019\nIn order to do this, it is vital\nfor senior managers to notice problems and ensure efficient, effective\nand timely intervention when necessary. However, senior managers lack\nthe daily and deep involvement in\ntheir projects. They need the right\nmonitoring tools and early-warning\n-sign systems to help them in their\nproject supervision.\n\n\nTHE EXISTING SYSTEM\nEARLY WARNINGS\nA WEB-BASED MONITORING SYSTEM BASED\nON CASHFLOWS OF HISTORIC PROJECTS\nThe Development Bureau\nuses the PSS, or Project Supervision\nSystem, to monitor capital works\nprojects and provide early-warning\nsignals to senior management. The\nPSS is a web-based application comprising a series of standardized project cashflow graphs.\nThe graphs are based on the\npast cashflows of capital works projects. The PSS covers different categories for building and non-building\nprojects with various construction\ndurations.\nAll active projects submit\ntheir actual cashflows to date and\ntheir planned cashflows for the remainder of the project. The PSS uses\nthis information to identify any unusual patterns.\nThere are 3 types of patterns\nwhich then trigger different followup actions.\nFirst, normal performance.\nThe project cashflow falls within the\ngreen zone. There is no follow-up\naction for projects with normal performance. The data of these projects\nwill be stored for future use and refinement of the system.\nSecond, yellow performance\nraises an alert. The project cashflow\nfalls within the yellow zone, meaning\nheads of departments need to review\nthese projects. The review takes in the\nrisk of cost overrun and programme\ndelay. The heads of departments are\nresponsible for the project assessment\nand, if necessary, for the planning\nand implementation of appropriate\nrecovery measures.\nThird, red performance flags\nthe strongest warning. When the\nproject cashflow falls within the red\nzone, the Permanent Secretary for\nDevelopment (Works) chairs a top\nmanagement meeting, which monitors all projects in this category.\n\nThe monitoring system\nprovides a better understanding of\nvarious elements of a project\u2019s performance. Here are some insightful\nexamples from the first year of using\nthe system.\nThe first project falls into the\nlower yellow zone, which indicates\nslow progress. The question to investigate is whether the project might\nbe able to take actions to catch up\n(purple dotted line), or will be delayed (blue dotted line).\nThe second project falls\ninto the upper yellow zone, which\nindicates fast progress or cost overrun. The team needs to investigate\nwhether the project is indeed making very good progress and will be\ncompleted early (purple dotted line),\nor if the project will experience cost\noverrun (blue dotted line). In either\ncase project plans and budgets might\nneed to be adjusted as a result of the\ninvestigation.\nThe third project falls into\nthe lower red zone and has stayed\npersistently in this zone for more\nthan a year.\nThis can signal a very long\ndelay or an overinflated budget due\nto excessive contingency. In this case,\nthe team investigated the project indepth and found that the project carried too much contingency.\nThe project team reviewed\nthe cost and developed a more realistic project budget. Once the cashflow\nwas adjusted according to the new\nbudget, the cashflow fell back into\nthe normal zone.\n\n\n\nAfter using our monitoring system for over a year, we discovered\nthat instead of it being a mere monitoring tool, the system\nprovides a benchmark and even means to set better target for the\nproject teams\u2019 delivery of their projects. The data of these\nprojects, once completed, will form part of the database\ncreating a self-learning and self-updating system. Hong Kong\u2019s\nproject governance will be enhanced by the positive and\ninteractive feedback between the PSS and the ongoing projects.\n\n\n\nTHE DATA\nThese closed projects have a total outturn cost of HKD 460bn (in\n2019 HKD terms) and individual projects range from HKD 10m to 13bn.\nThe mean project value is HKD 550m.\nThe project durations range from 10 months to 18 years, with an\naverage 3-year duration. In total, the portfolio contains more than 2,700\nyears of construction activity.\nThe average project costs 15% less than forecast, and the range of\ncost outcomes is from 69% below the budget to 59% over budget. There\u2019s\na far greater range in project duration, ranging from 41% shorter than\nplanned to 317% longer than planned. The average delay is 34% for the\ndelayed projects.\nThe historic 2008-17 dataset is representative of current perfor\u0002mance, according to the Development Bureau\u2019s response to the Legislative\nCouncil for projects in 2018-19.\n\n\n\nFIRST FINDING OF THE AI\nPROJECT TYPES\nAI ALGORITHM IDENTIFIED THE GROUPINGS OF PROJECTS THAT\nHAVE A DISTINCTIVE CASHFLOW PATTERN\nTo analyse the cashflow data,\ntwo methods were selected: tracking\nannual performance as a percentage\nof the (1) outturn performance and\n(2) the original plan.\nA relative timeline was de\u0002termined for each project, with the\npercentage of the total duration as\u0002signed to each year. For instance, in a\nfour-year project the first year would\nhave 25% progress, the second 50%\netc.\nThe data for the analysis\ncomprised completed projects con\u0002taining actual outcomes, but the\nforecasted outcomes will be used\nin the future, so the dual reporting\nwill reflect cost and schedule perfor\u0002mance as a percentage of the most\nrecent forecast and the original plan.\nThe analysis used random\nforrests, an artificial intelligence\nmethod to analyse the data. This un\u0002supervised learning algorithm con\u0002sidered all possible characteristics to\ngroup the projects then extracted the\ntypical cashflows from the s-curves\nand compared the fit of the curves.\nAnalysis of the PSS identi\u0002fied that four types of projects had\nstatistically significantly different\noutcomes. The analysis resulted in\na decision tree, where the first deci\u0002sion divides all projects along the\nlines of building or non-building\nprojects. Then the building projects\nare categorised by whether the origi\u0002nal budget was smaller than HKD\n150m or not and the non-building\nprojects were categorised by whether\nthe planned duration was less than\nsix years or not.\n\n\nRESULTS FROM THE AI\nW A R N I N G\nFLAGS\nEach project was assigned a\nwarning flag status; red, amber or\ngreen based on the outcome of the\nproject. If the project finished in the\nmiddle 40% of the historic projects\n(30th\u201370th percentile) the project\ngot a green flag. The bottom and\ntop 5% of the project got a red flag\n(<5th or >95th percentile). All other\nprojects got an amber warning flag\n(5th\u201330th and 70th\u201395th percen\u0002tile).\nAfter assigning the warning\nflag based on the project outcomes\nwe trained three AI algorithms\n(gradient booster, neural network, rolling discretizer) to find out the\nwarning flag status based on progress\nand cashflows.\nThe first AI assigns a warning flag for cost performance. The\nalgorithm looks at progress and then\nthe share of dispensed cash to date\nThe second AI assigns a\nwarning flag for schedule perfor\u0002mance. The algorithm looks at the\nshare of dispensed cash and then at\nthe progress made\nThe rolling discretizer, an algorithm specifically created for this task, achieved the most accurate\npredictions in unseen test data. To\nvalidate the predictive power of the\nalgorithm the data were split into a\ntraining and a test set. The AI learned\nfrom 70% of the data how to assign\nwarning flags. Then the accuracy\nof the warning flags was measured\non the remaining 30% of the data,\nwhich the algorithm had not seen\nbefore.\nThe AI achieves an excellent\nperformance, especially in identify\u0002ing the red projects correctly. The\nperformance is well balanced across\nthe different flags.\n53%\u201369% of all the flags\nassigned to the observations are ac\u0002curate. This means, for example, that\nif the AI assigns a red flag for a cost\noverrun the algorithm is accurate\nnearly 7 out of 10 times.\nThe accuracy of the schedule\nflags is slightly worse. Here the AI is\naccurate in its prediction 18%\u201363%\nof the time.\nThe AI outperforms the split\nby project type, which was only ac\u0002curate in 8%\u201340% of predictions.\nThe AI vastly outperforms\nrandomness. If we simply made an\nuninformed \u201clucky\u201d guess about the\nproject\u2019s risk we would get it right in\n3%\u201325% of times.\nEspecially for the very high\nrisk category \u201cred\u201d the AI is more\nthan 20\u2013times better than a lucky\nguess.\nIn addition to the valida\u0002tion with a test and training set of\nthe data, we tested how little data\nthe AI needs to achieve this level of\naccuracy. The analysis shows that is\npossible with as little as 10% of the\ndata. We were surprised by this find\u0002ing, because we always assumed that\nAI needs lots of data. It turns out we\nwere wrong. Any organisation wish\u0002ing to integrate AI into their early\n-warning-sign system needs some but\nnot vast amounts of data.\nThe AI is far from perfect;\nthe accuracy is surpsingly good even\nthough the algorithm only knew the\ncashflow and type of a project.\nAdding more data in the fu\u0002ture will certainly improve the ac\u0002curacy\n\n\n\nL O O K I N G F O R W A R D\nWITH THE AI\nP R E D I C T I N G\nCOST\nThe accuracy of the warning flag AI is promising enough to train\nmore algorithms on an even more detailed task: forecast the\noutturn cost of projects. A more complex AI, a deep artificial\nneural network, predicted the final outturn cost with an average\nerror of only \u00b18%. The accuracy is as good as a Class 1 estimate.\nThe next challenge we set for\nthe AI algorithms was to predict the\nfinal outturn cost of projects.\nThe AI only knew the per\u0002centage of progress the project had\nachieved so far, measured against the\nplanned project duration at final in\u0002vestment decision and the cashflow\nspent to date as percentage of the\nbudget, that was approved at the fi\u0002nal investment decision.\nFor this challenge we tested\nmany different AI and non-AI algo\u0002rithms, including linear regressions,\nsupport vector machines, gradient\nboosters, random forrest regressions,\nk-nearest neighbours, multilayer\npercepetrons, simple deep neural\nnetworks and complex deep neural\nnetworks.\nWe measured the error of the\npredicted outturn cost in the train\u0002ing data, which tells us how good\nthe AI is at summarising the data it\nknows. We then gave the AI unseen\ndata to test the prediction. As before,\nthe AI used 70% of the data to train\nand 30% for testing.\nThe best performing algo\u0002rithm was the simple deep neural\nnetwork. The mean squared error\nof the predictions for the test data\nwas 1.6 percentage points. The mean\nabsolute error in the test data was 7.9\npercentage points.\nThis means that on aver\u0002age the forecasted outturn cost was\nwithin \u00b18% at the portfolio level.\nThe mean squared error, which is\nsimilar to the standard deviation, is\nonly \u00b11.6%, thus 68% of predictions\nare within a range of \u00b11.6%, 95%\nof predictions are within a range\nof \u00b13.2% and 99.7% of predictions\nare within \u00b14.8% of the predicted\ncost. The mean absolute error of the\nprediction is \u00b17.9%, therefore an\nindication of the skew in the data,\nwhere very large overruns and fat\ntails are not uncommon.\nThe AI estimate is in line\nwith what conventional cost esti\u0002mation practice considers to be the\nbest cost estimate achievable. The\nAssociation for the Advancement of\nCost Engineering (AACE) suggests\nthat international best practice for\na best-in-class cost estimate has an\nerror between \u00b13% and \u00b115%; to\nachieve an estimate with this narrow\nerror range, 100% of design needs to\nbe completed and detailed informa\u0002tion of unit cost and prices needs to\nbe available. The estimate of the AI\nfalls within the range expected for a\nClass 1 cost estimate.\n\n\n\n\nCASE STUDIES\nSPOTTING RISK\nALL HONG KONG PROJECTS ARE MONITORED BY THE PSS.\nTHESE ARE TWO REAL-LIFE CASES WHERE THE AI SPOTTED RISKY\nPROJECTS EARLY\nWe selected two capital works projects from the portfolio to run the AI analyses. Project 1 has an approved project\ncost estimate (APE) of HKD 5.2bn with completion within 3.5 years. Project 2 has an approved budget of HKD\n1.3bn with a construction duration of 3.9 years. Project 1 has completed its first year of construction. Project 2\nhas completed its first two years of construction.\nThe latest cashflow information shows that project 1 has spent 1% of its cash and is nearly 29% complete when\nmeasured against the originally planned duration. Project 2 is 51% complete and has spent 21% of its cash.\nFirst, the AI assigned warning flags. Project 1 has a red flag. Project 1 has been spending the budget slower than\nthe AI anticipates based on the typical spending pattern of capital works projects in Hong Kong. The project\u2019s own\nforecast of spend (dotted line) shows\nthat this trend will reverse in the next\ntwo years and exceed usual patterns\nin years 4 and 5. The AI\u2019s flag raises\nquestions about this unusual profile\nof acceleration and suggests further\ninvestigation.\nProject 2 receives a yellow flag. The\nproject is spending its budget more\nslowly than typical projects but it\nforecasts that it will soon be in line\nwith others. The schedule flags show a similar pattern. Project 1 gets a red\nflag for being very late if it can keep\nup the expenditure as is (under the\nassumption that this is not indicating\na big cost underrun).\nProject 2 is progressing like a typical\nproject in Hong Kong and the AI as\u0002signed a green schedule flag. But the\nAI raises questions about the plans\nafter year 5.\nThe AI also produces a cost forecast\nof the final outturn cost. At the mo- ment Project 1 is forecasted to cost\nHKD 4.0bn. For this estimate, the\nAI assumes that the project will not\nfollow its own forecasted trajectory\nbut behave more like a typical project\nin the future. However, the unusual\npattern of expenditure means that if\nthe project does indeed accelerate its\nspend the cost are likely HKD 5.1bn\nclose to the APE. Project 2 has similar issues. The AI forecasts outturn\ncost of HKD 1.0bn. The project\u2019s\nown forecasts show a spike in spending near the end; if that holds true\nthe AI forecasts spending of HKD\n1.3bn. Again the readiness for acceleration should be investigated.\n\n\nThe enhancement of the PSS does not stop here. Our future plans\ninclude adding more detailed project data, further developing\nthe AI to enhance the predictive power and extending the PSS to\nrailway projects in collaboration with other international regions. Our innovations will not only support Hong Kong\u2019s ambi\u0002tious vision but also benefit projects worldwide.\n\n\nThe Structure is below\n\nSlide 1: Title Slide\n- Project Title: \u201cAI in Action: How the Hong Kong Development Bureau Built the PSS \u2014 An Early-Warning Sign System for Public Works Projects\u201d\n\nSlide 2: Introduction\n- Brief project overview\n- Team members and their respective contributions\n\nSlide 3: Brainstorming Techniques\n- Explain the importance of brainstorming in developing creative solutions\n- Describe different brainstorming techniques used in the project\n\nSlide 4: Hofstede\u2019s Cultural Dimensions\n- Introduce Hofstede\u2019s Cultural Dimensions Theory\n- Analyze cultural differences and challenges in the Hong Kong construction industry and project management\n- Explain their impact on the project\n\nSlide 5: Challenges\n- Present the challenges faced by Hong Kong\u2019s construction industry\n- Discuss the increasing project costs and risks in megaprojects\n\nSlide 6: Existing System (PSS)\n- Describe the Project Supervision System (PSS) and its role in monitoring capital works projects\n- Explain how it raises different levels of warning flags and follow-up actions\n\nSlide 7: AI in PSS\n- Introduce the idea of incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the PSS\n- Describe the benefits of using AI for early-warning signs and project monitoring\n\nSlide 8: AI Algorithm and Data Analysis\n- Outline the AI algorithms used and the data analysis process\n- Explain how AI helps in predicting project outcomes and identifying risky projects\n\nSlide 9: AI Results and Accuracy\n- Present the accuracy of the AI\u2019s predictions for warning flags and outturn costs\n- Explain the performance and potential improvement of the AI\n\nSlide 10: Case Studies\n- Describe two real-life case studies where the AI spotted risky projects early\n- Explain the AI\u2019s role in predicting the outcomes and raising warning flags for these projects\n\nSlide 11: Future Enhancements\n- Discuss plans for adding more detailed project data and improving the AI\u2019s predictive power\n- Explain the potential benefits of extending the PSS to railway projects and other international regions\n\nSlide 12: Conclusion\n- Summarize the value of incorporating AI in the PSS\n- Emphasize the potential benefits to the Hong Kong construction industry and the global project management field\n\nSlide 13: Questions and Answers\n- Open for questions from the audience and provide answers\nAs comprehensively as possible, give me the details of everything in slide 2\n\n\n\nNow, give me all the info needed for slide 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Slide 4: Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions\n\n- Introduce Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions Theory: Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions Theory is a framework developed by Dutch psychologist Geert Hofstede that identifies six dimensions of national culture. These dimensions help in analyzing and understanding cultural differences and their impact on various aspects of society and business, including project management.\n\n- Analyze cultural differences and challenges in the Hong Kong construction industry and project management: The Hong Kong construction industry involves a mix of cultures, including Chinese, Western, and other Asian influences. This brings challenges in terms of communication, decision-making, and leadership styles. For example, Hong Kong has a high power distance score, meaning there is a considerable gap between the authority and power of managers and their subordinates. This can lead to potential communication barriers and hierarchical decision-making processes that can be less efficient or create conflicts in a multicultural project team.\n\n- Explain the impact of the project: In the AI in Action project, understanding and addressing cultural differences is crucial for the successful implementation of the AI-based early-warning system. It requires effective communication among team members, collaboration with various stakeholders, and adapting management styles to accommodate different cultures. Recognizing and managing these cultural differences positively impacts the project, ensuring a smoother implementation process, better cooperation among team members, and improved overall results."}, {"role": "user", "content": "as detailed as possible, give me all the details needed for slide 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Slide 5: Challenges\n\n- Present the challenges faced by Hong Kong's construction industry: The Hong Kong construction industry faces several challenges that impact project management and overall performance. Some of these challenges include:\n\n  1. Rapid growth: Hong Kong expects a 42% increase in project spending between 2021 and 2031, leading to a high demand for efficient project management.\n\n  2. Cost and schedule overruns: Many construction projects in Hong Kong have experienced delays and cost overruns, which have tarnished the industry's reputation.\n\n  3. Resource and labor constraints: The construction industry struggles with a shortage of skilled labor and resources, making it difficult to meet the growing demand for new projects.\n\n  4. Complex mega-projects: Large-scale, complex mega-projects bring significant risks and challenges for project managers, from increased costs and timeframes to potential quality issues.\n\n  5. Environmental sustainability: As Hong Kong continues to develop, there is a growing need for environmentally sustainable practices in the construction industry.\n\n- Discuss the increasing project costs and risks in megaprojects: Mega-projects are characterized by their high levels of complexity, scale, and risks. There has been a consistent trend of cost overruns, delays, and quality issues in such projects around the world. The reasons behind these issues include, but are not limited to:\n\n  1. Poor project planning and estimation: Mega-projects often face issues with inaccurate cost and schedule estimates, leading to miscalculations in budgets and resources.\n\n  2. Inadequate risk management: Mega-projects involve multiple risks, such as financial, technical, and environmental, that need to be managed effectively. The failure to do so can lead to cost overruns and delays.\n\n  3. Organizational complications: Large projects usually involve multiple stakeholders, contractors, and political interests, which can complicate decision-making and communication processes.\n\n  4. Regulatory barriers: Mega-projects can face numerous regulatory hurdles and bureaucratic inefficiencies, causing delays and increased costs.\n\nWith such high stakes involved in mega-projects, enhancing project management and implementing innovative solutions like the AI-based early-warning system in Hong Kong can significantly improve the industry's performance and risk management."}]}, {"facetValue": "prepare a PowerPoint presentation analyzing and planning a global project, focusing on the challenges and management issues of a system used to monitor and predict outcomes for public works projects in Hong Kong.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "receive detailed information and instructions for creating a PowerPoint presentation on a global project related to the use of AI in managing public works projects in Hong Kong, focusing on brainstorming techniques and cultural differences."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "prepare a PowerPoint presentation analyzing and planning a global project, focusing on the challenges and management issues of a system used to monitor and predict outcomes for public works projects in Hong Kong."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "As a Masters degree student, You Have a project and the brief goes thus:\n\n\nComponent A is a team presentation of 25 minutes (with 5 minutes of questions).\n\nAs a group you will be required to create a PowerPoint presentation which will detail the planning and management issues of a global project.\n\n1.Choose a project you know off or you are interested in provided it is global, whether completed or in progress, and make sure that you are able to gather the information that is necessary for your analysis;\n\n2.There are two sets of slides in Blackboard > Learning Material > week 1.

However, ten per cent of local projects over-run\ntheir budgets, with a total overspend of eight percent.\nSome flagship projects have over-run their budgets and\ncompletion dates, causing public embarrassment.\nIt is crucial to get these cost and schedule estimates under\ncontrol in order that the booming infrastructure environ\u0002ment in Hong Kong can flourish to its potential while\ncarefully monitoring costs and performance.\nWe investigated whether Artificial Intelligence (AI) can play\na part in accurately predicting these outcomes and identify\u0002ing ahead of time when a project is going off track, allowing\nearly intervention.\nThe large volume of projects in Hong Kong needs to be mon\u0002itored collectively, with a system that allows leaders to focus\ntheir efforts on the projects most likely to fail. An automated\nsystem simplifies this process, and in our studies was found\nto be as accurate as the best-in-class human cost estimates.\nHigh quality data is available in Hong Kong, and we stud\u0002ied a total of 2,700 years of combined construction activity\nand HKD 450bn in construction spent to trial this innova\u0002tive project management approach. We unexpectedly discov\u0002ered, however, that the AI needs only a very small amount\nof data in order to make good predictions.\nWE BELIEVE THESE EARLY FINDINGS WILL\nINFORM A NEW APPROACH TO PROJECT PERFOR\u0002MANCE MONITORING AND LEAD THE WAY IN\nCAPITAL WORKS PROJECTS INTERNATIONALLY\n\n\n\nTHE CHALLENGE\nHong Kong expects project spending to increase by 42% between\n2021 and 2031. The expected annual expenditure will reach up to\nHKD 325bn by 2031.\nHowever, these projects are not without their problems.\nTo spot challenges early, the Project Strategy and Governance\nOffice established a system to support supervision and govern\u0002ance of projects by providing early-warning signals to senior\nleaders of projects that are at risk.\nProjects are used to deliver the\nmost significant initiatives in the world;\nfrom the Olympics, the artificial island\nof Lantau, to the International Space\nStation.\nOne of the challenges currently\nfaced by project leaders and investors is\nthat projects do not perform well.\nThey underperform in terms\nof execution, with significant cost and\nschedule overruns. 50% delays are com\u0002mon.\nOur research has shown this\nwoeful underperformance is so con\u0002sistent that we\u2019ve coined the iron law\nof megaprojects: they are \u2018over budget,\nover time, over and over again\u2019.\nThis poor performance is not a\nrecent phenomenon: it has been fairly\nconsistent for over 70 years. It is also\ncommon to different countries, sectors\nand delivery in the private and public\nsectors.\nThe scale of projects has been\nincreasing for decades. The largest\nmegaprojects have budgets that match\nthe gross domestic products of the larg\u0002est countries.\nThe GDP of Hong Kong\nin 2020 was USD 347bn, a similar\namount to the budget for China\u2019s high\nspeed rail of USD 300bn and the USA\u2019s\njoint strike fighter (USD 400bn). This\nlarge scale means that it is crucial for\nthe money spent on projects to be better\nmanaged.\nThe impacts of funds of this\nsize being mismanaged can be felt on\na national and even international scale.\nOver the period 2008 to 2017, performance on Government projects\nunder the Capital Works Programme\nhas generally been to a good standard, particularly from a budget perspective. Although certain projects\nrequired additional funding owing\nto project specific circumstances, the\nmajority of approved projects were\ndelivered at or under the original\nApproved Project Estimates (APE).\nAdditional funding was required in approximately 10% of the\nprojects and the amount represented\nsome 8% of the total provision of\nthese projects.\nAlso of importance, this period of time was particularly active\nfor the Industry, with approximately\n850 Category A projects having their\nfinal accounts settled. In terms of\ncost, the original APE of these projects totalled approximately HKD\n240bn as compared with cumulative final accounts of approximately\nHKD 210bn \u2013 leading to an overall\nsurplus of HKD 30bn.\nEffectively, this means the\nsurplus generated at the portfolio\nlevel was more than able to offset\nthe cost overruns incurred by a select\nnumber of projects.\nTo reinforce the positive nature of this performance, Professor\nBent Flyvbjerg of the University of\nOxford pointed out that Hong Kong\nis better than many other regions\nwhen it comes to project cost estimation, based on his findings in a study\ncovering over 100 international jurisdictions.\nMegaprojects are those that\ncome with high levels of procurement, design and/or construction\ncomplexity as well as scale. They\ntypically take multiple years to implement and often involve high levels\nof risk to the participants involved.\nUnfortunately, a number of complex\nmegaprojects in Hong Kong have\nsuffered from underperformance in\nthe form of delays, cost overruns\nand/or quality failures in recent\nyears. These incidents have been\nwell documented through extensive\nmedia coverage \u2013 leading to reduced\nlevels of public confidence in the in\u0002dustry.\nThe early stages of a project\nare crucial and can set the tone and\ninfluence its efficacy. One of the\nchallenges of project performance\nis the sensitivity to timescales in taking corrective action. The later such\nactions are undertaken, the harder\nand more resource intensive it is to\nrectify problems.\nHowever, it is not always\neasy to identify risky projects before\nthings have gone wrong and they re\u0002quire substantial and costly remedy.\nThe Construction Industry Council\nestimates that construction expenditure will increase in real terms by up\nto 42% to HKD 325bn, compared\nto 2021. The Development Bureau\nof the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has launched their\nvision for Construction 2.0 to support effective delivery.\nA key policy objective of the\nDevelopment Bureau is \u2018to ensure\nthe effective planning, management\nand implementation of public sector infrastructure development and\nworks programmes in a safe, timely\nand cost-effective manner and to\nmaintain high quality and standards.\u2019\nIn order to do this, it is vital\nfor senior managers to notice problems and ensure efficient, effective\nand timely intervention when necessary. However, senior managers lack\nthe daily and deep involvement in\ntheir projects. They need the right\nmonitoring tools and early-warning\n-sign systems to help them in their\nproject supervision.\n\n\nTHE EXISTING SYSTEM\nEARLY WARNINGS\nA WEB-BASED MONITORING SYSTEM BASED\nON CASHFLOWS OF HISTORIC PROJECTS\nThe Development Bureau\nuses the PSS, or Project Supervision\nSystem, to monitor capital works\nprojects and provide early-warning\nsignals to senior management. The\nPSS is a web-based application comprising a series of standardized project cashflow graphs.\nThe graphs are based on the\npast cashflows of capital works projects. The PSS covers different categories for building and non-building\nprojects with various construction\ndurations.\nAll active projects submit\ntheir actual cashflows to date and\ntheir planned cashflows for the remainder of the project. The PSS uses\nthis information to identify any unusual patterns.\nThere are 3 types of patterns\nwhich then trigger different followup actions.\nFirst, normal performance.\nThe project cashflow falls within the\ngreen zone. There is no follow-up\naction for projects with normal performance. The data of these projects\nwill be stored for future use and refinement of the system.\nSecond, yellow performance\nraises an alert. The project cashflow\nfalls within the yellow zone, meaning\nheads of departments need to review\nthese projects. The review takes in the\nrisk of cost overrun and programme\ndelay. The heads of departments are\nresponsible for the project assessment\nand, if necessary, for the planning\nand implementation of appropriate\nrecovery measures.\nThird, red performance flags\nthe strongest warning. When the\nproject cashflow falls within the red\nzone, the Permanent Secretary for\nDevelopment (Works) chairs a top\nmanagement meeting, which monitors all projects in this category.\n\nThe monitoring system\nprovides a better understanding of\nvarious elements of a project\u2019s performance. Here are some insightful\nexamples from the first year of using\nthe system.\nThe first project falls into the\nlower yellow zone, which indicates\nslow progress. The question to investigate is whether the project might\nbe able to take actions to catch up\n(purple dotted line), or will be delayed (blue dotted line).\nThe second project falls\ninto the upper yellow zone, which\nindicates fast progress or cost overrun. The team needs to investigate\nwhether the project is indeed making very good progress and will be\ncompleted early (purple dotted line),\nor if the project will experience cost\noverrun (blue dotted line). In either\ncase project plans and budgets might\nneed to be adjusted as a result of the\ninvestigation.\nThe third project falls into\nthe lower red zone and has stayed\npersistently in this zone for more\nthan a year.\nThis can signal a very long\ndelay or an overinflated budget due\nto excessive contingency. In this case,\nthe team investigated the project indepth and found that the project carried too much contingency.\nThe project team reviewed\nthe cost and developed a more realistic project budget. Once the cashflow\nwas adjusted according to the new\nbudget, the cashflow fell back into\nthe normal zone.\n\n\n\nAfter using our monitoring system for over a year, we discovered\nthat instead of it being a mere monitoring tool, the system\nprovides a benchmark and even means to set better target for the\nproject teams\u2019 delivery of their projects. The data of these\nprojects, once completed, will form part of the database\ncreating a self-learning and self-updating system. Hong Kong\u2019s\nproject governance will be enhanced by the positive and\ninteractive feedback between the PSS and the ongoing projects.\n\n\n\nTHE DATA\nThese closed projects have a total outturn cost of HKD 460bn (in\n2019 HKD terms) and individual projects range from HKD 10m to 13bn.\nThe mean project value is HKD 550m.\nThe project durations range from 10 months to 18 years, with an\naverage 3-year duration. In total, the portfolio contains more than 2,700\nyears of construction activity.\nThe average project costs 15% less than forecast, and the range of\ncost outcomes is from 69% below the budget to 59% over budget. There\u2019s\na far greater range in project duration, ranging from 41% shorter than\nplanned to 317% longer than planned. The average delay is 34% for the\ndelayed projects.\nThe historic 2008-17 dataset is representative of current perfor\u0002mance, according to the Development Bureau\u2019s response to the Legislative\nCouncil for projects in 2018-19.\n\n\n\nFIRST FINDING OF THE AI\nPROJECT TYPES\nAI ALGORITHM IDENTIFIED THE GROUPINGS OF PROJECTS THAT\nHAVE A DISTINCTIVE CASHFLOW PATTERN\nTo analyse the cashflow data,\ntwo methods were selected: tracking\nannual performance as a percentage\nof the (1) outturn performance and\n(2) the original plan.\nA relative timeline was de\u0002termined for each project, with the\npercentage of the total duration as\u0002signed to each year. For instance, in a\nfour-year project the first year would\nhave 25% progress, the second 50%\netc.\nThe data for the analysis\ncomprised completed projects con\u0002taining actual outcomes, but the\nforecasted outcomes will be used\nin the future, so the dual reporting\nwill reflect cost and schedule perfor\u0002mance as a percentage of the most\nrecent forecast and the original plan.\nThe analysis used random\nforrests, an artificial intelligence\nmethod to analyse the data. This un\u0002supervised learning algorithm con\u0002sidered all possible characteristics to\ngroup the projects then extracted the\ntypical cashflows from the s-curves\nand compared the fit of the curves.\nAnalysis of the PSS identi\u0002fied that four types of projects had\nstatistically significantly different\noutcomes. The analysis resulted in\na decision tree, where the first deci\u0002sion divides all projects along the\nlines of building or non-building\nprojects. Then the building projects\nare categorised by whether the origi\u0002nal budget was smaller than HKD\n150m or not and the non-building\nprojects were categorised by whether\nthe planned duration was less than\nsix years or not.\n\n\nRESULTS FROM THE AI WARNING FLAGS\nEach project was assigned a warning flag status; red, amber or green based on the outcome of the project. If the project finished in the middle 40% of the historic projects (30th\u201370th percentile) the project got a green flag. The bottom and top 5% of the project got a red flag (<5th or >95th percentile). All other projects got an amber warning flag (5th\u201330th and 70th\u201395th percen\u0002tile). After assigning the warning\nflag based on the project outcomes we trained three AI algorithms (gradient booster, neural network, rolling discretizer) to find out the warning flag status based on progress and cashflows. The first AI assigns a warning flag for cost performance. The algorithm looks at progress and then the share of dispensed cash to date. The second AI assigns a\nwarning flag for schedule perfor\u0002mance. The algorithm looks at the\nshare of dispensed cash and then at\nthe progress made\nThe rolling discretizer, an algorithm specifically created for this task, achieved the most accurate\npredictions in unseen test data. To\nvalidate the predictive power of the\nalgorithm the data were split into a\ntraining and a test set. The AI learned\nfrom 70% of the data how to assign\nwarning flags. Then the accuracy\nof the warning flags was measured\non the remaining 30% of the data,\nwhich the algorithm had not seen\nbefore.\nThe AI achieves an excellent\nperformance, especially in identify\u0002ing the red projects correctly. The\nperformance is well balanced across\nthe different flags.\n53%\u201369% of all the flags\nassigned to the observations are ac\u0002curate. This means, for example, that\nif the AI assigns a red flag for a cost\noverrun the algorithm is accurate\nnearly 7 out of 10 times.\nThe accuracy of the schedule\nflags is slightly worse. Here the AI is\naccurate in its prediction 18%\u201363%\nof the time.\nThe AI outperforms the split\nby project type, which was only ac\u0002curate in 8%\u201340% of predictions.\nThe AI vastly outperforms\nrandomness. If we simply made an\nuninformed \u201clucky\u201d guess about the\nproject\u2019s risk we would get it right in\n3%\u201325% of times.\nEspecially for the very high\nrisk category \u201cred\u201d the AI is more\nthan 20\u2013times better than a lucky\nguess.\nIn addition to the valida\u0002tion with a test and training set of\nthe data, we tested how little data\nthe AI needs to achieve this level of\naccuracy. The analysis shows that is\npossible with as little as 10% of the\ndata. We were surprised by this find\u0002ing, because we always assumed that\nAI needs lots of data. It turns out we\nwere wrong. Any organisation wish\u0002ing to integrate AI into their early\n-warning-sign system needs some but\nnot vast amounts of data.\nThe AI is far from perfect;\nthe accuracy is surpsingly good even\nthough the algorithm only knew the\ncashflow and type of a project.\nAdding more data in the fu\u0002ture will certainly improve the ac\u0002curacy\n\n\n\nL O O K I N G F O R W A R D\nWITH THE AI\nP R E D I C T I N G\nCOST\nThe accuracy of the warning flag AI is promising enough to train\nmore algorithms on an even more detailed task: forecast the\noutturn cost of projects. A more complex AI, a deep artificial\nneural network, predicted the final outturn cost with an average\nerror of only \u00b18%. The accuracy is as good as a Class 1 estimate.\nThe next challenge we set for\nthe AI algorithms was to predict the\nfinal outturn cost of projects.\nThe AI only knew the per\u0002centage of progress the project had\nachieved so far, measured against the\nplanned project duration at final in\u0002vestment decision and the cashflow\nspent to date as percentage of the\nbudget, that was approved at the fi\u0002nal investment decision.\nFor this challenge we tested\nmany different AI and non-AI algo\u0002rithms, including linear regressions,\nsupport vector machines, gradient\nboosters, random forrest regressions,\nk-nearest neighbours, multilayer\npercepetrons, simple deep neural\nnetworks and complex deep neural\nnetworks.\nWe measured the error of the\npredicted outturn cost in the train\u0002ing data, which tells us how good\nthe AI is at summarising the data it\nknows. We then gave the AI unseen\ndata to test the prediction. As before,\nthe AI used 70% of the data to train\nand 30% for testing.\nThe best performing algo\u0002rithm was the simple deep neural\nnetwork. The mean squared error\nof the predictions for the test data\nwas 1.6 percentage points. The mean\nabsolute error in the test data was 7.9\npercentage points.\nThis means that on aver\u0002age the forecasted outturn cost was\nwithin \u00b18% at the portfolio level.\nThe mean squared error, which is\nsimilar to the standard deviation, is\nonly \u00b11.6%, thus 68% of predictions\nare within a range of \u00b11.6%, 95%\nof predictions are within a range\nof \u00b13.2% and 99.7% of predictions\nare within \u00b14.8% of the predicted\ncost. The mean absolute error of the\nprediction is \u00b17.9%, therefore an\nindication of the skew in the data,\nwhere very large overruns and fat\ntails are not uncommon.\nThe AI estimate is in line\nwith what conventional cost esti\u0002mation practice considers to be the\nbest cost estimate achievable. The\nAssociation for the Advancement of\nCost Engineering (AACE) suggests\nthat international best practice for\na best-in-class cost estimate has an\nerror between \u00b13% and \u00b115%; to\nachieve an estimate with this narrow\nerror range, 100% of design needs to\nbe completed and detailed informa\u0002tion of unit cost and prices needs to\nbe available. The estimate of the AI\nfalls within the range expected for a\nClass 1 cost estimate.\n\n\n\n\nCASE STUDIES\nSPOTTING RISK\nALL HONG KONG PROJECTS ARE MONITORED BY THE PSS.\nTHESE ARE TWO REAL-LIFE CASES WHERE THE AI SPOTTED RISKY\nPROJECTS EARLY\nWe selected two capital works projects from the portfolio to run the AI analyses. Project 1 has an approved project\ncost estimate (APE) of HKD 5.2bn with completion within 3.5 years. Project 2 has an approved budget of HKD\n1.3bn with a construction duration of 3.9 years. Project 1 has completed its first year of construction. Project 2\nhas completed its first two years of construction.\nThe latest cashflow information shows that project 1 has spent 1% of its cash and is nearly 29% complete when\nmeasured against the originally planned duration. Project 2 is 51% complete and has spent 21% of its cash.\nFirst, the AI assigned warning flags. Project 1 has a red flag. Project 1 has been spending the budget slower than\nthe AI anticipates based on the typical spending pattern of capital works projects in Hong Kong. The project\u2019s own\nforecast of spend (dotted line) shows\nthat this trend will reverse in the next\ntwo years and exceed usual patterns\nin years 4 and 5. The AI\u2019s flag raises\nquestions about this unusual profile\nof acceleration and suggests further\ninvestigation.\nProject 2 receives a yellow flag. The\nproject is spending its budget more\nslowly than typical projects but it\nforecasts that it will soon be in line\nwith others. The schedule flags show a similar pattern. Project 1 gets a red\nflag for being very late if it can keep\nup the expenditure as is (under the\nassumption that this is not indicating\na big cost underrun).\nProject 2 is progressing like a typical\nproject in Hong Kong and the AI as\u0002signed a green schedule flag. But the\nAI raises questions about the plans\nafter year 5.\nThe AI also produces a cost forecast\nof the final outturn cost. At the mo- ment Project 1 is forecasted to cost\nHKD 4.0bn. For this estimate, the\nAI assumes that the project will not\nfollow its own forecasted trajectory\nbut behave more like a typical project\nin the future. However, the unusual\npattern of expenditure means that if\nthe project does indeed accelerate its\nspend the cost are likely HKD 5.1bn\nclose to the APE. Project 2 has similar issues. The AI forecasts outturn\ncost of HKD 1.0bn. The project\u2019s\nown forecasts show a spike in spending near the end; if that holds true\nthe AI forecasts spending of HKD\n1.3bn. Again the readiness for acceleration should be investigated.\n\n\nThe enhancement of the PSS does not stop here. Our future plans\ninclude adding more detailed project data, further developing\nthe AI to enhance the predictive power and extending the PSS to\nrailway projects in collaboration with other international regions. Our innovations will not only support Hong Kong\u2019s ambi\u0002tious vision but also benefit projects worldwide.\n\n\nThe Structure is below\n\nSlide 1: Title Slide\n\nSlide 2: Introduction\n- Brief project overview\n- Objective of the presentation\n- Outline of presentation sections and team member responsibilities\n\nSlide 3: Project Background\n- Brief description of the chosen global project\n- Problem statement / goal of the project\n- Countries or locations involved\n\nSlide 4: Brainstorming Techniques - Introduction\n- Importance of creative brainstorming in global projects\n- Brief overview of selected brainstorming techniques\n\nSlides 5-9: Brainstorming Techniques \u2013 Details\n- Explanation of each selected brainstorming technique (one technique per slide) with respect to the project.

Brainstorming fosters collaboration among diverse team members, promoting open communication and leveraging the unique perspectives and expertise of individuals from different cultural and professional backgrounds. This can lead to improved decision-making and project outcomes.\n\n- Brief overview of selected brainstorming techniques:\n  1. Storyboarding: This visual technique allows team members to organize and share ideas by creating a sequence of illustrations or images that tell a story or outline a concept.\n  2. Mind Mapping: This technique involves creating a visual representation of ideas and concepts, with a central theme at the center and related ideas branching out. It helps organize thoughts and establish connections between ideas.\n  3. Word Banking: This brainstorming method involves generating a list of words or phrases related to a central theme or problem. Participants can then use these words to spark new ideas and associations.\n  4. Brain Netting: Also known as online brainstorming, this method leverages digital platforms to facilitate idea exchange among remote team members, allowing for inclusion and collaboration across different time zones and locations.\n  5. Reverse Brainstorming: This technique involves identifying potential problems or areas for improvement by asking participants to explore potential negative effects or failures related to the project.\n\nThese brainstorming techniques can be applied collectively or individually, depending on the specific needs and goals of the global project."}]}, {"facetValue": "present an analysis and plan for a global project using a specific framework and tools, including brainstorming techniques and Hofstede's cultural dimensions.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "receive guidance and information for creating a PowerPoint presentation on a global project, focusing on AI in the AI in Action project in Hong Kong, and analyzing cultural dimensions such as uncertainty avoidance and long-term orientation using Hofstede's framework."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "present an analysis and plan for a global project using a specific framework and tools, including brainstorming techniques and Hofstede's cultural dimensions."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "As a Masters degree student, YOu Have a project and the brief goes thus:\n\n\nComponent A is a team presentation of 25 minutes (with 5 minutes of questions).\n\nAs a group you will be required to create a PowerPoint presentation which will detail the planning and management issues of a global project.\n\n1.Choose a project you know off or you are interested in provided it is global, whether completed or in progress, and make sure that you are able to gather the information that is necessary for your analysis;\n\n2.There are two sets of slides in Blackboard > Learning Material > week 1.

However, ten per cent of local projects over-run\ntheir budgets, with a total overspend of eight percent.\nSome flagship projects have over-run their budgets and\ncompletion dates, causing public embarrassment.\nIt is crucial to get these cost and schedule estimates under\ncontrol in order that the booming infrastructure environ\u0002ment in Hong Kong can flourish to its potential while\ncarefully monitoring costs and performance.\nWe investigated whether Artificial Intelligence (AI) can play\na part in accurately predicting these outcomes and identify\u0002ing ahead of time when a project is going off track, allowing\nearly intervention.\nThe large volume of projects in Hong Kong needs to be mon\u0002itored collectively, with a system that allows leaders to focus\ntheir efforts on the projects most likely to fail. An automated\nsystem simplifies this process, and in our studies was found\nto be as accurate as the best-in-class human cost estimates.\nHigh quality data is available in Hong Kong, and we stud\u0002ied a total of 2,700 years of combined construction activity\nand HKD 450bn in construction spent to trial this innova\u0002tive project management approach. We unexpectedly discov\u0002ered, however, that the AI needs only a very small amount\nof data in order to make good predictions.\nWE BELIEVE THESE EARLY FINDINGS WILL\nINFORM A NEW APPROACH TO PROJECT PERFOR\u0002MANCE MONITORING AND LEAD THE WAY IN\nCAPITAL WORKS PROJECTS INTERNATIONALLY\n\n\n\nTHE CHALLENGE\nHong Kong expects project spending to increase by 42% between\n2021 and 2031. The expected annual expenditure will reach up to\nHKD 325bn by 2031.\nHowever, these projects are not without their problems.\nTo spot challenges early, the Project Strategy and Governance\nOffice established a system to support supervision and govern\u0002ance of projects by providing early-warning signals to senior\nleaders of projects that are at risk.\nProjects are used to deliver the\nmost significant initiatives in the world;\nfrom the Olympics, the artificial island\nof Lantau, to the International Space\nStation.\nOne of the challenges currently\nfaced by project leaders and investors is\nthat projects do not perform well.\nThey underperform in terms\nof execution, with significant cost and\nschedule overruns. 50% delays are com\u0002mon.\nOur research has shown this\nwoeful underperformance is so con\u0002sistent that we\u2019ve coined the iron law\nof megaprojects: they are \u2018over budget,\nover time, over and over again\u2019.\nThis poor performance is not a\nrecent phenomenon: it has been fairly\nconsistent for over 70 years. It is also\ncommon to different countries, sectors\nand delivery in the private and public\nsectors.\nThe scale of projects has been\nincreasing for decades. The largest\nmegaprojects have budgets that match\nthe gross domestic products of the larg\u0002est countries.\nThe GDP of Hong Kong\nin 2020 was USD 347bn, a similar\namount to the budget for China\u2019s high\nspeed rail of USD 300bn and the USA\u2019s\njoint strike fighter (USD 400bn). This\nlarge scale means that it is crucial for\nthe money spent on projects to be better\nmanaged.\nThe impacts of funds of this\nsize being mismanaged can be felt on\na national and even international scale.\nOver the period 2008 to 2017, performance on Government projects\nunder the Capital Works Programme\nhas generally been to a good standard, particularly from a budget perspective. Although certain projects\nrequired additional funding owing\nto project specific circumstances, the\nmajority of approved projects were\ndelivered at or under the original\nApproved Project Estimates (APE).\nAdditional funding was required in approximately 10% of the\nprojects and the amount represented\nsome 8% of the total provision of\nthese projects.\nAlso of importance, this period of time was particularly active\nfor the Industry, with approximately\n850 Category A projects having their\nfinal accounts settled. In terms of\ncost, the original APE of these projects totalled approximately HKD\n240bn as compared with cumulative final accounts of approximately\nHKD 210bn \u2013 leading to an overall\nsurplus of HKD 30bn.\nEffectively, this means the\nsurplus generated at the portfolio\nlevel was more than able to offset\nthe cost overruns incurred by a select\nnumber of projects.\nTo reinforce the positive nature of this performance, Professor\nBent Flyvbjerg of the University of\nOxford pointed out that Hong Kong\nis better than many other regions\nwhen it comes to project cost estimation, based on his findings in a study\ncovering over 100 international jurisdictions.\nMegaprojects are those that\ncome with high levels of procurement, design and/or construction\ncomplexity as well as scale. They\ntypically take multiple years to implement and often involve high levels\nof risk to the participants involved.\nUnfortunately, a number of complex\nmegaprojects in Hong Kong have\nsuffered from underperformance in\nthe form of delays, cost overruns\nand/or quality failures in recent\nyears. These incidents have been\nwell documented through extensive\nmedia coverage \u2013 leading to reduced\nlevels of public confidence in the in\u0002dustry.\nThe early stages of a project\nare crucial and can set the tone and\ninfluence its efficacy. One of the\nchallenges of project performance\nis the sensitivity to timescales in taking corrective action. The later such\nactions are undertaken, the harder\nand more resource intensive it is to\nrectify problems.\nHowever, it is not always\neasy to identify risky projects before\nthings have gone wrong and they re\u0002quire substantial and costly remedy.\nThe Construction Industry Council\nestimates that construction expenditure will increase in real terms by up\nto 42% to HKD 325bn, compared\nto 2021. The Development Bureau\nof the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has launched their\nvision for Construction 2.0 to support effective delivery.\nA key policy objective of the\nDevelopment Bureau is \u2018to ensure\nthe effective planning, management\nand implementation of public sector infrastructure development and\nworks programmes in a safe, timely\nand cost-effective manner and to\nmaintain high quality and standards.\u2019\nIn order to do this, it is vital\nfor senior managers to notice problems and ensure efficient, effective\nand timely intervention when necessary. However, senior managers lack\nthe daily and deep involvement in\ntheir projects. They need the right\nmonitoring tools and early-warning\n-sign systems to help them in their\nproject supervision.\n\n\nTHE EXISTING SYSTEM\nEARLY WARNINGS\nA WEB-BASED MONITORING SYSTEM BASED\nON CASHFLOWS OF HISTORIC PROJECTS\nThe Development Bureau\nuses the PSS, or Project Supervision\nSystem, to monitor capital works\nprojects and provide early-warning\nsignals to senior management. The\nPSS is a web-based application comprising a series of standardized project cashflow graphs.\nThe graphs are based on the\npast cashflows of capital works projects. The PSS covers different categories for building and non-building\nprojects with various construction\ndurations.\nAll active projects submit\ntheir actual cashflows to date and\ntheir planned cashflows for the remainder of the project. The PSS uses\nthis information to identify any unusual patterns.\nThere are 3 types of patterns\nwhich then trigger different followup actions.\nFirst, normal performance.\nThe project cashflow falls within the\ngreen zone. There is no follow-up\naction for projects with normal performance. The data of these projects\nwill be stored for future use and refinement of the system.\nSecond, yellow performance\nraises an alert. The project cashflow\nfalls within the yellow zone, meaning\nheads of departments need to review\nthese projects. The review takes in the\nrisk of cost overrun and programme\ndelay. The heads of departments are\nresponsible for the project assessment\nand, if necessary, for the planning\nand implementation of appropriate\nrecovery measures.\nThird, red performance flags\nthe strongest warning. When the\nproject cashflow falls within the red\nzone, the Permanent Secretary for\nDevelopment (Works) chairs a top\nmanagement meeting, which monitors all projects in this category.\n\nThe monitoring system\nprovides a better understanding of\nvarious elements of a project\u2019s performance. Here are some insightful\nexamples from the first year of using\nthe system.\nThe first project falls into the\nlower yellow zone, which indicates\nslow progress. The question to investigate is whether the project might\nbe able to take actions to catch up\n(purple dotted line), or will be delayed (blue dotted line).\nThe second project falls\ninto the upper yellow zone, which\nindicates fast progress or cost overrun. The team needs to investigate\nwhether the project is indeed making very good progress and will be\ncompleted early (purple dotted line),\nor if the project will experience cost\noverrun (blue dotted line). In either\ncase project plans and budgets might\nneed to be adjusted as a result of the\ninvestigation.\nThe third project falls into\nthe lower red zone and has stayed\npersistently in this zone for more\nthan a year.\nThis can signal a very long\ndelay or an overinflated budget due\nto excessive contingency. In this case,\nthe team investigated the project indepth and found that the project carried too much contingency.\nThe project team reviewed\nthe cost and developed a more realistic project budget. Once the cashflow\nwas adjusted according to the new\nbudget, the cashflow fell back into\nthe normal zone.\n\n\n\nAfter using our monitoring system for over a year, we discovered\nthat instead of it being a mere monitoring tool, the system\nprovides a benchmark and even means to set better target for the\nproject teams\u2019 delivery of their projects. The data of these\nprojects, once completed, will form part of the database\ncreating a self-learning and self-updating system. Hong Kong\u2019s\nproject governance will be enhanced by the positive and\ninteractive feedback between the PSS and the ongoing projects.\n\n\n\nTHE DATA\nThese closed projects have a total outturn cost of HKD 460bn (in\n2019 HKD terms) and individual projects range from HKD 10m to 13bn.\nThe mean project value is HKD 550m.\nThe project durations range from 10 months to 18 years, with an\naverage 3-year duration. In total, the portfolio contains more than 2,700\nyears of construction activity.\nThe average project costs 15% less than forecast, and the range of\ncost outcomes is from 69% below the budget to 59% over budget. There\u2019s\na far greater range in project duration, ranging from 41% shorter than\nplanned to 317% longer than planned. The average delay is 34% for the\ndelayed projects.\nThe historic 2008-17 dataset is representative of current perfor\u0002mance, according to the Development Bureau\u2019s response to the Legislative\nCouncil for projects in 2018-19.\n\n\n\nFIRST FINDING OF THE AI\nPROJECT TYPES\nAI ALGORITHM IDENTIFIED THE GROUPINGS OF PROJECTS THAT\nHAVE A DISTINCTIVE CASHFLOW PATTERN\nTo analyse the cashflow data,\ntwo methods were selected: tracking\nannual performance as a percentage\nof the (1) outturn performance and\n(2) the original plan.\nA relative timeline was de\u0002termined for each project, with the\npercentage of the total duration as\u0002signed to each year. For instance, in a\nfour-year project the first year would\nhave 25% progress, the second 50%\netc.\nThe data for the analysis\ncomprised completed projects con\u0002taining actual outcomes, but the\nforecasted outcomes will be used\nin the future, so the dual reporting\nwill reflect cost and schedule perfor\u0002mance as a percentage of the most\nrecent forecast and the original plan.\nThe analysis used random\nforrests, an artificial intelligence\nmethod to analyse the data. This un\u0002supervised learning algorithm con\u0002sidered all possible characteristics to\ngroup the projects then extracted the\ntypical cashflows from the s-curves\nand compared the fit of the curves.\nAnalysis of the PSS identi\u0002fied that four types of projects had\nstatistically significantly different\noutcomes. The analysis resulted in\na decision tree, where the first deci\u0002sion divides all projects along the\nlines of building or non-building\nprojects. Then the building projects\nare categorised by whether the origi\u0002nal budget was smaller than HKD\n150m or not and the non-building\nprojects were categorised by whether\nthe planned duration was less than\nsix years or not.\n\n\nRESULTS FROM THE AI\nW A R N I N G\nFLAGS\nEach project was assigned a\nwarning flag status; red, amber or\ngreen based on the outcome of the\nproject. If the project finished in the\nmiddle 40% of the historic projects\n(30th\u201370th percentile) the project\ngot a green flag. The bottom and\ntop 5% of the project got a red flag\n(<5th or >95th percentile). All other\nprojects got an amber warning flag\n(5th\u201330th and 70th\u201395th percen\u0002tile).\nAfter assigning the warning\nflag based on the project outcomes\nwe trained three AI algorithms\n(gradient booster, neural network, rolling discretizer) to find out the\nwarning flag status based on progress\nand cashflows.\nThe first AI assigns a warning flag for cost performance. The\nalgorithm looks at progress and then\nthe share of dispensed cash to date\nThe second AI assigns a\nwarning flag for schedule perfor\u0002mance. The algorithm looks at the\nshare of dispensed cash and then at\nthe progress made\nThe rolling discretizer, an algorithm specifically created for this task, achieved the most accurate\npredictions in unseen test data. To\nvalidate the predictive power of the\nalgorithm the data were split into a\ntraining and a test set. The AI learned\nfrom 70% of the data how to assign\nwarning flags. Then the accuracy\nof the warning flags was measured\non the remaining 30% of the data,\nwhich the algorithm had not seen\nbefore.\nThe AI achieves an excellent\nperformance, especially in identify\u0002ing the red projects correctly. The\nperformance is well balanced across\nthe different flags.\n53%\u201369% of all the flags\nassigned to the observations are ac\u0002curate. This means, for example, that\nif the AI assigns a red flag for a cost\noverrun the algorithm is accurate\nnearly 7 out of 10 times.\nThe accuracy of the schedule\nflags is slightly worse. Here the AI is\naccurate in its prediction 18%\u201363%\nof the time.\nThe AI outperforms the split\nby project type, which was only ac\u0002curate in 8%\u201340% of predictions.\nThe AI vastly outperforms\nrandomness. If we simply made an\nuninformed \u201clucky\u201d guess about the\nproject\u2019s risk we would get it right in\n3%\u201325% of times.\nEspecially for the very high\nrisk category \u201cred\u201d the AI is more\nthan 20\u2013times better than a lucky\nguess.\nIn addition to the valida\u0002tion with a test and training set of\nthe data, we tested how little data\nthe AI needs to achieve this level of\naccuracy. The analysis shows that is\npossible with as little as 10% of the\ndata. We were surprised by this find\u0002ing, because we always assumed that\nAI needs lots of data. It turns out we\nwere wrong. Any organisation wish\u0002ing to integrate AI into their early\n-warning-sign system needs some but\nnot vast amounts of data.\nThe AI is far from perfect;\nthe accuracy is surpsingly good even\nthough the algorithm only knew the\ncashflow and type of a project.\nAdding more data in the fu\u0002ture will certainly improve the ac\u0002curacy\n\n\n\nL O O K I N G F O R W A R D\nWITH THE AI\nP R E D I C T I N G\nCOST\nThe accuracy of the warning flag AI is promising enough to train\nmore algorithms on an even more detailed task: forecast the\noutturn cost of projects. A more complex AI, a deep artificial\nneural network, predicted the final outturn cost with an average\nerror of only \u00b18%. The accuracy is as good as a Class 1 estimate.\nThe next challenge we set for\nthe AI algorithms was to predict the\nfinal outturn cost of projects.\nThe AI only knew the per\u0002centage of progress the project had\nachieved so far, measured against the\nplanned project duration at final in\u0002vestment decision and the cashflow\nspent to date as percentage of the\nbudget, that was approved at the fi\u0002nal investment decision.\nFor this challenge we tested\nmany different AI and non-AI algo\u0002rithms, including linear regressions,\nsupport vector machines, gradient\nboosters, random forrest regressions,\nk-nearest neighbours, multilayer\npercepetrons, simple deep neural\nnetworks and complex deep neural\nnetworks.\nWe measured the error of the\npredicted outturn cost in the train\u0002ing data, which tells us how good\nthe AI is at summarising the data it\nknows. We then gave the AI unseen\ndata to test the prediction. As before,\nthe AI used 70% of the data to train\nand 30% for testing.\nThe best performing algo\u0002rithm was the simple deep neural\nnetwork. The mean squared error\nof the predictions for the test data\nwas 1.6 percentage points. The mean\nabsolute error in the test data was 7.9\npercentage points.\nThis means that on aver\u0002age the forecasted outturn cost was\nwithin \u00b18% at the portfolio level.\nThe mean squared error, which is\nsimilar to the standard deviation, is\nonly \u00b11.6%, thus 68% of predictions\nare within a range of \u00b11.6%, 95%\nof predictions are within a range\nof \u00b13.2% and 99.7% of predictions\nare within \u00b14.8% of the predicted\ncost. The mean absolute error of the\nprediction is \u00b17.9%, therefore an\nindication of the skew in the data,\nwhere very large overruns and fat\ntails are not uncommon.\nThe AI estimate is in line\nwith what conventional cost esti\u0002mation practice considers to be the\nbest cost estimate achievable. The\nAssociation for the Advancement of\nCost Engineering (AACE) suggests\nthat international best practice for\na best-in-class cost estimate has an\nerror between \u00b13% and \u00b115%; to\nachieve an estimate with this narrow\nerror range, 100% of design needs to\nbe completed and detailed informa\u0002tion of unit cost and prices needs to\nbe available. The estimate of the AI\nfalls within the range expected for a\nClass 1 cost estimate.\n\n\n\n\nCASE STUDIES\nSPOTTING RISK\nALL HONG KONG PROJECTS ARE MONITORED BY THE PSS.\nTHESE ARE TWO REAL-LIFE CASES WHERE THE AI SPOTTED RISKY\nPROJECTS EARLY\nWe selected two capital works projects from the portfolio to run the AI analyses. Project 1 has an approved project\ncost estimate (APE) of HKD 5.2bn with completion within 3.5 years. Project 2 has an approved budget of HKD\n1.3bn with a construction duration of 3.9 years. Project 1 has completed its first year of construction. Project 2\nhas completed its first two years of construction.\nThe latest cashflow information shows that project 1 has spent 1% of its cash and is nearly 29% complete when\nmeasured against the originally planned duration. Project 2 is 51% complete and has spent 21% of its cash.\nFirst, the AI assigned warning flags. Project 1 has a red flag. Project 1 has been spending the budget slower than\nthe AI anticipates based on the typical spending pattern of capital works projects in Hong Kong. The project\u2019s own\nforecast of spend (dotted line) shows\nthat this trend will reverse in the next\ntwo years and exceed usual patterns\nin years 4 and 5. The AI\u2019s flag raises\nquestions about this unusual profile\nof acceleration and suggests further\ninvestigation.\nProject 2 receives a yellow flag. The\nproject is spending its budget more\nslowly than typical projects but it\nforecasts that it will soon be in line\nwith others. The schedule flags show a similar pattern. Project 1 gets a red\nflag for being very late if it can keep\nup the expenditure as is (under the\nassumption that this is not indicating\na big cost underrun).\nProject 2 is progressing like a typical\nproject in Hong Kong and the AI as\u0002signed a green schedule flag. But the\nAI raises questions about the plans\nafter year 5.\nThe AI also produces a cost forecast\nof the final outturn cost. At the mo- ment Project 1 is forecasted to cost\nHKD 4.0bn. For this estimate, the\nAI assumes that the project will not\nfollow its own forecasted trajectory\nbut behave more like a typical project\nin the future. However, the unusual\npattern of expenditure means that if\nthe project does indeed accelerate its\nspend the cost are likely HKD 5.1bn\nclose to the APE. Project 2 has similar issues. The AI forecasts outturn\ncost of HKD 1.0bn. The project\u2019s\nown forecasts show a spike in spending near the end; if that holds true\nthe AI forecasts spending of HKD\n1.3bn. Again the readiness for acceleration should be investigated.\n\n\nThe enhancement of the PSS does not stop here. Our future plans\ninclude adding more detailed project data, further developing\nthe AI to enhance the predictive power and extending the PSS to\nrailway projects in collaboration with other international regions. Our innovations will not only support Hong Kong\u2019s ambi\u0002tious vision but also benefit projects worldwide.\n\n\nThe Structure is below\n\nSlide 1: Title Slide\n\nSlide 2: Introduction\n- Brief project overview\n- Objective of the presentation\n- Outline of presentation sections and team member responsibilities\n\nSlide 3: Project Background\n- Brief description of the chosen global project\n- Problem statement / goal of the project\n- Countries or locations involved\n\nSlide 4: Brainstorming Techniques - Introduction\n- Importance of creative brainstorming in global projects\n- Brief overview of selected brainstorming techniques\n\nSlides 5-9: Brainstorming Techniques \u2013 Details\n- Explanation of each selected brainstorming technique (one technique per slide) with respect to the project.

This indicates that both societies are more comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty, and they are more adaptable when facing unexpected situations or changes (Hofstede Insights, n.d.).\n\nPossible Implications for the AI in Action Project:\n\n1. Increased Flexibility: Project team members from both Hong Kong and the United Kingdom may be more willing to adapt and adjust their plans when new information or unexpected changes occur. This flexibility can be an advantage when developing the Early Warning Sign System for Public Works Projects, as changes to timelines or project scope may be required during implementation.\n\n2. Risk-Taking Tendencies: Lower Uncertainty Avoidance scores may also indicate a higher tolerance for risk-taking in project decision-making (Hofstede Insights, n.d.). This could lead to more innovative approaches and ideas when implementing the AI in Action project, as both Hong Kong and the United Kingdom project team members may be more open to experimenting with new technologies or methods.\n\n3. Cooperation Across Cultural Differences: Since both Hong Kong and the United Kingdom share relatively similar Uncertainty Avoidance scores, this may foster a greater understanding and cooperation between project team members from the two locations. The shared low tolerance for uncertainty may encourage open communication and collaboration in resolving challenges that arise during the project.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n- Encourage open communication and collaboration between team members from Hong Kong and the United Kingdom in addressing challenges or unexpected events that may arise during the AI in Action project.\n- Foster a culture of innovation and calculated risk-taking within the project team, as both Hong Kong and the United Kingdom share a relatively low Uncertainty Avoidance index score.\n- Be mindful of other cultural differences that may impact project implementation, and consistently seek cross-cultural understanding and learning opportunities.\n\nReferences:\n\nHofstede Insights.

Hong Kong has a very high score, indicating a strong inclination towards long-term planning, perseverance, and adaptability to changing circumstances. In contrast, the United Kingdom has a moderate score, reflecting a more balanced approach between short-term and long-term planning and priorities (Hofstede Insights, n.d.).\n\nPossible Implications for the AI in Action Project:\n\n1. Balancing Long-term and Short-term Goals: The project team should be aware of these cultural differences and work to effectively balance long-term planning and vision with short-term priorities and milestones. Open communication and willingness to understand each other's perspectives will contribute to a successful project implementation.\n\n2. Adapting Strategies and Expectations: Team members from the United Kingdom may need to adapt their expectations and planning strategies to accommodate Hong Kong's more long-term focused approach to decision-making. Conversely, Hong Kong team members may benefit from incorporating the United Kingdom's attention to short-term goals and quicker decision-making when appropriate.\n\n3. Leveraging Strengths: The team can leverage the strengths of each culture to build a more comprehensive and successful project plan. Hong Kong's strong long-term orientation can contribute to the overall strategic planning and vision for the AI in Action project, while the United Kingdom's balanced approach can provide focus on short-term milestones and efficient progress tracking.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n- Encourage open discussion of the different cultural approaches to long-term versus short-term planning and decision-making during project development.\n- Foster mutual understanding and appreciation for each other's cultural differences and be open to adapting planning strategies and expectations as needed.\n- Leverage the strengths of each culture in developing long-term strategic planning and short-term project milestones to create a cohesive and successful AI in Action project implementation plan.\n\nReferences:\n\nHofstede Insights.

However, ten per cent of local projects over-run\ntheir budgets, with a total overspend of eight percent.\nSome flagship projects have over-run their budgets and\ncompletion dates, causing public embarrassment.\nIt is crucial to get these cost and schedule estimates under\ncontrol in order that the booming infrastructure environ\u0002ment in Hong Kong can flourish to its potential while\ncarefully monitoring costs and performance.\nWe investigated whether Artificial Intelligence (AI) can play\na part in accurately predicting these outcomes and identify\u0002ing ahead of time when a project is going off track, allowing\nearly intervention.\nThe large volume of projects in Hong Kong needs to be mon\u0002itored collectively, with a system that allows leaders to focus\ntheir efforts on the projects most likely to fail. An automated\nsystem simplifies this process, and in our studies was found\nto be as accurate as the best-in-class human cost estimates.\nHigh quality data is available in Hong Kong, and we stud\u0002ied a total of 2,700 years of combined construction activity\nand HKD 450bn in construction spent to trial this innova\u0002tive project management approach. We unexpectedly discov\u0002ered, however, that the AI needs only a very small amount\nof data in order to make good predictions.\nWE BELIEVE THESE EARLY FINDINGS WILL\nINFORM A NEW APPROACH TO PROJECT PERFOR\u0002MANCE MONITORING AND LEAD THE WAY IN\nCAPITAL WORKS PROJECTS INTERNATIONALLY\n\n\n\nTHE CHALLENGE\nHong Kong expects project spending to increase by 42% between\n2021 and 2031. The expected annual expenditure will reach up to\nHKD 325bn by 2031.\nHowever, these projects are not without their problems.\nTo spot challenges early, the Project Strategy and Governance\nOffice established a system to support supervision and govern\u0002ance of projects by providing early-warning signals to senior\nleaders of projects that are at risk.\nProjects are used to deliver the\nmost significant initiatives in the world;\nfrom the Olympics, the artificial island\nof Lantau, to the International Space\nStation.\nOne of the challenges currently\nfaced by project leaders and investors is\nthat projects do not perform well.\nThey underperform in terms\nof execution, with significant cost and\nschedule overruns. 50% delays are com\u0002mon.\nOur research has shown this\nwoeful underperformance is so con\u0002sistent that we\u2019ve coined the iron law\nof megaprojects: they are \u2018over budget,\nover time, over and over again\u2019.\nThis poor performance is not a\nrecent phenomenon: it has been fairly\nconsistent for over 70 years. It is also\ncommon to different countries, sectors\nand delivery in the private and public\nsectors.\nThe scale of projects has been\nincreasing for decades. The largest\nmegaprojects have budgets that match\nthe gross domestic products of the larg\u0002est countries.\nThe GDP of Hong Kong\nin 2020 was USD 347bn, a similar\namount to the budget for China\u2019s high\nspeed rail of USD 300bn and the USA\u2019s\njoint strike fighter (USD 400bn). This\nlarge scale means that it is crucial for\nthe money spent on projects to be better\nmanaged.\nThe impacts of funds of this\nsize being mismanaged can be felt on\na national and even international scale.\nOver the period 2008 to 2017, performance on Government projects\nunder the Capital Works Programme\nhas generally been to a good standard, particularly from a budget perspective. Although certain projects\nrequired additional funding owing\nto project specific circumstances, the\nmajority of approved projects were\ndelivered at or under the original\nApproved Project Estimates (APE).\nAdditional funding was required in approximately 10% of the\nprojects and the amount represented\nsome 8% of the total provision of\nthese projects.\nAlso of importance, this period of time was particularly active\nfor the Industry, with approximately\n850 Category A projects having their\nfinal accounts settled. In terms of\ncost, the original APE of these projects totalled approximately HKD\n240bn as compared with cumulative final accounts of approximately\nHKD 210bn \u2013 leading to an overall\nsurplus of HKD 30bn.\nEffectively, this means the\nsurplus generated at the portfolio\nlevel was more than able to offset\nthe cost overruns incurred by a select\nnumber of projects.\nTo reinforce the positive nature of this performance, Professor\nBent Flyvbjerg of the University of\nOxford pointed out that Hong Kong\nis better than many other regions\nwhen it comes to project cost estimation, based on his findings in a study\ncovering over 100 international jurisdictions.\nMegaprojects are those that\ncome with high levels of procurement, design and/or construction\ncomplexity as well as scale. They\ntypically take multiple years to implement and often involve high levels\nof risk to the participants involved.\nUnfortunately, a number of complex\nmegaprojects in Hong Kong have\nsuffered from underperformance in\nthe form of delays, cost overruns\nand/or quality failures in recent\nyears. These incidents have been\nwell documented through extensive\nmedia coverage \u2013 leading to reduced\nlevels of public confidence in the in\u0002dustry.\nThe early stages of a project\nare crucial and can set the tone and\ninfluence its efficacy. One of the\nchallenges of project performance\nis the sensitivity to timescales in taking corrective action. The later such\nactions are undertaken, the harder\nand more resource intensive it is to\nrectify problems.\nHowever, it is not always\neasy to identify risky projects before\nthings have gone wrong and they re\u0002quire substantial and costly remedy.\nThe Construction Industry Council\nestimates that construction expenditure will increase in real terms by up\nto 42% to HKD 325bn, compared\nto 2021. The Development Bureau\nof the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has launched their\nvision for Construction 2.0 to support effective delivery.\nA key policy objective of the\nDevelopment Bureau is \u2018to ensure\nthe effective planning, management\nand implementation of public sector infrastructure development and\nworks programmes in a safe, timely\nand cost-effective manner and to\nmaintain high quality and standards.\u2019\nIn order to do this, it is vital\nfor senior managers to notice problems and ensure efficient, effective\nand timely intervention when necessary. However, senior managers lack\nthe daily and deep involvement in\ntheir projects. They need the right\nmonitoring tools and early-warning\n-sign systems to help them in their\nproject supervision.\n\n\nTHE EXISTING SYSTEM\nEARLY WARNINGS\nA WEB-BASED MONITORING SYSTEM BASED\nON CASHFLOWS OF HISTORIC PROJECTS\nThe Development Bureau\nuses the PSS, or Project Supervision\nSystem, to monitor capital works\nprojects and provide early-warning\nsignals to senior management. The\nPSS is a web-based application comprising a series of standardized project cashflow graphs.\nThe graphs are based on the\npast cashflows of capital works projects. The PSS covers different categories for building and non-building\nprojects with various construction\ndurations.\nAll active projects submit\ntheir actual cashflows to date and\ntheir planned cashflows for the remainder of the project. The PSS uses\nthis information to identify any unusual patterns.\nThere are 3 types of patterns\nwhich then trigger different followup actions.\nFirst, normal performance.\nThe project cashflow falls within the\ngreen zone. There is no follow-up\naction for projects with normal performance. The data of these projects\nwill be stored for future use and refinement of the system.\nSecond, yellow performance\nraises an alert. The project cashflow\nfalls within the yellow zone, meaning\nheads of departments need to review\nthese projects. The review takes in the\nrisk of cost overrun and programme\ndelay. The heads of departments are\nresponsible for the project assessment\nand, if necessary, for the planning\nand implementation of appropriate\nrecovery measures.\nThird, red performance flags\nthe strongest warning. When the\nproject cashflow falls within the red\nzone, the Permanent Secretary for\nDevelopment (Works) chairs a top\nmanagement meeting, which monitors all projects in this category.\n\nThe monitoring system\nprovides a better understanding of\nvarious elements of a project\u2019s performance. Here are some insightful\nexamples from the first year of using\nthe system.\nThe first project falls into the\nlower yellow zone, which indicates\nslow progress. The question to investigate is whether the project might\nbe able to take actions to catch up\n(purple dotted line), or will be delayed (blue dotted line).\nThe second project falls\ninto the upper yellow zone, which\nindicates fast progress or cost overrun. The team needs to investigate\nwhether the project is indeed making very good progress and will be\ncompleted early (purple dotted line),\nor if the project will experience cost\noverrun (blue dotted line). In either\ncase project plans and budgets might\nneed to be adjusted as a result of the\ninvestigation.\nThe third project falls into\nthe lower red zone and has stayed\npersistently in this zone for more\nthan a year.\nThis can signal a very long\ndelay or an overinflated budget due\nto excessive contingency. In this case,\nthe team investigated the project indepth and found that the project carried too much contingency.\nThe project team reviewed\nthe cost and developed a more realistic project budget. Once the cashflow\nwas adjusted according to the new\nbudget, the cashflow fell back into\nthe normal zone.\n\n\n\nAfter using our monitoring system for over a year, we discovered\nthat instead of it being a mere monitoring tool, the system\nprovides a benchmark and even means to set better target for the\nproject teams\u2019 delivery of their projects. The data of these\nprojects, once completed, will form part of the database\ncreating a self-learning and self-updating system. Hong Kong\u2019s\nproject governance will be enhanced by the positive and\ninteractive feedback between the PSS and the ongoing projects.\n\n\n\nTHE DATA\nThese closed projects have a total outturn cost of HKD 460bn (in\n2019 HKD terms) and individual projects range from HKD 10m to 13bn.\nThe mean project value is HKD 550m.\nThe project durations range from 10 months to 18 years, with an\naverage 3-year duration. In total, the portfolio contains more than 2,700\nyears of construction activity.\nThe average project costs 15% less than forecast, and the range of\ncost outcomes is from 69% below the budget to 59% over budget. There\u2019s\na far greater range in project duration, ranging from 41% shorter than\nplanned to 317% longer than planned. The average delay is 34% for the\ndelayed projects.\nThe historic 2008-17 dataset is representative of current perfor\u0002mance, according to the Development Bureau\u2019s response to the Legislative\nCouncil for projects in 2018-19.\n\n\n\nFIRST FINDING OF THE AI\nPROJECT TYPES\nAI ALGORITHM IDENTIFIED THE GROUPINGS OF PROJECTS THAT\nHAVE A DISTINCTIVE CASHFLOW PATTERN\nTo analyse the cashflow data,\ntwo methods were selected: tracking\nannual performance as a percentage\nof the (1) outturn performance and\n(2) the original plan.\nA relative timeline was de\u0002termined for each project, with the\npercentage of the total duration as\u0002signed to each year. For instance, in a\nfour-year project the first year would\nhave 25% progress, the second 50%\netc.\nThe data for the analysis\ncomprised completed projects con\u0002taining actual outcomes, but the\nforecasted outcomes will be used\nin the future, so the dual reporting\nwill reflect cost and schedule perfor\u0002mance as a percentage of the most\nrecent forecast and the original plan.\nThe analysis used random\nforrests, an artificial intelligence\nmethod to analyse the data. This un\u0002supervised learning algorithm con\u0002sidered all possible characteristics to\ngroup the projects then extracted the\ntypical cashflows from the s-curves\nand compared the fit of the curves.\nAnalysis of the PSS identi\u0002fied that four types of projects had\nstatistically significantly different\noutcomes. The analysis resulted in\na decision tree, where the first deci\u0002sion divides all projects along the\nlines of building or non-building\nprojects. Then the building projects\nare categorised by whether the origi\u0002nal budget was smaller than HKD\n150m or not and the non-building\nprojects were categorised by whether\nthe planned duration was less than\nsix years or not.\n\n\nRESULTS FROM THE AI\nW A R N I N G\nFLAGS\nEach project was assigned a\nwarning flag status; red, amber or\ngreen based on the outcome of the\nproject. If the project finished in the\nmiddle 40% of the historic projects\n(30th\u201370th percentile) the project\ngot a green flag. The bottom and\ntop 5% of the project got a red flag\n(<5th or >95th percentile). All other\nprojects got an amber warning flag\n(5th\u201330th and 70th\u201395th percen\u0002tile).\nAfter assigning the warning\nflag based on the project outcomes\nwe trained three AI algorithms\n(gradient booster, neural network, rolling discretizer) to find out the\nwarning flag status based on progress\nand cashflows.\nThe first AI assigns a warning flag for cost performance. The\nalgorithm looks at progress and then\nthe share of dispensed cash to date\nThe second AI assigns a\nwarning flag for schedule perfor\u0002mance. The algorithm looks at the\nshare of dispensed cash and then at\nthe progress made\nThe rolling discretizer, an algorithm specifically created for this task, achieved the most accurate\npredictions in unseen test data. To\nvalidate the predictive power of the\nalgorithm the data were split into a\ntraining and a test set. The AI learned\nfrom 70% of the data how to assign\nwarning flags. Then the accuracy\nof the warning flags was measured\non the remaining 30% of the data,\nwhich the algorithm had not seen\nbefore.\nThe AI achieves an excellent\nperformance, especially in identify\u0002ing the red projects correctly. The\nperformance is well balanced across\nthe different flags.\n53%\u201369% of all the flags\nassigned to the observations are ac\u0002curate. This means, for example, that\nif the AI assigns a red flag for a cost\noverrun the algorithm is accurate\nnearly 7 out of 10 times.\nThe accuracy of the schedule\nflags is slightly worse. Here the AI is\naccurate in its prediction 18%\u201363%\nof the time.\nThe AI outperforms the split\nby project type, which was only ac\u0002curate in 8%\u201340% of predictions.\nThe AI vastly outperforms\nrandomness. If we simply made an\nuninformed \u201clucky\u201d guess about the\nproject\u2019s risk we would get it right in\n3%\u201325% of times.\nEspecially for the very high\nrisk category \u201cred\u201d the AI is more\nthan 20\u2013times better than a lucky\nguess.\nIn addition to the valida\u0002tion with a test and training set of\nthe data, we tested how little data\nthe AI needs to achieve this level of\naccuracy. The analysis shows that is\npossible with as little as 10% of the\ndata. We were surprised by this find\u0002ing, because we always assumed that\nAI needs lots of data. It turns out we\nwere wrong. Any organisation wish\u0002ing to integrate AI into their early\n-warning-sign system needs some but\nnot vast amounts of data.\nThe AI is far from perfect;\nthe accuracy is surpsingly good even\nthough the algorithm only knew the\ncashflow and type of a project.\nAdding more data in the fu\u0002ture will certainly improve the ac\u0002curacy\n\n\n\nL O O K I N G F O R W A R D\nWITH THE AI\nP R E D I C T I N G\nCOST\nThe accuracy of the warning flag AI is promising enough to train\nmore algorithms on an even more detailed task: forecast the\noutturn cost of projects. A more complex AI, a deep artificial\nneural network, predicted the final outturn cost with an average\nerror of only \u00b18%. The accuracy is as good as a Class 1 estimate.\nThe next challenge we set for\nthe AI algorithms was to predict the\nfinal outturn cost of projects.\nThe AI only knew the per\u0002centage of progress the project had\nachieved so far, measured against the\nplanned project duration at final in\u0002vestment decision and the cashflow\nspent to date as percentage of the\nbudget, that was approved at the fi\u0002nal investment decision.\nFor this challenge we tested\nmany different AI and non-AI algo\u0002rithms, including linear regressions,\nsupport vector machines, gradient\nboosters, random forrest regressions,\nk-nearest neighbours, multilayer\npercepetrons, simple deep neural\nnetworks and complex deep neural\nnetworks.\nWe measured the error of the\npredicted outturn cost in the train\u0002ing data, which tells us how good\nthe AI is at summarising the data it\nknows. We then gave the AI unseen\ndata to test the prediction. As before,\nthe AI used 70% of the data to train\nand 30% for testing.\nThe best performing algo\u0002rithm was the simple deep neural\nnetwork. The mean squared error\nof the predictions for the test data\nwas 1.6 percentage points. The mean\nabsolute error in the test data was 7.9\npercentage points.\nThis means that on aver\u0002age the forecasted outturn cost was\nwithin \u00b18% at the portfolio level.\nThe mean squared error, which is\nsimilar to the standard deviation, is\nonly \u00b11.6%, thus 68% of predictions\nare within a range of \u00b11.6%, 95%\nof predictions are within a range\nof \u00b13.2% and 99.7% of predictions\nare within \u00b14.8% of the predicted\ncost. The mean absolute error of the\nprediction is \u00b17.9%, therefore an\nindication of the skew in the data,\nwhere very large overruns and fat\ntails are not uncommon.\nThe AI estimate is in line\nwith what conventional cost esti\u0002mation practice considers to be the\nbest cost estimate achievable. The\nAssociation for the Advancement of\nCost Engineering (AACE) suggests\nthat international best practice for\na best-in-class cost estimate has an\nerror between \u00b13% and \u00b115%; to\nachieve an estimate with this narrow\nerror range, 100% of design needs to\nbe completed and detailed informa\u0002tion of unit cost and prices needs to\nbe available. The estimate of the AI\nfalls within the range expected for a\nClass 1 cost estimate.\n\n\n\n\nCASE STUDIES\nSPOTTING RISK\nALL HONG KONG PROJECTS ARE MONITORED BY THE PSS.\nTHESE ARE TWO REAL-LIFE CASES WHERE THE AI SPOTTED RISKY\nPROJECTS EARLY\nWe selected two capital works projects from the portfolio to run the AI analyses. Project 1 has an approved project\ncost estimate (APE) of HKD 5.2bn with completion within 3.5 years. Project 2 has an approved budget of HKD\n1.3bn with a construction duration of 3.9 years. Project 1 has completed its first year of construction. Project 2\nhas completed its first two years of construction.\nThe latest cashflow information shows that project 1 has spent 1% of its cash and is nearly 29% complete when\nmeasured against the originally planned duration. Project 2 is 51% complete and has spent 21% of its cash.\nFirst, the AI assigned warning flags. Project 1 has a red flag. Project 1 has been spending the budget slower than\nthe AI anticipates based on the typical spending pattern of capital works projects in Hong Kong. The project\u2019s own\nforecast of spend (dotted line) shows\nthat this trend will reverse in the next\ntwo years and exceed usual patterns\nin years 4 and 5. The AI\u2019s flag raises\nquestions about this unusual profile\nof acceleration and suggests further\ninvestigation.\nProject 2 receives a yellow flag. The\nproject is spending its budget more\nslowly than typical projects but it\nforecasts that it will soon be in line\nwith others. The schedule flags show a similar pattern. Project 1 gets a red\nflag for being very late if it can keep\nup the expenditure as is (under the\nassumption that this is not indicating\na big cost underrun).\nProject 2 is progressing like a typical\nproject in Hong Kong and the AI as\u0002signed a green schedule flag. But the\nAI raises questions about the plans\nafter year 5.\nThe AI also produces a cost forecast\nof the final outturn cost. At the mo- ment Project 1 is forecasted to cost\nHKD 4.0bn. For this estimate, the\nAI assumes that the project will not\nfollow its own forecasted trajectory\nbut behave more like a typical project\nin the future. However, the unusual\npattern of expenditure means that if\nthe project does indeed accelerate its\nspend the cost are likely HKD 5.1bn\nclose to the APE. Project 2 has similar issues. The AI forecasts outturn\ncost of HKD 1.0bn. The project\u2019s\nown forecasts show a spike in spending near the end; if that holds true\nthe AI forecasts spending of HKD\n1.3bn. Again the readiness for acceleration should be investigated.\n\n\nThe enhancement of the PSS does not stop here. Our future plans\ninclude adding more detailed project data, further developing\nthe AI to enhance the predictive power and extending the PSS to\nrailway projects in collaboration with other international regions. Our innovations will not only support Hong Kong\u2019s ambi\u0002tious vision but also benefit projects worldwide.\n\n\nThe Structure is below\n\nSlide 1: Title Slide\n\nSlide 2: Introduction\n- Brief project overview\n- Objective of the presentation\n- Outline of presentation sections and team member responsibilities\n\nSlide 3: Project Background\n- Brief description of the chosen global project\n- Problem statement / goal of the project\n- Countries or locations involved\n\nSlide 4: Brainstorming Techniques - Introduction\n- Importance of creative brainstorming in global projects\n- Brief overview of selected brainstorming techniques\n\nSlides 5-9: Brainstorming Techniques \u2013 Details\n- Explanation of each selected brainstorming technique (one technique per slide) with respect to the project.

student, YOu Have a project and the brief goes thus:\n\n\nComponent A is a team presentation of 25 minutes (with 5 minutes of questions).\n\nAs a group you will be required to create a PowerPoint presentation which will detail the planning and management issues of a global project.\n\n1.Choose a project you know off or you are interested in provided it is global, whether completed or in progress, and make sure that you are able to gather the information that is necessary for your analysis;\n\n2.There are two sets of slides in Blackboard > Learning Material > week 1. These slides give you directions how to use UWE resources to find a case project.\n\n3.Use the tools as described below in section 3. Content below and participate in the workshops to practice each tool with your group.\n\nThe presentation will be live, and all group members will present ONE part of the Assignment for which they will be individually marked. Not all group members will get the same mark necessarily, it depends on the quality of their work and presentation in their own part. Group members who do not participate and contribute to the Assignment will have to re-sit as they will get 0. .\n\nThis assessment strategy is employed to produce the type of output required by professional project management practice that is developed by a typical project team; and to maximize learning opportunities with added values for students\u2019 development and character building.\n\nThis assignment requires you to develop research skills and find information that is useful for the purpose of detecting organizational issues related to the global environment and construct a plan. You will have to work with University databases and search through a large volume of information from Professional associations.\n\nIf you have difficulty to choose a global project here are some choices:\n\nSMART CITIES\nEXAMPLES\nhttps://www.apm.org.uk/blog/five-of-the-uk-s-most-exciting-smart-city-projects/\nhttps://publications.iadb.org/en/international-case-studies-smart-cities-santander-spain\n\nGLOBAL HEALTHCARE PROJECTS\nEXAMPLES\nhttps://www.bond.org.uk/news/2017/04/7-projects-improving-healthcare-around-the-world\n\nGLOBAL MEDICAL AND BIOTECH RESEARCH PROJECTS\nEXAMPLES\nhttps://globalprojects.ucsf.edu/\nhttps://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/funding-programmes/global-health.htm\nhttps://www.tendersinfo.com/healthcare-and-medical-pharma-projects.php\nhttps://www.pharmaceuticalonline.com/doc/top-10-international-pharmaceutical-biotech-c-0001\n\nGLOBAL HUMANITARIAN PROJECTS\nEXAMPLES\nhttps://borgenproject.org/5-top-humanitarian-aid-organizations/\nhttps://www.humanitarianprojectsinc.com/\n\nThese are some examples, you can find global projects in most industries.\n\nPlease do not just use Apple, Google or Toyota or any of these famous large organizations because you cannot have access to information about their projects. Choose projects about which you can discover information.\n\nI strongly suggest that you attend the workshops and be proactive in forming groups in week 1 and use the Direction files in the Learning Materials folders showing you case study books to select project case studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.Presentation Content & Structure\nThe live team presentations should not exceed 30 minutes including Q&A and feedback from the tutor. This means that the presentation should be approximately 25 minutes maximum. In a team of 5 people this means that each person will have to present their contribution for 5 minutes.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the team to allocate the parts of the work amongst them.\n\n\nContent\n\nYour task is to present your analysis & plan of a global project. You will choose the project as described in the section above.\n\nSTRUCTURE OF THE PRESENTATION - PARTS:\n\nINTRODUCTION: introduce your project and your team and each team member\u2019s contribution you are going to have a slide where you will attach next to each part the name of the team member who worked at it and who will present it.\n\nANALYSIS PART 1. Evaluate the challenges regarding such a project using the dimensions model from Binder\n\uf0aeEvaluate the impact of environmental factors on this project.\noCollect information about the project environment through industry & professional reports and company literature or case studies. You do not need to do primary research and collect information from the organization people.\n\nPLAN PART 2: Recommend the most appropriate method for managing your project using the Global Project Management Framework from Binder. This part will focus on:\n1.a risk assessment based on the Global Project Management Framework\n2.explain how you will deal with the issues of: international and intercultural communications, global team structures, and collaborative relationships with other organizations in the particular project\n3.The team and project manager roles & skillset [competency maps/leadership framework/Belbin roles]\n\nPLAN PART 3: Construct a Project Plan with objectives, a phase plan and collaboration tools and collaboration techniques as advised by Binder\n*Note: be careful that the type of plan you present is linked to the methodology you chose. For example, if you select a specific agile methodology your plan should be based on the type of iterations of this method.\n\nReferences: reports from industry or from organization/firm, company material and information from reputable sources (case studies, professional magazines articles etc.) and the sources from the models you use to conduct analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.Preparation for Assignment A (mandatory)\n\nStudents are advised to attend the workshops because the Assignment consists of the use of a series of tools, each tool belonging to a part of the Assignment. Please look at the table below to see which workshops correspond to which tools and which parts of the Assignment.\n\n\nWorkshops Section in Assignment A Tool to use Workshop Session\nFind a project\nIntroduction Use the slides Session 1\nDetect the challenges Part 1 The Radar Chart Session 2\nDetect success factors Part 1 The PIP Session 3\nDescribe the team competencies needed Part 2 Competency map Session 4\nDesign the project manager role & leadership Part 2 leadership framework Session 5\nDescribe the teams\u2019 behavioural roles Part 2 Belbin team roles Session 6\nChoose the way your teams will be creative Part 2 Brainstorming Techniques Session 7\nDescribe the cultural differences and challenges in your project Part 2 Hofstede cultural scores Session 8\nExplain how you qill uaw technologies to deal with challenges Part 3 Collaboration platforms Session 9\nDesign project plan for your presentation Part 3 Already known tools Session 10\n\nIn preparing for this assessment, teams will be able to undertake a series of formative exercises and gain feedback in response. Expectations concerning the presentation will be discussed in workshops, and teams will also be able to present ONE draft presentation plan for formative review on the final workshop on week 10.\n\n\n\nYour part of the project is to do the sessions 7 & 8; that is, Choose the way your teams will be creative (Brainstorming Techniques) and Describe the cultural differences and challenges in your project (Hofstede cultural scores)\n\n\n\n\nThe chosen global project is below, with all the information available.:\n\nProject Title:AI IN ACTION (HOW THE HONGKONG DEVELOPMENT BUREAU BUIL THE PSS \u2014\nAN EARLY - WARNING - SIGN SYSTEM FOR PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS)\n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nHong Kong has a large volume of construction works\ncurrently taking place; this will increase further and faster\nin the coming years.\nHong Kong\u2019s projects typically come in 15% under\nbudget. However, ten per cent of local projects over-run\ntheir budgets, with a total overspend of eight percent.\nSome flagship projects have over-run their budgets and\ncompletion dates, causing public embarrassment.\nIt is crucial to get these cost and schedule estimates under\ncontrol in order that the booming infrastructure environ\u0002ment in Hong Kong can flourish to its potential while\ncarefully monitoring costs and performance.\nWe investigated whether Artificial Intelligence (AI) can play\na part in accurately predicting these outcomes and identify\u0002ing ahead of time when a project is going off track, allowing\nearly intervention.\nThe large volume of projects in Hong Kong needs to be mon\u0002itored collectively, with a system that allows leaders to focus\ntheir efforts on the projects most likely to fail. An automated\nsystem simplifies this process, and in our studies was found\nto be as accurate as the best-in-class human cost estimates.\nHigh quality data is available in Hong Kong, and we stud\u0002ied a total of 2,700 years of combined construction activity\nand HKD 450bn in construction spent to trial this innova\u0002tive project management approach. We unexpectedly discov\u0002ered, however, that the AI needs only a very small amount\nof data in order to make good predictions.\nWE BELIEVE THESE EARLY FINDINGS WILL\nINFORM A NEW APPROACH TO PROJECT PERFOR\u0002MANCE MONITORING AND LEAD THE WAY IN\nCAPITAL WORKS PROJECTS INTERNATIONALLY\n\n\n\nTHE CHALLENGE\nHong Kong expects project spending to increase by 42% between\n2021 and 2031. The expected annual expenditure will reach up to\nHKD 325bn by 2031.\nHowever, these projects are not without their problems.\nTo spot challenges early, the Project Strategy and Governance\nOffice established a system to support supervision and govern\u0002ance of projects by providing early-warning signals to senior\nleaders of projects that are at risk.\nProjects are used to deliver the\nmost significant initiatives in the world;\nfrom the Olympics, the artificial island\nof Lantau, to the International Space\nStation.\nOne of the challenges currently\nfaced by project leaders and investors is\nthat projects do not perform well.\nThey underperform in terms\nof execution, with significant cost and\nschedule overruns. 50% delays are com\u0002mon.\nOur research has shown this\nwoeful underperformance is so con\u0002sistent that we\u2019ve coined the iron law\nof megaprojects: they are \u2018over budget,\nover time, over and over again\u2019.\nThis poor performance is not a\nrecent phenomenon: it has been fairly\nconsistent for over 70 years. It is also\ncommon to different countries, sectors\nand delivery in the private and public\nsectors.\nThe scale of projects has been\nincreasing for decades. The largest\nmegaprojects have budgets that match\nthe gross domestic products of the larg\u0002est countries.\nThe GDP of Hong Kong\nin 2020 was USD 347bn, a similar\namount to the budget for China\u2019s high\nspeed rail of USD 300bn and the USA\u2019s\njoint strike fighter (USD 400bn). This\nlarge scale means that it is crucial for\nthe money spent on projects to be better\nmanaged.\nThe impacts of funds of this\nsize being mismanaged can be felt on\na national and even international scale.\nOver the period 2008 to 2017, performance on Government projects\nunder the Capital Works Programme\nhas generally been to a good standard, particularly from a budget perspective. Although certain projects\nrequired additional funding owing\nto project specific circumstances, the\nmajority of approved projects were\ndelivered at or under the original\nApproved Project Estimates (APE).\nAdditional funding was required in approximately 10% of the\nprojects and the amount represented\nsome 8% of the total provision of\nthese projects.\nAlso of importance, this period of time was particularly active\nfor the Industry, with approximately\n850 Category A projects having their\nfinal accounts settled. In terms of\ncost, the original APE of these projects totalled approximately HKD\n240bn as compared with cumulative final accounts of approximately\nHKD 210bn \u2013 leading to an overall\nsurplus of HKD 30bn.\nEffectively, this means the\nsurplus generated at the portfolio\nlevel was more than able to offset\nthe cost overruns incurred by a select\nnumber of projects.\nTo reinforce the positive nature of this performance, Professor\nBent Flyvbjerg of the University of\nOxford pointed out that Hong Kong\nis better than many other regions\nwhen it comes to project cost estimation, based on his findings in a study\ncovering over 100 international jurisdictions.\nMegaprojects are those that\ncome with high levels of procurement, design and/or construction\ncomplexity as well as scale. They\ntypically take multiple years to implement and often involve high levels\nof risk to the participants involved.\nUnfortunately, a number of complex\nmegaprojects in Hong Kong have\nsuffered from underperformance in\nthe form of delays, cost overruns\nand/or quality failures in recent\nyears. These incidents have been\nwell documented through extensive\nmedia coverage \u2013 leading to reduced\nlevels of public confidence in the in\u0002dustry.\nThe early stages of a project\nare crucial and can set the tone and\ninfluence its efficacy. One of the\nchallenges of project performance\nis the sensitivity to timescales in taking corrective action. The later such\nactions are undertaken, the harder\nand more resource intensive it is to\nrectify problems.\nHowever, it is not always\neasy to identify risky projects before\nthings have gone wrong and they re\u0002quire substantial and costly remedy.\nThe Construction Industry Council\nestimates that construction expenditure will increase in real terms by up\nto 42% to HKD 325bn, compared\nto 2021. The Development Bureau\nof the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has launched their\nvision for Construction 2.0 to support effective delivery.\nA key policy objective of the\nDevelopment Bureau is \u2018to ensure\nthe effective planning, management\nand implementation of public sector infrastructure development and\nworks programmes in a safe, timely\nand cost-effective manner and to\nmaintain high quality and standards.\u2019\nIn order to do this, it is vital\nfor senior managers to notice problems and ensure efficient, effective\nand timely intervention when necessary. However, senior managers lack\nthe daily and deep involvement in\ntheir projects. They need the right\nmonitoring tools and early-warning\n-sign systems to help them in their\nproject supervision.\n\n\nTHE EXISTING SYSTEM\nEARLY WARNINGS\nA WEB-BASED MONITORING SYSTEM BASED\nON CASHFLOWS OF HISTORIC PROJECTS\nThe Development Bureau\nuses the PSS, or Project Supervision\nSystem, to monitor capital works\nprojects and provide early-warning\nsignals to senior management. The\nPSS is a web-based application comprising a series of standardized project cashflow graphs.\nThe graphs are based on the\npast cashflows of capital works projects. The PSS covers different categories for building and non-building\nprojects with various construction\ndurations.\nAll active projects submit\ntheir actual cashflows to date and\ntheir planned cashflows for the remainder of the project. The PSS uses\nthis information to identify any unusual patterns.\nThere are 3 types of patterns\nwhich then trigger different followup actions.\nFirst, normal performance.\nThe project cashflow falls within the\ngreen zone. There is no follow-up\naction for projects with normal performance. The data of these projects\nwill be stored for future use and refinement of the system.\nSecond, yellow performance\nraises an alert. The project cashflow\nfalls within the yellow zone, meaning\nheads of departments need to review\nthese projects. The review takes in the\nrisk of cost overrun and programme\ndelay. The heads of departments are\nresponsible for the project assessment\nand, if necessary, for the planning\nand implementation of appropriate\nrecovery measures.\nThird, red performance flags\nthe strongest warning. When the\nproject cashflow falls within the red\nzone, the Permanent Secretary for\nDevelopment (Works) chairs a top\nmanagement meeting, which monitors all projects in this category.\n\nThe monitoring system\nprovides a better understanding of\nvarious elements of a project\u2019s performance. Here are some insightful\nexamples from the first year of using\nthe system.\nThe first project falls into the\nlower yellow zone, which indicates\nslow progress. The question to investigate is whether the project might\nbe able to take actions to catch up\n(purple dotted line), or will be delayed (blue dotted line).\nThe second project falls\ninto the upper yellow zone, which\nindicates fast progress or cost overrun. The team needs to investigate\nwhether the project is indeed making very good progress and will be\ncompleted early (purple dotted line),\nor if the project will experience cost\noverrun (blue dotted line). In either\ncase project plans and budgets might\nneed to be adjusted as a result of the\ninvestigation.\nThe third project falls into\nthe lower red zone and has stayed\npersistently in this zone for more\nthan a year.\nThis can signal a very long\ndelay or an overinflated budget due\nto excessive contingency. In this case,\nthe team investigated the project indepth and found that the project carried too much contingency.\nThe project team reviewed\nthe cost and developed a more realistic project budget. Once the cashflow\nwas adjusted according to the new\nbudget, the cashflow fell back into\nthe normal zone.\n\n\n\nAfter using our monitoring system for over a year, we discovered\nthat instead of it being a mere monitoring tool, the system\nprovides a benchmark and even means to set better target for the\nproject teams\u2019 delivery of their projects. The data of these\nprojects, once completed, will form part of the database\ncreating a self-learning and self-updating system. Hong Kong\u2019s\nproject governance will be enhanced by the positive and\ninteractive feedback between the PSS and the ongoing projects.\n\n\n\nTHE DATA\nThese closed projects have a total outturn cost of HKD 460bn (in\n2019 HKD terms) and individual projects range from HKD 10m to 13bn.\nThe mean project value is HKD 550m.\nThe project durations range from 10 months to 18 years, with an\naverage 3-year duration. In total, the portfolio contains more than 2,700\nyears of construction activity.\nThe average project costs 15% less than forecast, and the range of\ncost outcomes is from 69% below the budget to 59% over budget. There\u2019s\na far greater range in project duration, ranging from 41% shorter than\nplanned to 317% longer than planned. The average delay is 34% for the\ndelayed projects.\nThe historic 2008-17 dataset is representative of current perfor\u0002mance, according to the Development Bureau\u2019s response to the Legislative\nCouncil for projects in 2018-19.\n\n\n\nFIRST FINDING OF THE AI\nPROJECT TYPES\nAI ALGORITHM IDENTIFIED THE GROUPINGS OF PROJECTS THAT\nHAVE A DISTINCTIVE CASHFLOW PATTERN\nTo analyse the cashflow data,\ntwo methods were selected: tracking\nannual performance as a percentage\nof the (1) outturn performance and\n(2) the original plan.\nA relative timeline was de\u0002termined for each project, with the\npercentage of the total duration as\u0002signed to each year. For instance, in a\nfour-year project the first year would\nhave 25% progress, the second 50%\netc.\nThe data for the analysis\ncomprised completed projects con\u0002taining actual outcomes, but the\nforecasted outcomes will be used\nin the future, so the dual reporting\nwill reflect cost and schedule perfor\u0002mance as a percentage of the most\nrecent forecast and the original plan.\nThe analysis used random\nforrests, an artificial intelligence\nmethod to analyse the data. This un\u0002supervised learning algorithm con\u0002sidered all possible characteristics to\ngroup the projects then extracted the\ntypical cashflows from the s-curves\nand compared the fit of the curves.\nAnalysis of the PSS identi\u0002fied that four types of projects had\nstatistically significantly different\noutcomes. The analysis resulted in\na decision tree, where the first deci\u0002sion divides all projects along the\nlines of building or non-building\nprojects. Then the building projects\nare categorised by whether the origi\u0002nal budget was smaller than HKD\n150m or not and the non-building\nprojects were categorised by whether\nthe planned duration was less than\nsix years or not.\n\n\nRESULTS FROM THE AI\nW A R N I N G\nFLAGS\nEach project was assigned a\nwarning flag status; red, amber or\ngreen based on the outcome of the\nproject. If the project finished in the\nmiddle 40% of the historic projects\n(30th\u201370th percentile) the project\ngot a green flag. The bottom and\ntop 5% of the project got a red flag\n(<5th or >95th percentile). All other\nprojects got an amber warning flag\n(5th\u201330th and 70th\u201395th percen\u0002tile).\nAfter assigning the warning\nflag based on the project outcomes\nwe trained three AI algorithms\n(gradient booster, neural network, rolling discretizer) to find out the\nwarning flag status based on progress\nand cashflows.\nThe first AI assigns a warning flag for cost performance. The\nalgorithm looks at progress and then\nthe share of dispensed cash to date\nThe second AI assigns a\nwarning flag for schedule perfor\u0002mance. The algorithm looks at the\nshare of dispensed cash and then at\nthe progress made\nThe rolling discretizer, an algorithm specifically created for this task, achieved the most accurate\npredictions in unseen test data. To\nvalidate the predictive power of the\nalgorithm the data were split into a\ntraining and a test set. The AI learned\nfrom 70% of the data how to assign\nwarning flags. Then the accuracy\nof the warning flags was measured\non the remaining 30% of the data,\nwhich the algorithm had not seen\nbefore.\nThe AI achieves an excellent\nperformance, especially in identify\u0002ing the red projects correctly. The\nperformance is well balanced across\nthe different flags.\n53%\u201369% of all the flags\nassigned to the observations are ac\u0002curate. This means, for example, that\nif the AI assigns a red flag for a cost\noverrun the algorithm is accurate\nnearly 7 out of 10 times.\nThe accuracy of the schedule\nflags is slightly worse. Here the AI is\naccurate in its prediction 18%\u201363%\nof the time.\nThe AI outperforms the split\nby project type, which was only ac\u0002curate in 8%\u201340% of predictions.\nThe AI vastly outperforms\nrandomness. If we simply made an\nuninformed \u201clucky\u201d guess about the\nproject\u2019s risk we would get it right in\n3%\u201325% of times.\nEspecially for the very high\nrisk category \u201cred\u201d the AI is more\nthan 20\u2013times better than a lucky\nguess.\nIn addition to the valida\u0002tion with a test and training set of\nthe data, we tested how little data\nthe AI needs to achieve this level of\naccuracy. The analysis shows that is\npossible with as little as 10% of the\ndata. We were surprised by this find\u0002ing, because we always assumed that\nAI needs lots of data. It turns out we\nwere wrong. Any organisation wish\u0002ing to integrate AI into their early\n-warning-sign system needs some but\nnot vast amounts of data.\nThe AI is far from perfect;\nthe accuracy is surpsingly good even\nthough the algorithm only knew the\ncashflow and type of a project.\nAdding more data in the fu\u0002ture will certainly improve the ac\u0002curacy\n\n\n\nL O O K I N G F O R W A R D\nWITH THE AI\nP R E D I C T I N G\nCOST\nThe accuracy of the warning flag AI is promising enough to train\nmore algorithms on an even more detailed task: forecast the\noutturn cost of projects. A more complex AI, a deep artificial\nneural network, predicted the final outturn cost with an average\nerror of only \u00b18%. The accuracy is as good as a Class 1 estimate.\nThe next challenge we set for\nthe AI algorithms was to predict the\nfinal outturn cost of projects.\nThe AI only knew the per\u0002centage of progress the project had\nachieved so far, measured against the\nplanned project duration at final in\u0002vestment decision and the cashflow\nspent to date as percentage of the\nbudget, that was approved at the fi\u0002nal investment decision.\nFor this challenge we tested\nmany different AI and non-AI algo\u0002rithms, including linear regressions,\nsupport vector machines, gradient\nboosters, random forrest regressions,\nk-nearest neighbours, multilayer\npercepetrons, simple deep neural\nnetworks and complex deep neural\nnetworks.\nWe measured the error of the\npredicted outturn cost in the train\u0002ing data, which tells us how good\nthe AI is at summarising the data it\nknows. We then gave the AI unseen\ndata to test the prediction. As before,\nthe AI used 70% of the data to train\nand 30% for testing.\nThe best performing algo\u0002rithm was the simple deep neural\nnetwork. The mean squared error\nof the predictions for the test data\nwas 1.6 percentage points. The mean\nabsolute error in the test data was 7.9\npercentage points.\nThis means that on aver\u0002age the forecasted outturn cost was\nwithin \u00b18% at the portfolio level.\nThe mean squared error, which is\nsimilar to the standard deviation, is\nonly \u00b11.6%, thus 68% of predictions\nare within a range of \u00b11.6%, 95%\nof predictions are within a range\nof \u00b13.2% and 99.7% of predictions\nare within \u00b14.8% of the predicted\ncost. The mean absolute error of the\nprediction is \u00b17.9%, therefore an\nindication of the skew in the data,\nwhere very large overruns and fat\ntails are not uncommon.\nThe AI estimate is in line\nwith what conventional cost esti\u0002mation practice considers to be the\nbest cost estimate achievable. The\nAssociation for the Advancement of\nCost Engineering (AACE) suggests\nthat international best practice for\na best-in-class cost estimate has an\nerror between \u00b13% and \u00b115%; to\nachieve an estimate with this narrow\nerror range, 100% of design needs to\nbe completed and detailed informa\u0002tion of unit cost and prices needs to\nbe available. The estimate of the AI\nfalls within the range expected for a\nClass 1 cost estimate.\n\n\n\n\nCASE STUDIES\nSPOTTING RISK\nALL HONG KONG PROJECTS ARE MONITORED BY THE PSS.\nTHESE ARE TWO REAL-LIFE CASES WHERE THE AI SPOTTED RISKY\nPROJECTS EARLY\nWe selected two capital works projects from the portfolio to run the AI analyses. Project 1 has an approved project\ncost estimate (APE) of HKD 5.2bn with completion within 3.5 years. Project 2 has an approved budget of HKD\n1.3bn with a construction duration of 3.9 years. Project 1 has completed its first year of construction. Project 2\nhas completed its first two years of construction.\nThe latest cashflow information shows that project 1 has spent 1% of its cash and is nearly 29% complete when\nmeasured against the originally planned duration. Project 2 is 51% complete and has spent 21% of its cash.\nFirst, the AI assigned warning flags. Project 1 has a red flag. Project 1 has been spending the budget slower than\nthe AI anticipates based on the typical spending pattern of capital works projects in Hong Kong. The project\u2019s own\nforecast of spend (dotted line) shows\nthat this trend will reverse in the next\ntwo years and exceed usual patterns\nin years 4 and 5. The AI\u2019s flag raises\nquestions about this unusual profile\nof acceleration and suggests further\ninvestigation.\nProject 2 receives a yellow flag. The\nproject is spending its budget more\nslowly than typical projects but it\nforecasts that it will soon be in line\nwith others. The schedule flags show a similar pattern. Project 1 gets a red\nflag for being very late if it can keep\nup the expenditure as is (under the\nassumption that this is not indicating\na big cost underrun).\nProject 2 is progressing like a typical\nproject in Hong Kong and the AI as\u0002signed a green schedule flag. But the\nAI raises questions about the plans\nafter year 5.\nThe AI also produces a cost forecast\nof the final outturn cost. At the mo- ment Project 1 is forecasted to cost\nHKD 4.0bn. For this estimate, the\nAI assumes that the project will not\nfollow its own forecasted trajectory\nbut behave more like a typical project\nin the future. However, the unusual\npattern of expenditure means that if\nthe project does indeed accelerate its\nspend the cost are likely HKD 5.1bn\nclose to the APE. Project 2 has similar issues. The AI forecasts outturn\ncost of HKD 1.0bn. The project\u2019s\nown forecasts show a spike in spending near the end; if that holds true\nthe AI forecasts spending of HKD\n1.3bn. Again the readiness for acceleration should be investigated.\n\n\nThe enhancement of the PSS does not stop here. Our future plans\ninclude adding more detailed project data, further developing\nthe AI to enhance the predictive power and extending the PSS to\nrailway projects in collaboration with other international regions. Our innovations will not only support Hong Kong\u2019s ambi\u0002tious vision but also benefit projects worldwide.\n\n\nThe Structure is below\n\nSlide 1: Title Slide\n\nSlide 2: Introduction\n- Brief project overview\n- Objective of the presentation\n- Outline of presentation sections and team member responsibilities\n\nSlide 3: Project Background\n- Brief description of the chosen global project\n- Problem statement / goal of the project\n- Countries or locations involved\n\nSlide 4: Brainstorming Techniques - Introduction\n- Importance of creative brainstorming in global projects\n- Brief overview of selected brainstorming techniques\n\nSlides 5-9: Brainstorming Techniques \u2013 Details\n- Explanation of each selected brainstorming technique (one technique per slide) with respect to the project.

It helps to visualize the flow of events or processes and can assist in identifying potential issues or bottlenecks.\n- Application in AI in Action project: Team members can use storyboarding to visualize the timeline of the project, each stage of the AI implementation, or the interface of the early-warning sign system for public works projects. This will help team members understand the project flow and identify areas that may require further attention, optimization, or improvement.\n- Benefits: \n  1. Provides a visual representation of ideas, making it easier for everyone to understand the project flow and structure.\n  2. Encourages creative thinking and collaboration among team members with diverse backgrounds and expertise.\n  3. Can help identify potential issues, risks, or bottlenecks early on in the project, allowing for efficient problem-solving and decision-making.\n  4. Can be used for effective communication between stakeholders, as visuals are usually more easily understood than text-heavy presentations.\n- Example: In the AI in Action project, the Development Bureau, construction planners, and AI experts can use a storyboard to illustrate the steps taken to enhance the PSS system through AI algorithms, including the process of collecting and analyzing data, determining warning flags, and predicting project outcomes (Development Bureau, n.d.).\n\nReference:\nDevelopment Bureau.

Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. First, we need to gather a list of prompts that we want the generator to be able to create. These prompts should be specific enough to guide the output but general enough to allow for variation and creativity.\n\n2. We can use the GPT-3 API to create a custom model that is trained on our list of prompts. This will allow the model to recognize and generate text based on the patterns and structures of our prompts.\n\n3. Once we have our trained model, we can use it to generate prompts by feeding it an input sentence or phrase. The model will then use its knowledge of the prompts to generate a new, related prompt that follows the same structure and style.\n\n4. We can refine the generated prompts by using additional techniques such as filtering out certain words or phrases or reordering the output sentences.\n\n5. Finally, we can integrate the Chatgpt prompt generator into a user-friendly interface where users can input their desired prompt and receive a generated output.\n\nWith this approach, we can create a powerful tool for generating prompts that are tailored to specific needs, whether it's for marketing copy, creative writing, or any other purpose.

Privacy and security: Certain types of information, such as personal data or sensitive government documents, need to be protected to ensure the privacy and safety of individuals and nations.\n\n2. Intellectual property: Creators and inventors have the right to protect their work and ideas through copyrights, patents, and other legal mechanisms. This can sometimes limit the free sharing of certain types of knowledge.\n\n3. Misinformation and manipulation: The unrestricted sharing of information can also lead to the spread of misinformation, propaganda, or harmful content, which can have negative consequences for individuals and society as a whole.\n\n4. Quality control: Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of information can be challenging when all knowledge is freely available. This can make it difficult for people to discern between credible sources and unreliable ones.\n\nDespite these challenges, the pursuit of knowledge and the desire for transparency are generally seen as positive traits.

The topic I found most compelling in the GHDI chapters was the role of science, particularly physics, in Nazi Germany. The image \u201cAlbert Einstein: Authorial Fame Seems to be Relative!\u201d is a caricature of Einstein published in Kladderadatsch in September 1933, where his political activity is portrayed in relation to his scientific achievements. It represents the attempt by the Nazi regime to discredit both Einstein and his contributions to science due to his Jewish ancestry and opposition to Nazi policies. This image speaks to me as it illustrates the harmful consequences that can arise when politics interferes with scientific progress, and the importance of preserving academic independence.\n\n2. After visiting the Shoa Foundation Website and United States Holocaust Museum site and listening to testimonies related to \"racial science,\" I specifically learned how \"science\" was used by the Nazis to justify discrimination, persecution, and violence against various groups, especially Jews. The Nazis believed in a hierarchy of races, with Aryans at the top and Jews at the bottom, and sought to \"improve\" the German nation by eliminating undesirable elements. Racial hygiene programs, such as forced sterilizations and euthanasia, aimed to eliminate those considered \"unfit\" to reproduce or live in society. This tragic misuse of science highlights the importance of ethical standards in scientific research and the need for vigilance against the spread of pseudoscience and harmful ideologies.\n\n3. I revisited the website of Bayer, a German multinational pharmaceutical and life sciences company. Although they address their history during the Nazi period in a section about the company's history, they briefly mention their involvement in forced labor and IG Farben's role in the Holocaust. Upon further investigation, Bayer's parent company, IG Farben, was a major supplier of chemicals during World War II and played a significant role in the Holocaust, producing Zyklon B, the deadly gas used in extermination camps. I believe it's important for such companies to be transparent about their past, take responsibility for their actions, and ensure that they remain committed to conducting their business ethically today.\n\n4. In Nazi Germany, scientists played a significant role in promoting and implementing the regime's policies. From a humanitarian perspective, many scientists were complicit in atrocities committed during the Holocaust, such as conducting harmful medical experiments, designing and producing weapons, and participating in euthanasia programs. Socially, scientists who were members of the Nazi Party held prominent positions in research institutions and contributed to the development of a racially segregated scientific community. Scientifically, the dismissal of Jewish scientists and the focus on politically motivated research stunted the progress of German science during this period, leading to a loss of talent and harmful consequences for the nation.\n\n5.

A key point of this theory is that individuals may experience identity conflict and change in their lives.\n\nIn my own life, I faced a situation where I had to move from the country in which I was born to Canada for my education. This transition made me experience identity conflict due to the difference in cultural values, making me question my beliefs and priorities.

The story's focus on love, longing, and the search for happiness in an otherwise dreary existence is reminiscent of themes found in works by Romantic poets like Pablo Neruda or Gustavo Adolfo B\u00e9cquer.\n\nIn terms of the blending of reality and dreams, it can also remind readers of magical realism, a genre commonly found in Latin American literature, where elements of the fantastical are woven seamlessly into an otherwise realistic narrative. This can be seen in works of writers such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Isabel Allende.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of an individual trapped in an oppressive environment and seeking solace through art and a connection with a loved one bears similarities to Fyodor Dostoevsky's \"Notes from Underground\" or some of Franz Kafka's works, like \"The Metamorphosis.\"\n\nWhile it's challenging to pinpoint a single work that is the most similar, an example could be \"Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair\" by Pablo Neruda. This collection of poems explores themes of love, desire, and heartache, all conveyed through vivid imagery and passionate language, much like the emotions expressed in the text provided."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What interpretations or meanings do you think this text has?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are several interpretations and meanings that can be drawn from this text:\n\n1. The power of love and memories: The text highlights the profound emotions that love and memories evoke. The narrator's recollections of their time with Ligia or Luiza bring happiness and an escape from their bleak reality. This serves to emphasize the importance of human connections in providing solace and meaning in life.\n\n2. The power of art and creativity: The text also explores the role of art and creativity in coping with life's challenges. The narrator's yearning to be a writer and their appreciation for Ligia or Luiza's photography skills suggest that artistic expression allows individuals to make sense of their world and express their deepest emotions.\n\n3. The theme of escape and dreams: The text delves into the idea of escape through memories, dreams, and fantasies. The intertwining of reality and dreams allow the narrator to momentarily escape the monotony and sadness of their daily life. However, the fleeting nature of these experiences is emphasized when the narrator wakes up and faces reality once again.\n\n4. The struggle for freedom and individuality: The text hints at the narrator's struggle to break free from oppressive circumstances\u2014a mundane job, societal expectations, and limitations that hamper their pursuit of true love and fulfillment. Their desire to be with Ligia or Luiza, along with their longing to be an accomplished writer, symbolizes their quest for a genuinely meaningful life.\n\n5. The impermanence of happiness: The text explores the idea that happiness is often temporary, fleeting, and difficult to capture. Despite the beautiful memories and experiences shared between the narrator and Ligia or Luiza, the reality of their separation and the challenges they face in their lives serve as a reminder of the transient nature of happiness."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Could you provide me with more?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly, here are additional interpretations and meanings for the text:\n\n6. The role of language and cultural connections: The text uses both Spanish and Portuguese to tell the story, illustrating the blending of two cultures and languages within the relationship. The mix of languages demonstrates how love transcends cultural barriers and highlights the power of shared experiences that bring people together.\n\n7. Nostalgia and longing for the past: The narrative emphasizes the power of nostalgia and the yearning to reconnect with the past. The narrator's vivid memories of their time with Ligia or Luiza bring both joy and sadness, as they realize they cannot return to the same time and place. Their longing for what once was demonstrates the deep emotional ties people have with their past experiences.\n\n8. Juxtaposition of beauty and bleakness: The text explores the stark contrast between moments of beauty, like the tender memories with Ligia or Luiza, and the bleak, oppressive environment that the narrator faces every day. This juxtaposition serves as a reminder of the duality of human existence and the struggle to find beauty amidst life's harsh realities.\n\n9. The transformative power of love: In the story, the narrator's experiences with Ligia or Luiza seem to bring color and life to their otherwise dull existence. Their love transforms the world around them, turning it into something enchanting and magical. This emphasizes the notion that love has the power to change our perception of the world and breathe life into even the dullest of circumstances.\n\n10. The search for identity and purpose: The text hints at the narrator's struggle to find their true identity and purpose in life. Their pursuit of love and a meaningful career as a writer shows their desire to carve their own path and achieve self-fulfillment. In this sense, the story serves as a reflection on the human condition and its innate drive toward self-discovery and personal growth."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What do you think about the numerous allusions to the idea of reincarnation in the text? Do you think there may be another interpretation based on this idea?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The numerous allusions to the idea of reincarnation in the text are indeed interesting and can reveal an alternative interpretation:\n\n11. The eternal cycle of love and destiny: The references to reincarnation suggest that the love between the narrator and Ligia or Luiza transcends the boundaries of a single lifetime. This can be seen when the narrator mentions living a thousand past lives with Ligia and being destined to live a thousand more together. This presents the interpretation that their love and connection are so profound that they continue to find each other across multiple lifetimes.\n\nThe idea of eternal love and destiny could also signify the persistence of human connections and emotions that surpass temporal barriers. It emphasizes the notion that some bonds are so strong and meaningful that they are carried across different points in time and space, providing solace and a sense of constancy amidst the ever-changing landscape of life.\n\nIn this context, the reincarnation theme serves to highlight the spiritual connection between the characters and the timeless nature of their love. It showcases the resilience of human emotions and how enduring relationships can persist through various stages of existence, ultimately providing comfort and continuity in the face of life's impermanence."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How deeply is this text inspired by Brazilian culture?

While it's difficult to assert how deeply the text is inspired by Brazilian culture without a more extensive analysis, the prose seems to incorporate some local flavors and cultural touchpoints.\n\nAs for hidden songs or literary works, it is not immediately apparent if there are direct references to specific works. However, given the poetic and romantic nature of the text, it's possible that the author may have taken inspiration from various sources, including Brazilian music and literature, which often explore themes of love, longing, and the beauty of life.\n\nThe mention of the Lotus flower along with the Nile River can indeed be considered another allusion to the theme of reincarnation. In various spiritual and mythological contexts, the Lotus flower symbolizes rebirth, transformation, and spiritual awakening due to its ability to emerge from muddy waters as a pristine and beautiful bloom. Similarly, the Nile River has long been associated with life, renewal, and fertility in ancient Egyptian mythology and religion.\n\nIncluding these symbols in the text reinforces the theme of rebirth and eternal cycles of love that transcend the boundaries of a single lifetime.

Language consistency: While the blend of Spanish and Portuguese adds an interesting cultural dimension, it might cause some confusion for readers who are not familiar with both languages. The author could consider using one primary language or ensure that the other language is incorporated more smoothly, providing clues or translations to maintain the flow and understanding for a broader audience.\n\n2. Character names: The text refers to Ligia and Luiza, which may leave readers wondering if they are intended to be the same person, or if they represent different aspects of the same character. Providing additional context or clarifying the relationship between these names could help readers achieve a deeper understanding of the narrative.\n\n3. Strengthen the structure and transitions: Some parts of the text shift abruptly between reality and dreams, emotions, and settings. Although this adds to the blending of reality and dreams, clearer transitions, or a more defined structure might help the reader to better follow the narrative without compromising the richness of the text.\n\n4. Expand on cultural elements: Given the question about the text's inspiration from Brazilian culture, the author could consider integrating more specific cultural references or elements into the story to enrich the narrative's sense of place and provide a deeper connection to the characters and their experiences.\n\n5. Further development of themes: The text explores multiple themes, like the interplay between art and life, reincarnation, and the search for purpose.

This ethnocentric positioning perceives the Europe or West as a paragon of universal values and cultural superiority, leading to a systematic undervaluation and misrepresentation of non-European cultures. Consequently, Eurocentric discourse breeds a false dichotomy between the West and non-European societies, perpetuating the notion that the West is superior and in control of all areas of life, including social, political, cultural, scientific, military, and economic fields. Disparaging epithets are often attributed to the \u201cnon-West,\u201d reinforcing connotations of inferiority, irrationality, belligerence, otherness, fanaticism, and barbarism in comparison to the West. This paradigm, therefore, not only consolidates the stature of the West, but also perpetuates the subordination of non-European societies within global power structures, and the spheres of knowledge and influence. This belief in Western superiority is often reinforced through various forms of discourse, including history, literature, art, music, etc. In a similar vein, through the utilization of Eurocentric and imperialistic perspectives, academic discourse has consistently depicted \u2018Eastern societies\u2019 as exotic and racialized, perpetuating a biased portrayal of the Orient or East. In his seminal text Orientalism (1979), Edward Said, a Palestinian critic, asserts that \u201cEuropean culture gained in strength and identity by setting itself off against the Orient as a sort of surrogate and even underground self.\u201d (3) This dichotomy between the West and the East often presents the West as a modern, flowing territory and the East as a static, archaic region. Therefore, the Orient functions as a mirror to the West in that the West relies heavily on its counterpart, the Orient, for its own sense of superiority. (Sandy and Ouardi, 2019, p. 129) On the other hand, this discourse of exoticism, essentialism, and stereotyping of the East and its people has been used to justify colonization, exploitation, and violence against Eastern civilizations.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Eurocentrism: Hegemonic Dualism and Subaltern Marginalization\n\nEurocentrism is an ethnocentric epistemology prioritizing European culture, history, and values as the locus of global significance while diminishing non-European contributions.

These anonymous characters embark on a journey through which they seek to influence public opinion, challenge the status quo, and question authority through their online writings. Of these, Demosthenes emerges as a figure bearing significant parallels to today's society, serving as a cautionary tale on the dangers of demagoguery, the power of the media, and the consequences of unchecked nationalism.\n\nDemagoguery and Its Perils\n\nIn Card's novel, Demosthenes emerges as a poster child for demagoguery. He skillfully taps into the public's fears and uncertainties by preaching xenophobia, advocating for a strong defense against the \"buggers,\" and critiquing political entities in power. Demosthenes' messages are often simplistic and focused on evoking intense emotional responses rather than promoting reasoned debate. \n\nThis pattern of political discourse is all too familiar in today's society. Demagogues have risen to positions of power throughout human history. Today, some are quick to stoke the fires of fear and resentment, rallying support around overly simplistic solutions that often fail to deliver tangible outcomes. The rise of populism across various parts of the globe has signaled a retreat to nationalism and a push for exclusionary policies. Demosthenes serves as a stark reminder that societies must approach demagoguery with skepticism, resisting the urge to be swayed by emotional appeals devoid of reason or compassion.\n\nThe Power of the Media\n\nThe Internet plays a pivotal role in Ender's Game, as it does in our own lives today. Peter and Valentine \u2013 as Locke and Demosthenes \u2013 dominate the virtual world and master the art of manipulating public opinion. In this fictional universe, the power of words and ideas disseminated through the electronic media proves awe-inspiring, a power that has grown exponentially in our own reality.\n\nThe parallels between the novel's virtual world and today's social media landscape are uncanny. The digital age has expanded the reach and swiftness of public discourse, making it susceptible to manipulation by skillful actors. The spread of fake news and the rise of echo chambers have exacerbated divisions in society, eroding trust in institutions and leaving the public ever more vulnerable to the tactics of demagogues. Demosthenes' ascent in Ender's Game highlights the importance of vigilance and critical thinking in today's age of information deluge.\n\nThe Consequences of Unchecked Nationalism\n\nThroughout his writings, Demosthenes preaches a hardline nationalism, a passion that finds fertile ground in a society scarred by fear and the prospect of an alien invasion. This sentiment resonates with the people, propelling Demosthenes into a position of immense influence. \n\nThis relentless pursuit of nationalism in the novel serves as a cautionary tale for our own society. In recent years, we have witnessed a resurgence of nationalist sentiments, with political actors harnessing such emotions to advance their own agendas. However, unchecked nationalism often carries with it a risk of exclusion, discrimination, and potentially even violence. By drawing parallels with Demosthenes, Card's novel urges societies to recognize the potential harm of embracing nationalism without sufficiently accounting for the moral and social implications it might entail.\n\nConclusion\n\nEnder's Game may be set in a fictional future, but the figure of Demosthenes holds significant relevance for our own society. Demosthenes represents a chilling cautionary tale, offering insight into the dangers of demagoguery, the power of the media, and the consequences of unchecked nationalism. As we navigate our own uncertain times, it is vital to remember the lessons from this iconic figure: to approach demagoguery with skepticism, to critically engage with and scrutinize the information we consume, and to carefully consider the implications of the ideologies we choose to embrace."}]}, {"facetValue": "analyze a conversation and identify the specific requests made regarding machine learning models and software.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "understand the downsides of the BERT machine learning model and seek an opinion on the quality of the Tilesetter software."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "analyze a conversation and identify the specific requests made regarding machine learning models and software."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the downside of the BERT machine learning model ?\nAlso, is the \"Tilesetter\" software a good one ?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Downsides of the BERT machine learning model:\n\n1.

Sie wird auch oft als 'Queen of Crime' bezeichnet und ihre Krimiromane haben eine immens beliebte Fangemeinde auf der ganzen Welt. Mit mehr als 80 Romanen, Kurzgeschichten und Theatertexten, die in mehr als 50 Sprachen \u00fcbersetzt wurden, hat sie sich als eine der produktivsten Schriftstellerinnen des 20. Jahrhunderts etabliert. Aber was ist das Geheimnis ihres Schreibstils und warum hat sie so viele Fans?\n\nAgatha Christies Schreibstil ist bekannt f\u00fcr seine Komplexit\u00e4t und Detailtiefe. Sie hat w\u00e4hrend ihrer Karriere eine Vielzahl von technischen Aspekten des Schreibens angewendet, um ihre Charaktere und ihre Geschichten auf unterschiedlichste Weise zu pr\u00e4sentieren. Ein bekanntes Merkmal ihres Schreibstils ist die Verwendung von Schwerkraft - das bedeutet, dass sie den Leser dazu bringen wollte, die Geschichte so aufmerksam zu lesen, dass sich der Leser ein Bild von der L\u00f6sung des Falls machen konnte, bevor der Detektiv in der Geschichte es tat. Das ist ein technisches Man\u00f6ver, das normalerweise funktioniert, da es den Leser dazu zwingt, die Handlung zu verfolgen und die Hinweise auf die wahre Natur des Falles zu suchen. Dies verbindet die Leserdinglichkeit und emotional mit den Charakteren und schafft eine hochwertige Lekt\u00fcreerfahrung.\n\nAgatha Christies Schreibstil ist auch bekannt f\u00fcr seine schn\u00f6rkellose und pr\u00e4zise Sprache. Sie vermeidet es oft, ausschweifende Beschreibungen von Charakteren, Pl\u00e4tzen oder Szenen zu verwenden, und statt dessen legt sie Wert auf die K\u00fcrze und Klarheit von Informationen in der Handlung. Dies erm\u00f6glicht es ihr, den Leser konzentriert auf die Handlung zu halten, w\u00e4hrend er sich darauf konzentriert, die Hinweise zusammenzuf\u00fchren und die L\u00f6sung des Falls zu suchen.\n\nEin anderer wichtiger Aspekt von Agatha Christies Schreibstil ist ihre F\u00e4higkeit, unterschiedliche Charaktere und Perspektiven einzufangen. Sie verwendet verschiedene Methoden, um Farbe und Tiefe in die Charaktere und ihre Geschichten zu bringen. Sie schickt ihre Charaktere durch ein Labyrinth von menschlichen Emotionen und Beziehungen, in dem sie oft mit fr\u00fcheren Verfehlungen konfrontiert werden. Diese Konfrontationen f\u00fchren oft zu entscheidenden Momenten in der Geschichte, in denen der Leser etwas erfahren kann, das zum Verst\u00e4ndnis und zur L\u00f6sung des R\u00e4tsels beitr\u00e4gt. Agatha Christie nutzt auch ihre F\u00e4higkeit, verschiedene Perspektiven und Standpunkte einzubeziehen, um die Figuren in ihren Geschichten in ein breiteres soziales Umfeld zu erweitern, was dazu beitr\u00e4gt, das Mysterium und den Neidfaktor der Geschichte zu vergr\u00f6\u00dfern.\n\nEin weiteres wichtiges Merkmal von Agatha Christies Schreibstil ist ihre F\u00e4higkeit, das Genre des Kriminalromans zu erweitern. Die meisten ihrer Werke sind tats\u00e4chlich mehr als einfache Detektivgeschichten. Sie integriert oft spezielle Aspekte des menschlichen Verhaltens und der Psychologie in ihre Geschichten und nutzt diese Merkmale, um den Leser tief in die Handlung zu ziehen. Sie sorgte auch daf\u00fcr, dass ihre Charaktere nicht an die in Kriminalliteratur und Filmen \u00fcblichen Klischees gebunden waren. Sie verstand, dass die Charaktere in ihren Geschichten komplex und vielschichtig sein mussten, um den Leser hinzuhalten und seinen Interesse aufrechtzuerhalten. Dies verleiht ihren Geschichten ein besonderes Ma\u00df an Authentizit\u00e4t und Glaubw\u00fcrdigkeit, was dazu beitr\u00e4gt, dass sich der Leser emotional zu den Charakteren hingezogen f\u00fchlt.\n\nSchlie\u00dflich war Agatha Christie auch bekannt f\u00fcr ihre F\u00e4higkeit, ihre Leser zu \u00fcberraschen. Sie legte immer wieder falsche F\u00e4hrten und f\u00fchrte ihre Leser oft auf die falsche F\u00e4hrte in Bezug auf die Identit\u00e4t des T\u00e4ters oder die L\u00f6sung des Falles. Dies ist eines der Markenzeichen ihres Schreibstils und trug auch erheblich zu ihrer Beliebtheit und Legendenbildung bei.\n\nWie man sehen kann, ist Agatha Christies Schreibstil komplex und vielf\u00e4ltig. Sie verwendete eine Vielzahl von Techniken, um ihre Geschichten und Charaktere m\u00f6glichst genau aufzustellen und ihre Leser in ihren Bann zu ziehen. Ihre F\u00e4higkeit, das Genre des Kriminalromans zu erweitern und ihren Lesern ein authentisches Erlebnis zu bieten, hat dazu beigetragen, ihre Geschichten zeitlos zu machen und sie bis heute f\u00fcr Liebhaber des Genres interessant zu halten.\n\nInsgesamt bleibt Agatha Christie eine Ikone der Literatur, die aus gutem Grund so viele Fans hat. Ihre B\u00fccher sind f\u00fcr jeden Liebhaber des Kriminalgenres ein Muss und ihr Einfluss l\u00e4sst sich in vielen modernen Kriminalgeschichten und Fernsehserien immer noch sp\u00fcren.
