In the \"Settings\" panel, click on \"Company Settings\" located on the left side menu.\n4. Click on \"Email\" under \"Connections\" to get to the email settings page.\n5. Click on \"Add Connection\" and fill out the information for the email account you want to connect, such as your email address, password, IMAP/SMTP details, and other necessary details. Please note that you'll need to contact your email service provider to gather this information if you don't have it.\n6. Once you have entered the correct information, click on \"Connect\" to establish the connection.\n\nIn order to forward GoHighLevel emails to your agents' inboxes, you'll need to create an automation:\n\n1. Go to \"Campaigns\" in the main menu.\n2. Click on \"New Campaign\" to create a new campaign.\n3. Name your campaign and fill out the necessary information, then click \"Create Campaign.\"\n4. Inside the campaign builder, click on \"Add Trigger\" and choose the trigger that fits your needs, such as \"New Lead Created\" or any other event that will initiate the email being sent.\n5. Once the trigger is set, click on \"Add Action\" and choose the \"Send Email\" action.\n6. You can choose to send the email from the connected email address in the \"From\" field.\n7. In the \u201cTo\u201d field, type in your email address and your agents' email addresses; separate multiple email addresses with a comma (e.g., you@example.com, agent1@example.com, agent2@example.com).\n8. Fill out the \"Subject\" and \"Body\" fields according to the information you want to include in the email you'll receive. You can use tags, images, and HTML formatting to personalize the email.\n9. Click on \"Save\" to save the email action within the campaign.\n10. After you have created the automation, every time the selected trigger occurs, an email notification will be sent to you and your agents' inboxes.\n\nKeep in mind that these instructions will only enable you to receive emails from the GoHighLevel platform.

I got sidetracked, but I now know how to build an app, and I have an idea for one - using chat GPT to create customized bedtime stories for V. She can choose the characters, genre, and setting, and chat GPT will generate a story since it's particularly good at that. I have a prompt that helps me write the code, which I got chat GPT to improve. By piecing together everything from the videos I've been watching this past week, I think I can do this. I used a free version of chat GPT 3.5 for this, which is pretty legit but limited in customization. I now have a reason to buy the legit version for GPT 4 to help me write the code and integrate it into the app with the API key, and then spend $25 to get a Google Play Console account to publish it on the app store. I think it's doable, and the idea itself isn't too complicated - it's like using chat GPT to create a kids' story about a bear in San Quintin who is searching for ice cream with V's help. Actually... you can do that now... I'm simply putting it into an app. I guess everyone is essentially doing the same thing - inserting chat GPT into things and calling it their own AI, but really, it's just chat GPT doing everything.\n\nThe prompt looks good and should work. I just have to think a bit more about how the app would look and how V would interact with it. I was thinking about having options with pictures of the characters' adventures and predetermined settings, and chat GPT would generate a different and original story each time, regardless of whether the selections were the same. I figured that would be easier to code than typing it out for her, and she could choose it herself. Maybe there could be a section where the parent could go in and change the characters' settings and adventure type by typing in different ones? It's just a matter of describing it to the AI \u2014 a button for characters would give you pictures of a bear, a zombie, a pony, etc. for the main character, along with a picture designating the adventure type, etc. Then, GPT would recognize that and create a fun, creative story about the chosen character in a blank setting. All of this could run in the background, and V would only see three dots, after which the story would start generating, and it would have to be read to her since it would be easier than integrating something to read it out loud, like Google Assistant.\n\nOkay, maybe I haven't fleshed out the app idea enough; I jumped the gun, as per usual.

Damn, okay, so maybe I'm not quite there yet, but it's starting to sound unique again. You open the app, and a rainbow appears across the screen displaying, \"It's Story Time!\" It then takes you to the main page \"\u00bfQu\u00e9 tipo de historia quieres?\" where you have adventure selections; (what kinds? Ask V). Once you select this, you will be asked to choose the characters. Should there be an option for conflict? Does it need to have a plot? Or does the user choose the setting, and chat GPT would take these inputs and insert them in designated slots within a predetermined prompt that says, \"Create a creative kids story about (kid's character selection)\" - the same for the adventure type (and setting). Create a simple, entertaining plot for a 5-year-old with a happy ending. Okay, this needs a lot of work. I need to imagine and describe what the app would look like and how it would function.

In this example, we'll use the OpenAI Python library to interact with the OpenAI API. You can modify this outline to add more features and functionality as needed.\n\n1. Set up your environment:\n\n- Make sure Python 3.x is installed.\n- Create a virtual environment to separate your application dependencies from the system.\n- Install the required packages (flask, openai, etc.) in your virtual environment.\n\n2. Get your OpenAI API key:\n\n- Sign up on the OpenAI platform (https://beta.openai.com/signup) if you haven't already.\n- Obtain your API key from the OpenAI platform.\n\n3. Create the application structure:\n\n- Create a folder for your application.\n- Within the folder, create the following files: app.py, templates/, and static/ (for CSS, JS, etc.).\n\n4. Install required libraries:\n\nFor this application, we need the following Python libraries, which can be installed using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install Flask\npip install openai\n```\n\n5. Create a Flask application (app.py):\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template, request\nimport openai\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n# Set up your API key\nopenai.api_key = \"your_openai_api_key\"\n\n# Home route\n@app.route('/')\ndef index():\n    return render_template('index.html')\n\n# Process user input and generate model's response\n@app.route('/process', methods=['POST'])\ndef process():\n    user_input = request.form['user-input']\n    response = get_gpt3_5_response(user_input)\n    return {'response': response}\n\n# Communicate with OpenAI API\ndef get_gpt3_5_response(prompt):\n    model_engine = \"text-davinci-002\"\n\n    response = openai.Completion.create(\n        engine=model_engine,\n        prompt=prompt,\n        max_tokens=150,\n        n=1,\n        stop=None,\n        temperature=0.5\n    )\n\n    return response.choices[0].text.strip()\n\n# Run the Flask application\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n6. Design the chat interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the templates and static folders. A simple example of templates/index.html:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Goal Achievement Chatbot</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div id=\"chat\">\n        <div id=\"messages\">\n            <!-- Add chat messages here -->\n        </div>\n        <form id=\"input-form\" onsubmit=\"return sendMessage();\">\n            <input type=\"text\" id=\"user-input\" placeholder=\"Type your message...\">\n            <button type=\"submit\">Send</button>\n        </form>\n    </div>\n    <script>\n        // (Add your JavaScript code here to handle sending and receiving messages)\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n7. Run the application:\n\n```bash\npython app.py\n```\n\nYour application should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Users can enter their goals, and the chatbot will provide guidance on achieving those goals using GPT-3.5.\n\nRemember to replace \"your_openai_api_key\" with your own API key. You can also customize the setup by changing the model_engine, prompt, and other options in the 'get_gpt3_5_response' function.

The following guide demonstrates how to achieve this using Python, OpenAI's GPT-4 (or GPT-3.5) model, and various helpful libraries.\n\n## Step 1: Set up the environment\n\nEnsure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Also, ensure that `pip` (package installer for Python) is installed.\n\n## Step 2: Install necessary libraries\n\nTo build this application, you'll need several libraries, which can be installed through `pip`. Open up terminal or command prompt, and install these libraries:\n\n```bash\npip install openai\npip install Flask\npip install Flask-SocketIO\n```\n\n## Step 3: Get your API key from OpenAI\n\nVisit the OpenAI platform to get access to GPT-4 (or GPT-3.5). Sign up or log in to your account, get the necessary API key, and read the official [OpenAI API documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction).\n\n## Step 4: Create a helper function to interact with GPT-4\n\nCreate a new Python file called `gpt_helper.py`, and add the following code:\n\n```python\nimport openai\nimport os\n\nopenai.api_key = \"your_api_key_here\"\n\ndef generate_answer(prompt):\n    response = openai.Completion.create(\n        engine=\"text-davinci-002\", # Use \"text-davinci-002\" for GPT-3.5, otherwise, use the corresponding engine for GPT-4.\n        prompt=prompt,\n        max_tokens=150,\n        n=1,\n        stop=None,\n        temperature=0.5,\n    )\n    answer = response.choices[0].text.strip()\n    return answer\n```\n\nReplace `your_api_key_here` with your OpenAI API key.\n\n## Step 5: Set up Flask\n\nCreate a new Python file called `app.py`, and set up the Flask application:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template\nfrom flask_socketio import SocketIO, send, emit\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your_secret_key_here'\nsocketio = SocketIO(app)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef index():\n    return render_template('index.html')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    socketio.run(app)\n```\n\nReplace `your_secret_key_here` with your own secret key.\n\n## Step 6: Design a simple chat UI\n\nCreate a new folder called `templates` in the same directory as `app.py`, and create a new HTML file called `index.html` inside the templates folder:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Goal Achievement Chatbot</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/css/bootstrap.min.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row\">\n            <div class=\"col-12\">\n                <h2 class=\"text-center my-4\">Goal Achievement Chatbot</h2>\n                <div id=\"chat_area\" class=\"border p-3\" style=\"height:400px; overflow-y: auto;\">\n                </div>\n                <form id=\"chat_form\" class=\"mt-4\">\n                    <input id=\"message\" type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" placeholder=\"Type your message...\">\n                </form>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/2.3.0/socket.io.js\"></script>\n    <script>\n        const socket = io.connect('http://' + document.domain + ':' + location.port);\n        const chat_form = $('#chat_form');\n        const chat_area = $('#chat_area');\n        \n        chat_form.submit((e) => {\n            e.preventDefault();\n            const message = chat_form.find('input').val();\n            chat_area.append(`<p><strong>You:</strong> ${message}</p>`);\n            chat_form[0].reset();\n            socket.emit('submit_message', {'message': message});\n        });\n\n        socket.on('response_message', (data) => {\n            const response = data['response'];\n            chat_area.append(`<p><strong>Bot:</strong> ${response}</p>`);\n            chat_area.scrollTop(chat_area[0].scrollHeight);\n        });\n    </script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Step 7: Integrate the chatbot\n\nAdd the following code to `app.py` to establish communication between the user and the GPT-4 (or GPT-3.5) chatbot.\n\n```python\nfrom gpt_helper import generate_answer\n\n@socketio.on('submit_message')\ndef handleMessage(data):\n    message = data['message']\n    response = generate_answer(message)\n    emit('response_message', {'response': response}, broadcast=True)\n```\n\n## Step 8: Test the application\n\nRun the `app.py` with the following command on your terminal or command prompt:\n\n```bash\npython app.py\n```\n\nOpen your web browser and visit `http://localhost:5000/`, where you can interact with the chatbot to help you achieve your goals.\n\nRemember, this is a basic example, and you can further enhance this application by adding authentication, storing user goals, tracking progress, and customizing the chatbot experience."}, {"role": "user", "content": "crea un codigo en python que permita proporcionar retroalimentaci\u00f3n sobre la eficacia del chatgpt 3.5 para lograr sus objetivos.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Puedes crear un sistema de clasificaci\u00f3n y retroalimentaci\u00f3n que permita a los usuarios proporcionar comentarios sobre la eficacia del chatbot GPT-3.5 para lograr sus objetivos. A continuaci\u00f3n se muestra un ejemplo de c\u00f3mo puedes hacer esto en Python y Flask.\n\n### Paso 1: Agregar un formulario de retroalimentaci\u00f3n al HTML\n\nAgrega un formulario de retroalimentaci\u00f3n al `index.html` dentro del directorio `templates`, bajo el formulario de chat existente:\n\n```html\n<form id=\"feedback_form\" class=\"mt-2\">\n    <label for=\"rating\">Rate the response (1-5): </label>\n    <select id=\"rating\" class=\"custom-select custom-select-sm\" style=\"width: 60px;\">\n        <option>1</option>\n        <option>2</option>\n        <option>3</option>\n        <option>4</option>\n        <option>5</option>\n    </select>\n    <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-sm btn-primary\">Submit</button>\n</form>\n```\n\n### Paso 2: Crear una funci\u00f3n para manejar la retroalimentaci\u00f3n\n\nCrea una nueva funci\u00f3n en `app.py` para procesar y almacenar la retroalimentaci\u00f3n recibida. En este ejemplo, simplemente imprimir\u00e1 la clasificaci\u00f3n. Sin embargo, podr\u00edas mejorar este proceso almacenando la retroalimentaci\u00f3n en una base de datos para su posterior an\u00e1lisis.\n\n```python\n@socketio.on('submit_feedback')\ndef handle_feedback(data):\n    rating = data['rating']\n    print(f\"Received feedback: {rating}/5\")\n```\n\n### Paso 3: Agregar eventos para manejar la sumisi\u00f3n del formulario de retroalimentaci\u00f3n\n\nModifica el archivo `index.html` para manejar la sumisi\u00f3n del formulario de retroalimentaci\u00f3n, enviando los datos al servidor:\n\n```javascript\nconst feedback_form = $('#feedback_form');\n\nfeedback_form.submit((e) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    const rating = feedback_form.find('select').val();\n    socket.emit('submit_feedback', {'rating': rating});\n    feedback_form[0].reset();\n});\n```\n\n### Paso 4: Probar la aplicaci\u00f3n\n\nEjecuta la aplicaci\u00f3n como se detalla en el ejemplo anterior y env\u00eda mensajes a trav\u00e9s del chatbot. Luego, proporciona una clasificaci\u00f3n utilizando el formulario de retroalimentaci\u00f3n. Como resultado, deber\u00edas ver las clasificaciones impresas en la terminal o en el s\u00edmbolo del sistema donde se ejecuta la aplicaci\u00f3n.\n\nRecuerda que este es un ejemplo b\u00e1sico, podr\u00edas mejorar m\u00e1s la aplicaci\u00f3n integrando un sistema de base de datos para almacenar las clasificaciones y realizar un seguimiento a las mejoras en el rendimiento del chatbot para

released. However, you can follow these steps to use Wolfram Alpha with existing OpenAI models like GPT-3:\n\n1. Register and get the Wolfram Alpha API key: Sign up for an account on the Wolfram Alpha developer portal (https://developer.wolframalpha.com/). After registering, create a new App and obtain an App ID (API key).\n\n2. Install the Wolfram Alpha Python library: Use Python to integrate the Wolfram Alpha API. You can install the library via pip:\n```bash\npip install wolframalpha\n```\n\n3. Connect to the Wolfram Alpha API: Import the library and connect to the Wolfram Alpha API using your API key:\n```python\nimport wolframalpha\n\nAPI_KEY = 'your_app_id_here'\nclient = wolframalpha.Client(API_KEY)\n```\n\n4. Write a function to query Wolfram Alpha:\n```python\ndef query_wolfram_alpha(query):\n    res = client.query(query)\n    try:\n        return next(res.results).text\n    except StopIteration:\n        return \"No result found.\"\n```\n\n5. Integrate the Wolfram Alpha function with your GPT-3 chatbot. When using OpenAI's GPT-3, you may include a function call to `query_wolfram_alpha()` whenever you'd like to access Wolfram Alpha's computation capabilities.\n\nThe installation of the Wolfram Alpha plugin (API integration) will help you obtain quick answers and calculation results while using the chatbot. This can expand the chatbot's functionality, making it more useful for answering complex math problems, factual questions, or analyzing data."}]}, {"facetValue": "understand and respond to the user's query about the meaning of Chatbot GPT.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "understand and respond to natural language questions or tasks involving chat generation."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "Chinese"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "understand and respond to the user's query about the meaning of Chatbot GPT."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bf4\u4e2d\u6587\u5417"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u662f\u7684\uff0c\u6211\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bf4\u4e2d\u6587\u3002\u8bf7\u95ee\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u6211\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u60a8\u7684\u5417\uff1f"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u4e00\u4e0bchat gpt\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u542b\u4e49\u5417"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u5f53\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u3002Chatbot GPT\uff08Generative Pre-trained Transformer\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eGPT\u6280\u672f\u7684\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u5206\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u672f\u8bed\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u5b83\u7684\u542b\u4e49\uff1a\n\n1. \u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff08Chatbot\uff09\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f7f\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08AI\uff09\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u6d41\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u7528\u6237\u7684\u63d0\u95ee\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u3002\n\n2.

Reconstruction Efforts: As players progress through the floors, they will encounter floors with damages caused by previous players or in-game events. Players must work together to repair and rebuild these floors, combining their skills and resources. GPT-4 will generate unique repair quests and challenges specific to the theme of the damaged floor. Successful completion of these quests will restore the floor's resources and unlock new experiences tailored to the floor's theme.\n\n1.2. Floor Master Battles: On each floor, a floor master awaits the players, challenging them to battles or tests of might and skill. GPT-4 generates floor masters with unique abilities, strategies, combat styles, and movement patterns based on the theme of the floor. Players have to work together and utilize their VR environment to their advantage to defeat the floor masters and gain access to the next floor.\n\n1.3. Floor Creation Contest: As new floors are being developed, players can participate in a collaborative contest that allows them to propose and vote on the themes for future floors. GPT-4 can provide prompts or suggestions based on the current floors' themes and narrative context. Players can contribute their ideas, designs, or even create content such as objects, items, or enemies for the new floors. The winning entries will be incorporated into the MMO world, and their creators will be rewarded.\n\n2. Dynamic World Activities:\n\n2.1. Discovery Expeditions: Players organize expeditions to explore undiscovered areas on each floor or even find secret pathways to hidden floors. Through the use of VR and GPT-4 generated environmental puzzles, players have to navigate through treacherous terrain and solve intricate puzzles to discover new locations, resources, or hidden lore.\n\n2.2. Spatial Mastery: As the game is in VR, the AI can create quests that require a player to use their spatial awareness and physical movements to solve challenges. Each floor will have multiple challenges that require players to interact with the VR environment in unique ways, such as climbing structures, navigating narrow passageways, or manipulating objects with precision.\n\n2.3. VR Performance Competitions: Floors are designed with VR-specific entertainment and sports in mind. Players can participate in virtual music and dance events, gladiatorial combat arenas, or racing circuits that take full advantage of the VR environment. GPT-4 can dynamically generate new event types, songs, and choreographies for players to enjoy and compete against each other.\n\n3. NPC Interactions:\n\n3.1. Floor-Specific NPCs: GPT-4 can generate floor-specific NPCs with unique personalities, appearances, and professions related to their respective floor themes. Players can interact with these NPCs using VR gestures and body language to communicate, barter, or learn about the lore and history of the floor.\n\n3.2. VR Mini-Games with NPCs: NPCs on each floor could run various mini-games that require players to use their VR capabilities to participate. These mini-games include carnival games, physical challenges, or even memory games, where players have to rely on their senses and coordination within the VR environment.\n\n3.3. Tactical Instructors: To help players master the VR environment, GPT-4 generates tactical instructors that provide immersive tutorials and training sessions for players.

Three different types of duals should occur; total death meaning you lose all your stuff to the other player, forfeiting item meaning the player can choose which items they wager in the fight, and peaceful being just for fun"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Title: VRMMORPG Combat System Concept\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn this VRMMORPG combat system, players have access to a wide array of weapons, abilities, and strategies, allowing a high degree of customization and adaptability. The game features a class-based system with unique abilities, along with rare perks obtained through completing special quests. The PvP system offers three types of duels: total death, forfeiting items, and peaceful. The following is an exploration of this combat system's integration into a VR environment.\n\n1. Classes and Abilities\n\n1.1. Warrior: Warriors excel in close combat, wielding an arsenal of melee weapons like swords, axes, and maces. They have access to abilities such as increased damage output, rallying buffs for their teammates, and powerful stun moves.\n\n1.2. Ranger: Rangers specialize in long-range combat using bows and crossbows. Their abilities include increased accuracy, quicker movement to dodge attacks, and the ability to lay traps for enemies.\n\n1.3. Mage: Mages wield elemental magic to deal massive AoE damage, heal allies, or control the battlefield with crowd control spells. Abilities include spellcasting mastery, improved mana regeneration, and spell augmentation.\n\n1.4. Rogue: Rogues rely on stealth, agility, and cunning to defeat their enemies. Their abilities include backstab for bonus damage, pickpocketing, disarming traps, and evasive maneuvering.\n\n1.5. Paladin: Paladins combine melee combat with divine magic to smite enemies and protect their allies. Their abilities include powerful healing spells, auras that provide team-wide buffs, and the ability to reinforce their weapon with divine energy.\n\n2. Rare Perks from Quests\n\n2.1. Elemental Infusion: Upon completion of a specific quest, the player gains the ability to infuse their weapon with a selected element like fire, ice, or lightning.\n\n2.2. Colossal Strength: Through a series of challenging quests, the player unlocks the ability to temporarily increase their strength and deal massive damage in a short window of time.\n\n2.3. Telekinetic Barrier: After completing a special mage-based quest, players can create a temporary telekinetic force field around themselves or teammates to protect from enemy attacks.\n\n2.4. Shadow Sprint: This rare perk, granted by a rogue-oriented quest, allows the player to turn into a shadowy form and move quickly between hiding spots or gain a sudden burst of speed in combat.\n\n2.5. Divine Intervention: As a reward from a paladin-focused questline, the player gains the ability to call upon a divine power to protect themselves or allies from harm in dire situations.\n\n3. VR Combat Integration\n\n3.1. Players use VR controllers to physically perform combat actions, such as swinging a sword, aiming a bow, or casting a spell. Advanced motion-tracking technology captures the players' movements to translate them into in-game actions.\n\n3.2. Players can engage in combat formations and tactics, coordinating with teammates and responding to verbal or visual cues from other players. Spatial awareness and communication are crucial in VR combat situations.\n\n3.3. Haptic feedback technology enhances immersion, allowing players to feel the impact of their weapon strikes, the pressure of a bowstring, or the sensation of casting a spell.\n\n4. PvP Duels\n\n4.1. Total Death: Players engage in a high-stakes battle to the death, with the winner claiming all the loser's possessions. Before engaging in a total death duel, both players must explicitly agree to the terms.\n\n4.2. Forfeiting Items: Players wager a selected number of items, with the winner taking the chosen items from the loser. Both players must agree on the terms and the items being wagered before the duel begins.\n\n4.3. Peaceful: Players can challenge each other to friendly sparring matches with no severe consequences, allowing them to test their skills, experiment with strategies or abilities, and enjoy the thrill of battle without the risk of losing valuable items or resources."}]}, {"facetValue": "provide help with understanding and translating the prompts related to the Auto-GPT project and related technologies.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "understand and translate a Chinese error message in Java, learn how to filter a list using Java streams, and get guidance for setting up an environment to run the Auto-GPT application."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "provide help with understanding and translating the prompts related to the Auto-GPT project and related technologies."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "3"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "java.io.IOException: \u65ad\u5f00\u7684\u7ba1\u9053  \u8fd9\u79cd\u62a5\u9519\u901a\u5e38\u7531\u4ec0\u4e48\u95ee\u9898\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\uff1f"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u9519\u8bef\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u8fde\u63a5\u4e2d\u65ad\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u6545\u969c\u6216\u63a5\u6536\u65b9\u5173\u95ed\u4e86\u8fde\u63a5\u7b49\u539f\u56e0\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u3002\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u4fe1\u65f6\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u5408\u7406\u5730\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u5e38\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u5065\u58ee\u6027\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u7f51\u7edc\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u548c\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u91cd\u8bd5\u3001\u66f4\u6362\u7f51\u7edc\u6216\u63d0\u793a\u7528\u6237\u68c0\u67e5\u7f51\u7edc\u7b49\u3002"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\u6211\u6709\u4e00\u4e2aList<CpInfoDTO> cpInfoDTOList\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7stream\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6389\u5176\u4e2d\u67d0\u4e2acpName==\"kee\"\u7684item\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1a\n\n```\ncpInfoDTOList = cpInfoDTOList.stream()\n                             .filter(cp -> !\"kee\".equals(cp.getCpName()))\n                             .collect(Collectors.toList());\n```\n\n\u5176\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528`stream()`\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06List\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aStream\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528`filter()`\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u5c06cpName\u4e0d\u7b49\u4e8e\"kee\"\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0b\u6765\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7528`collect()`\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06Stream\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aList\u3002"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\u51e4\u51f0\u7684\u82f1\u6587\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u51e4\u51f0\u7684\u82f1\u6587\u662f\"Phoenix\"\u3002"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\u5047\u8bbe\u6211\u4e0d\u7406\u89e3\u82f1\u8bed\uff0c\u6211\u5c06\u544a\u8bc9\u4f60\u4e00\u4efd\u82f1\u6587\u7684Readme\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u8bf7\u534f\u52a9\u6211\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u5b83\u3002Auto-GPT: An Autonomous GPT-4 Experiment\nGitHub Repo stars Twitter Follow Discord Follow Unit Tests\n\nAuto-GPT is an experimental open-source application showcasing the capabilities of the GPT-4 language model.

You can choose to search the entire web or specific sites.\nOnce you've created your search engine, click on \"Control Panel\" and then \"Basics\". Copy the \"Search engine ID\" and set it as an environment variable named CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID on your machine. See setting up environment variables below.\nRemember that your free daily custom search quota allows only up to 100 searches. To increase this limit, you need to assign a billing account to the project to profit from up to 10K daily searches.\n\nSetting up environment variables\nFor Windows Users:\n\nsetx GOOGLE_API_KEY \"YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY\"\nsetx CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID \"YOUR_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID\"\n\nFor macOS and Linux users:\n\nexport GOOGLE_API_KEY=\"YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY\"\nexport CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=\"YOUR_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID\"\n\nRedis Setup\nInstall docker desktop.\n\nRun:\n\ndocker run -d --name redis-stack-server -p 6379:6379 redis/redis-stack-server:latest\nSee https://hub.docker.com/r/redis/redis-stack-server for setting a password and additional configuration.\n\nSet the following environment variables:\n\nMEMORY_BACKEND=redis\nREDIS_HOST=localhost\nREDIS_PORT=6379\nREDIS_PASSWORD=\nNote that this is not intended to be run facing the internet and is not secure, do not expose redis to the internet without a password or at all really.\n\nYou can optionally set\n\nWIPE_REDIS_ON_START=False\nTo persist memory stored in Redis.\n\nYou can specify the memory index for redis using the following:\n\nMEMORY_INDEX=whatever\n?? Pinecone API Key Setup\nPinecone enables the storage of vast amounts of vector-based memory, allowing for only relevant memories to be loaded for the agent at any given time.\n\nGo to pinecone and make an account if you don't already have one.\nChoose the Starter plan to avoid being charged.\nFind your API key and region under the default project in the left sidebar.\nSetting up environment variables\nSimply set them in the .env file.\n\nAlternatively, you can set them from the command line (advanced):\n\nFor Windows Users:\n\nsetx PINECONE_API_KEY \"YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY\"\nsetx PINECONE_ENV \"Your pinecone region\" # something like: us-east4-gcp\n\nFor macOS and Linux users:\n\nexport PINECONE_API_KEY=\"YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY\"\nexport PINECONE_ENV=\"Your pinecone region\" # something like: us-east4-gcp\n\nSetting Your Cache Type\nBy default Auto-GPT is going to use LocalCache instead of redis or Pinecone.\n\nTo switch to either, change the MEMORY_BACKEND env variable to the value that you want:\n\nlocal (default) uses a local JSON cache file pinecone uses the Pinecone.io account you configured in your ENV settings redis will use the redis cache that you configured\n\nView Memory Usage\nView memory usage by using the --debug flag :)\n?? Continuous Mode \u26a0\ufe0f\nRun the AI without user authorisation, 100% automated. Continuous mode is not recommended. It is potentially dangerous and may cause your AI to run forever or carry out actions you would not usually authorise. Use at your own risk.\n\nRun the main.py Python script in your terminal:\npython scripts/main.py --continuous\n\nTo exit the program, press Ctrl + C\nGPT3.5 ONLY Mode\nIf you don't have access to the GPT4 api, this mode will allow you to use Auto-GPT!\n\npython scripts/main.py --gpt3only\nIt is recommended to use a virtual machine for tasks that require high security measures to prevent any potential harm to the main computer's system and data.\n\n?? Image Generation\nBy default, Auto-GPT uses DALL-e for image generation. To use Stable Diffusion, a HuggingFace API Token is required.\n\nOnce you have a token, set these variables in your .env:\n\nIMAGE_PROVIDER=sd\nHUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=\"YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN\"\n\u26a0\ufe0f Limitations\nThis experiment aims to showcase the potential of GPT-4 but comes with some limitations:\n\nNot a polished application or product, just an experiment\nMay not perform well in complex, real-world business scenarios. In fact, if it actually does, please share your results!\nQuite expensive to run, so set and monitor your API key limits with OpenAI!\n??

rake in that passive income. Credit: Getty Images\n > Tech\nIf GPT-4 put hustle culture on steroids, then Auto-GPT is like those steroids taking steroids.\n\nAuto-GPT(Opens in a new tab) is the latest creation spawned from OpenAI's API that has hustle bros and get-rich-quick schemers in a tizzy. ChatGPT is already commonplace for hustle bros, who worship anything that will optimize efficiency \u2014 with the ultimate goal of making as much money as possible with the least amount of effort. And now Auto-GPT is making their prompt-engineered-heads explode with its capabilities.\n\nTo be clear, Auto-GPT is technically very impressive, and for all we know, the intentions of its creators were pure. But the way opportunists have latched onto it is what makes people leery of AI in the first place. If you're wondering why the crypto bro who became a ChatGPT bro is now tweeting about Auto-GPT, here's why.\n\nSEE ALSO: HustleGPT is a hilarious and scary AI experiment in capitalism \nWhat is Auto-GPT\nAuto-GPT is an open-source application, created by developer Toran Bruce Richards. It uses OpenAI's large language model, GPT-4, to automate the execution of multi-step projects that would have required back-and-forth prompting if you worked directly with GPT-4. In other words, it \"chains together LLM 'thoughts', to autonomously achieve whatever goal you set,\" according to the GitHub repo page. Auto-GPT was released last week, so it's early days, but Twitter is already giddy over its use cases for some of the time-honored hustle bro strategies, including analyzing stocks(Opens in a new tab), automating product reviews(Opens in a new tab), and creating a podcast(Opens in a new tab).\n\nTweet may have been deleted(opens in a new tab)(Opens in a new tab)\nTweet may have been deleted(opens in a new tab)(Opens in a new tab)\nTweet may have been deleted(opens in a new tab)(Opens in a new tab)\nHow does Auto-GPT work?\nAuto-GPT is publicly available on GitHub. But you need some kind of programming experience to know how use it, since it runs on Python and requires OpenAI and Pinecone API keys. However, theres already at least one similar app, AgentGPT,(Opens in a new tab) that doesn't require coding knowledge.\n\nFor now, users enter prompts directly in terminal. You're asked to describe the name, role, and objectives of your AI and specify up to five goals to achieve that objective.\n\nIn the demo video, \"Entrepreneur-GPT\" is given the role to \"autonomously develop and run businesses with the sole goal of increasing your net worth.\" The goals are to \"increase net worth,\" \"grow Twitter account,\" and \"develop and manage multiple businesses autonomously.\" Like a bloodhound with a scent, the demo of Auto-GPT is unleashed and immediately gets to work. No need to give it the next prompt. Auto-GPT will be ruthlessly and single-mindedly working to make its master the next magnate of affiliate-linked garbage or some other money-making scheme.\n\nWhy are hustle bros excited about Auto-GPT\nThe goal of Auto-GPT is to \"make GPT-4 fully autonomous.\" For people looking to optimize their productivity (a hustle bro tenet), that's a dream come true. ChatGPT was already taking hustle culture to the next level. After it launched, social media was flooded with ChatGPT hustlers flaunting ways \u2014 legitimate or not \u2014 of using the LLM to automate jobs like copywriting, setting up affiliate marketing content, and even making tutorials on Udemy, as The Verge reported(Opens in a new tab).\n\nBut such schemes still required human input to nudge ChatGPT to the next step. With Auto-GPT, you can simply describe what you want your AI to do, outline up to five goals, then kick up your feet and pat yourself on the back for outsmarting the system.\n\nRelated Stories\nUsers who spot bugs in ChatGPT can now make up to $20,000\nChatGPT banned in Italy\nNonprofit files FTC complaint against OpenAI's GPT-4\nOpenAI's GPT-4 aced all of its exams \u2013 except for these\nTweet may have been deleted(opens in a new tab)(Opens in a new tab)\nTweet may have been deleted(opens in a new tab)(Opens in a new tab)\nTweet may have been deleted(opens in a new tab)(Opens in a new tab)\nDoes Auto-GPT live up to the hype?\nLet's put aside the fact that affiliate marketing or freelance copywriting won't make you an overnight billionaire, and focus on the fact that it's a brand new technology that's explicitly described as \"experimental.\" Like GPT-4, anything that's built with it is prone to inaccuracies and hallucinations. When using ChatGPT, you can check it for errors or recalibrate your conversation if the model starts to go off the rails. But with Auto-GPT, you might give it a project, then go to bed, leaving the model unattended for hours (which is the point). By the time you wake up, who knows what could've happened \u2014 especially if you told GPT-4 something like \"make as much money as possible.\"\n\nTweet may have been deleted(opens in a new tab)(Opens in a new tab)\nIt's a classic jumping on the bandwagon situation. Except this bandwagon is perched on top of another bandwagon (ChatGPT) which is a very precarious position indeed. To be fair, claims that Auto-GPT is the \"next big thing\" are somewhat substantiated. OpenAI founding member Andrej Karpathy recently tweeted(Opens in a new tab) his opinion that tools like Auto-GPT would be \"the next frontier of prompt engineering.\" And the automation of ChatGPT tasks undoubtedly has massive potential.\n\nBut for now, we're just annoyed that hustle bros have a shiny new toy at their disposal.\n\nMore in Artificial Intelligence, ChatGPT\n\nMashable Image\nCecily Mauran\nCecily is a tech reporter at Mashable who covers AI, Apple, and emerging tech trends.

My first request is \"I want to write an opinion GPT-5 .\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Title: Why the Development of GPT-5 Demands Critical Consideration and Discussion\n\nAs we stand on the precipice of artificial intelligence truly transforming the way we live, work and communicate, it is essential for society to acknowledge and engage in discourse surrounding the ethical implications and potential impact of these advancements. One such development that demands our collective scrutiny is OpenAI's GPT-3 language model, and the expected emergence of its successor GPT-5. In this opinion piece, I delve into the importance of having a critical conversation and formulating thoughtful strategies to address the challenges and potential consequences posed by powerful AI like GPT-5.\n\nFirstly, let us consider the incredible capabilities of GPT-3, which has already demonstrated impressive language understanding, writing code, creating website designs, and even generating human-like responses in virtual conversations. While the technology has not yet reached perfection, GPT-5 will undoubtedly strive to improve upon its predecessor's shortcomings, like the lack of contextual awareness and potential for malicious use.\n\nThe critical question we must ask ourselves is how to maintain control and responsibility for AI systems as they become increasingly sophisticated and autonomous. Much of this responsibility falls on the shoulders of developers and regulators to collectively implement measures such as better monitoring, content filtering, and minimizing output bias. This is easier said than done, but transparency in AI governance and collaboration across the industry should be prioritized.\n\nMoreover, it is vital to cultivate a public understanding of AI developments like GPT-5. By highlighting its capabilities, potential for misuse, and the ethical boundaries that must be maintained, society can engage in informed discussions and contribute to responsible AI development. OpenAI\u2019s Charter, which emphasizes beneficial use and broad distribution, serves as a good starting point yet should continue to evolve as the conversation progresses.\n\nThe issue of job displacement should also not be overlooked. GPT-5's potential to create content at scale and remarkable accuracy might lead certain professional roles to become obsolete. As technology progresses, it is incumbent upon governments, businesses, and educators to prepare the workforce for future challenges through upskilling and reskilling, STEM education, and promoting the intertwined growth of both human expertise and AI capabilities.\n\nFurthermore, as AI-generated content becomes even more difficult to distinguish from human-generated work, it becomes essential to develop tools and strategies to identify such content. This is not only to maintain intellectual rights and property but also to ensure that users can trust and verify the sources of information they encounter. Striking a balance between AI advancement and content identification will be crucial in maintaining a cohesive digital space.\n\nLastly, the potential for misinformation and disinformation facilitated by advanced AI models should not be ignored. The ability of GPT-5 to generate accurate and coherent content can be a double-edged sword, capable of perpetuating misleading information or propaganda. It is critical that responsible parties, be it governments or companies, take decisive action to prevent the misuse of AI in spreading falsehoods, without inhibiting free speech or access to legitimate, helpful AI tools.\n\nIn conclusion, while the development of GPT-5 promises significant advancements in AI-powered language models and a myriad of potential applications, it also thrusts us into a new era of ethical and societal challenges. We must embrace these challenges, engage in meaningful discussion and collaboration, and address the complex problems that powerful AI systems like GPT-5 introduce. By adopting this proactive mindset, we can ensure that technology benefits mankind without crossing the thresholds of ethical use, responsibility, and public trust."}]}, {"facetValue": "analyze and describe an open-source project, Auto-GPT, which provides a GUI for interacting with the GPT-3 API.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "obtain an analysis of the Auto-GPT project, which provides a GUI for interacting with the GPT-3 API."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "analyze and describe an open-source project, Auto-GPT, which provides a GUI for interacting with the GPT-3 API."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "analiza en profundidad este desarrollo https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Auto-GPT es un proyecto de c\u00f3digo abierto alojado en GitHub que intenta brindar una GUI (interfaz gr\u00e1fica de usuario) amigable y din\u00e1mica a la API de OpenAI, en particular para trabajar con el modelo GPT-3.

El flujo de trabajo esencial en Auto-GPT es establecer la comunicaci\u00f3n con la API de OpenAI y manejar las interacciones con GPT-3 de una manera m\u00e1s intuitiva.\n\nLuego de ejecutar la aplicaci\u00f3n, mediante el comando `streamlit run x.py` donde x.py es uno de los archivos disponibles en el repositorio, el usuario ver\u00e1 una GUI a trav\u00e9s de su navegador donde podr\u00e1 especificar par\u00e1metros como \"Texto de entrada\", \"Temperatura\", \"Token m\u00e1ximo\" y otros ajustes relacionados con su consulta a GPT-3. Luego de proporcionar estos detalles el usuario puede generar la respuesta presionando el bot\u00f3n 'Enviar' y obtendr\u00e1 la respuesta correspondiente de GPT-3.\n\n4. Personalizaci\u00f3n:\n\nEl proyecto depende en gran medida de Streamlit para crear la GUI. Streamlit es una biblioteca ligera y altamente adaptable que utiliza funciones puras de Python. Esto significa que este proyecto puede ser f\u00e1cilmente personalizado en la medida en que lo permite Streamlit.\n\nPara cambiar la apariencia o la funcionalidad de la aplicaci\u00f3n, los usuarios pueden explorar la documentaci\u00f3n oficial de Streamlit: [Streamlit Docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/) y modificar el c\u00f3digo fuente en consecuencia.\n\n5. Beneficios y limitaciones:\n \nBeneficios:\n   - Interacci\u00f3n simple y visual con la API de OpenAI.\n   - Facilita la experimentaci\u00f3n y exploraci\u00f3n de caracter\u00edsticas de GPT-3.\n   - Proyecto modificado para proporcionar una demostraci\u00f3n de la traducci\u00f3n entre idiomas.\n   - Facilita ajustes de f\u00e1cil comprensi\u00f3n para los hiperpar\u00e1metros del modelo GPT-3.\n\nLimitaciones:\n   - La interfaz proporcionada est\u00e1 limitada a las capacidades de Streamlit.\n   - El n\u00famero de opciones de configuraci\u00f3n es limitado en comparaci\u00f3n con las interacciones directas con la API de OpenAI.\n   - Es necesario utilizar una clave API de OpenAI, lo cual puede incurrir en costos, dependiendo del acceso y uso del usuario de GPT-3.\n\nEn resumen, Auto-GPT es un proyecto interesante que facilita a los usuarios menos t\u00e9cnicos interactuar y aprovechar el poder de los modelos GPT-3 de OpenAI utilizando una GUI basada en Streamlit. Ofrece un punto de partida s\u00f3lido para aquellos interesados en experimentar con GPT-3 y aprender a utilizar API de OpenAI mientras proporciona una experiencia m\u00e1s completa al usuario gracias a su personalizaci\u00f3n y ajustes de hiperpar\u00e1metros. Sin embargo, se basa en acceso a la API de OpenAI que puede tener costos adicionales y est\u00e1 limitado en funciones m\u00e1s avanzadas en comparaci\u00f3n con interactuar directamente con la API."}]}, {"facetValue": "provide guidance on accessing and using the Auto-GPT platform.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "understand how to set up and use Auto-GPT without needing to install it locally."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "provide guidance on accessing and using the Auto-GPT platform."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hi There!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!

Here's a high-level overview of required steps:\n\n1. Develop a browser extension: You would first need to create a browser extension for the browser you want to target (e.g., Chrome or Firefox). You'll need to learn the basics of browser extension development, including scripting languages such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.\n\n2. Extract the question and the multiple-choice options: Your extension needs to have JavaScript code that can identify and extract the text of the question and the multiple-choice options available on the Edgenuity platform.\n\n3. Integrate GPT-3.5: You will need to get access to the GPT-3.5 API, such as OpenAI's API. Once you have access, you can make requests to the API with the extracted question and options. GPT-3.5 can analyze the given text and provide an answer recommendation.\n\n4.

Here are some specific elements and examples of tools that could be implemented, listed in order of best value for the lowest effort:\n\n1. Automated Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: GPT/LLMs can be used to identify and flag outliers, missing values, and other data quality issues in the ETL pipeline to improve data quality for analytics and reporting. Additionally, LLMs can help automate the categorization of text data, making it more accessible for analysis.\n\n2. Natural Language Processing for Data Exploration and Analysis: GPT/LLMs can help analyze textual data, such as customer feedback or social media posts, by automatically extracting insights, themes, and sentiments in the text. This would enable more comprehensive analysis and improve the value of data used in reports.\n\n3. Interactive Dashboard Interface: Enhance your power bi dashboard with a GPT/LLM-powered chatbot that can answer queries related to data exploration and visualization in natural language. The chatbot can help users quickly understand data trends, outliers, and other insights without needing to create more custom visualizations.\n\n4. Automated Insights Generation for Reports: Generate insights, trends, and forecasts automatically from the data using GPT/LLMs. These insights can be readily included in PowerPoint presentations as additional information for decision-making.\n\n5. Narration and Storytelling: GPT/LLMs can automatically create a compelling story around the findings from your data analysis, ensuring that PowerPoint presentations effectively communicate the key takeaways in an engaging manner for the target audience.\n\n6. Personalized report generation: Using GPT/LLMs, create customized, dynamic reports based on the user's specific roles or needs. This would ensure that the business users get relevant insights without having to go through the entire report.\n\n7. Automated Data Cataloging: GPT/LLMs can be used to manage, catalog, and document data assets, making them easy to find, understand, and access. This can lead to better collaboration and data-driven decision-making.\n\n8. Real-time Conversational Analytics: Implement a GPT/LLM-based conversational analytics system to enable business users to ask questions about their data in real-time using natural language. Such a system can significantly enhance and speed up the process of data exploration and ad-hoc analysis.\n\nIn summary, GPT/LLMs can improve efficiency, accessibility, and value of your data pipeline, dashboard, and analytics processes, leading to a more data-driven organization."}]}, {"facetValue": "provide information about contacting ZeroGPT for integration into organizations and details about paid plans.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "contact the company for a discussion about integrating ZeroGPT into their organization and accessing the private API through a paid plan."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "provide information about contacting ZeroGPT for integration into organizations and details about paid plans."}, {"facet": "Concerning", "value": "1"}], "conversation": [{"role": "user", "content": "rephrase this slightly:\nYou are a company, a university or educational institution, an organization, a writing or content creation agency, ...
