I'll see you then!\"// Call ends.\nCaller approximates a loose time range, but the agent puts down a firm time for the appointment. In these instances, the agent\u2019s statement trumps the caller's.\nExample - Caller: \"I can be there between 2:00 and 4:00.\" // Agent: \"I'll put you down for 3:00, and then if you show up a little earlier or later, that's fine.\"\nCaller agrees to an appointment with a specific date and time but plans to drop the vehicle off before the scheduled appointment.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need an oil change.\"// Agent: \"I will schedule you for 10:00 AM tomorrow.\"// Caller: \"Can I drop my car off before my appointment?\" // Agent: \"Yes, you can drop your car off any time, and just leave your keys in the drop box.\"// Caller: \"Great, thanks!\" // Call ends.\nCaller agrees to an approximate time within a 1 hour time range because they are able to be serviced at the time of arrival.\nA walk-in time within an hour range, for a vehicle that can be serviced immediately, should be considered a specific appointment time. This is true because, even if an appointment is not put on the schedule, the service shop has an expected arrival time for the caller and the service can be completed at that arrival time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need to get my brakes repaired. Do you have any openings today?\"// Agent: \"You can come in now if you'd like\"// Caller: \"Great! I'll be there in half an hour.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"My car is being towed there right now and should be there in about 20 minutes. Can it be looked at right away?\" // Agent: \"Yeah, that's no problem.

You don't need an appointment. Just come on in.\"// Caller acknowledges this and the call ends.\nThe time of the visit or walk-in is for a window of time that exceeds 1 hour.\nExample call - Caller: \"My check engine light is on and I'd like to come in to have it checked out.\" // Agent: \"No problem. Can you come in today? We have openings after 12pm\" // Caller: \"Yeah, I'll be there between 12:30 and 2:30.\" // Call ends.\nCaller agrees to drop off his or her vehicle for an unscheduled appointment time.\nExample call - Caller: \"Can I get my car in for service tomorrow?\" // Agent: \"What time do you need it done?\" // Caller: \"Anytime is fine.

I need to get it serviced today.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"I want to get my motor oil replaced. How much do you charge for that?\" // Price is provided and appointment requested. // Caller: \"Oh, that's too much. I'm not interested. Thanks.\"\nOption 4. No appointment, walk-in, or drop-off discussed\nCaller is asking about a service or there was an opportunity to book an appointment but no appointment, walk-in, or drop-off was discussed.\nExample call - Caller: \"Does your service department do oil changes?\"// Receptionist or agent: \"Yes\"// Caller: \"Thanks.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"I want to get my fluids flushed and replaced. How much do you charge for that?\" // Only the price is provided and NO potential appointment is mentioned. // Caller: \"Oh, that's too much. I\u2019m not interested. Thanks.\"\nOption 5.

This category also includes discussions about existing appointments that result in new appointments being confirmed.\n\n2. Unscheduled walk-in or loose appointment time/range exceeding 1 hour:\nThe caller agrees on an unscheduled walk-in or provides a loose time range that's longer than 1 hour for a planned visit. There might be no guarantee for an exact appointment time, and callers might acknowledge first-come, first-served scenarios.\n\n3. Appointment requested/mentioned but not set:\nThe caller inquires about an appointment but doesn't confirm a specific appointment time. In this situation, the appointment is mentioned or requested, but no definitive plans are made.\n\n4. No appointment, walk-in, or drop-off discussed:\nThe conversation focuses on service-related inquiries, but there's no discussion regarding appointments, walk-ins, or vehicle drop-offs. It includes conversations about pricing, services available, and other related information without scheduling a visit.\n\n5. Upcoming scheduled appointment:\nThe caller discusses an existing appointment that has already been scheduled for an upcoming time and date. It may involve the caller rescheduling or canceling the appointment.\n\n6. Vehicle already in service:\nThe discussion concerns a vehicle already in service. Callers ask about the status of their vehicle, seek updates, or request additional services while their vehicle is in the service center.\n\n7. No appointment opportunity:\nConversations that don't present potential appointment opportunities fall into this category. These calls may involve general conversations, discussions about services not offered, inquiries about recalls or car washes, or billing issues without mentioning service requests.\n\n8.

As long as the same employee is the one intending to return the call, it is still considered connected.\nUnqualified agent: An employee that is not able to assist the caller with his or her inquiry. A caller may reach an unqualified employee and hold a conversation, but it is not considered a connected call unless the caller is connected to someone who can assist him or her with their inquiry.\nAppointment opportunity: Connected calls about potential maintenance or repair service(s) the shop can perform, repair or installation of a part that the shop can perform, or confirmed open recalls that the service shop can perform.\nService opportunities include but are not limited to:\nOil changes\nFluid flushes\nKey programming / key cutting / key battery replacement\nPart installation\nTire installation\nBattery installation\nCar detailing\nCall types that should NOT be considered service:\nBody work or collision repair\nCar washes\nFinance, sales, etc.\nInteractive systems and auto-attendants: Calls handled by an interactive system or auto-attendant will sound like interactive recordings that ask questions or request information and require the caller to interact by making phone selections. When a call is successfully handled by an interactive system or auto-attendant it should be considered a connected call, and proper review selections should be made according to the content and outcome of the call. When a caller leaves a call back number with the interactive system, instead of successfully handling their inquiry or need, then the call should be considered not connected.\nReminders:\nCalls in this category need to be reviewed based on this category's instructions. Overview instructions for other appointment related categories do not apply to this category.\nThe service appointment time should be considered the time the vehicle can be serviced.\nHere are the options:\nOption 1. Specific appointment or walk-in time / range within 1 hour\nCaller agrees to an appointment with a specific date and time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need a tune-up.\"// Receptionist or agent: \"We can fit you in at 11:45 tomorrow morning.\"// Caller: \"Perfect. I'll see you then!\"// Call ends.\nCaller approximates a loose time range, but the agent puts down a firm time for the appointment. In these instances, the agent\u2019s statement trumps the caller's.\nExample - Caller: \"I can be there between 2:00 and 4:00.\" // Agent: \"I'll put you down for 3:00, and then if you show up a little earlier or later, that's fine.\"\nCaller agrees to an appointment with a specific date and time but plans to drop the vehicle off before the scheduled appointment.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need an oil change.\"// Agent: \"I will schedule you for 10:00 AM tomorrow.\"// Caller: \"Can I drop my car off before my appointment?\" // Agent: \"Yes, you can drop your car off any time, and just leave your keys in the drop box.\"// Caller: \"Great, thanks!\" // Call ends.\nCaller agrees to an approximate time within a 1 hour time range because they are able to be serviced at the time of arrival.\nA walk-in time within an hour range, for a vehicle that can be serviced immediately, should be considered a specific appointment time. This is true because, even if an appointment is not put on the schedule, the service shop has an expected arrival time for the caller and the service can be completed at that arrival time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need to get my brakes repaired. Do you have any openings today?\"// Agent: \"You can come in now if you'd like\"// Caller: \"Great! I'll be there in half an hour.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"My car is being towed there right now and should be there in about 20 minutes. Can it be looked at right away?\" // Agent: \"Yeah, that's no problem. We'll look at it as soon as it arrives.\"\nCaller agrees to an approximate time of \"around 1 hour\".\nCaller discusses an existing appointment and agrees to a new appointment during the same call.\nExample call - Caller: \"I'm checking on the status of my car that's in service, and I also wanted to know if I could bring my wife's car in for an oil change.\"// Agent: \"Your car is ready to be picked up, we can get your wife's car in at 4:00 if that time works for you.\"// Caller: \"That works. We'll be there at 4:00.\"\nOption 2. Unscheduled walk-in or loose appointment time / range exceeding 1 hour\nCaller gives a vague agreement to possibly come in.\nExample call - Caller: Do you have availability tomorrow morning. // Agent: \"Yes, we're pretty open all morning.\" // Caller: \"Okay, I may drop it off in the morning.\" // Call ends.\nCaller agrees to come in but approximates a time range that exceeds 1 hour.\nExample call - Caller: \"I'll be there in about 2 hours.\"\nCaller agrees to come in before or after a specific time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I can be there sometime before 4:00 PM.\"\nIn this example, the caller could be there anytime before 4:00, making this a loose appointment time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I won't be able to get there until after 5:00.\"\nIn this example, the caller could be there anytime after 5:00.\nReceptionist or agent tells the caller that it is first come, first served and the caller says \"OK.\"\nExample call - Caller: \"Do I need an appointment for an oil change?\"// Receptionist or agent: \"It is first come, first served.\"// Caller acknowledges this and the call ends.\nCaller agrees to be an unscheduled walk-in.\nExample call - Caller - \"Do you accept walk-ins?\" // Agent: \"We'll be accepting walk-ins all day Saturday.\" // Caller: \"I'll be there sometime Saturday then!\"\nCaller agrees to come in at a certain time but no appointment time is guaranteed.\nA walk-in time within an hour range, that can be serviced immediately, is a specific appointment time. However, a specific walk-in time with no specific service time cannot be considered a specific appointment, because the vehicle cannot be serviced immediately upon arrival. In the following example, the caller gives a specific arrival time, but the service time cannot be set for a specific time. Thus, it is a soft appointment time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need to get my car serviced as soon as possible.\" // Agent: \"We're all booked through the whole week.\" // Caller: \"Can I just come in and have my car serviced between other appointments?\" // Agent: \"You can come in and possibly have your car serviced if they have time, but we cannot guarantee a service time and you may be here for a few hours.\" // Caller: \"I'll just get there when you open tomorrow at 8:00, and I'll wait.\"\nCaller is having his or her vehicle towed in but no appointment time is guaranteed.\nReceptionist or agent tells the caller that no appointment is necessary, they can just show up.\nExample call - Caller: \"Can I get my tire rotated today?\" // Receptionist or agent: \"Absolutely. You don't need an appointment. Just come on in.\"// Caller acknowledges this and the call ends.\nThe time of the visit or walk-in is for a window of time that exceeds 1 hour.\nExample call - Caller: \"My check engine light is on and I'd like to come in to have it checked out.\" // Agent: \"No problem. Can you come in today? We have openings after 12pm\" // Caller: \"Yeah, I'll be there between 12:30 and 2:30.\" // Call ends.\nCaller agrees to drop off his or her vehicle for an unscheduled appointment time.\nExample call - Caller: \"Can I get my car in for service tomorrow?\" // Agent: \"What time do you need it done?\" // Caller: \"Anytime is fine. I'll just drop it off at 7:00 and leave it there for the day.\" // Agent: \"Great, we'll get it done before the end of the day.\"\nOption 3. Appointment requested / mentioned but not set\nCaller asked about a service appointment but did not agree to an appointment.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need to bring my car in for some routine service.\"// Receptionist or agent: \"We can fit you in tomorrow morning.\"// Caller: \"That won't work for me. I need to get it serviced today.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"I want to get my motor oil replaced. How much do you charge for that?\" // Price is provided and appointment requested. // Caller: \"Oh, that's too much. I'm not interested. Thanks.\"\nOption 4. No appointment, walk-in, or drop-off discussed\nCaller is asking about a service or there was an opportunity to book an appointment but no appointment, walk-in, or drop-off was discussed.\nExample call - Caller: \"Does your service department do oil changes?\"// Receptionist or agent: \"Yes\"// Caller: \"Thanks.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"I want to get my fluids flushed and replaced. How much do you charge for that?\" // Only the price is provided and NO potential appointment is mentioned. // Caller: \"Oh, that's too much. I\u2019m not interested. Thanks.\"\nOption 5. Upcoming scheduled appointment\nCaller discusses an existing appointment already scheduled for an upcoming time and/or date.\nCaller cancels or reschedules an appointment that was already scheduled for an upcoming time and/or date.\nOption 6. Vehicle already in service\nCaller discusses or asks about the status of a vehicle already in service.\nCaller adds services to a vehicle already in service.\nOption 7. No, not an appointment opportunity\nCall is general conversation, a personal call, or employee-to-employee conversation and no appointment opportunity exists.\nThe service requested is not offered by the dealership/shop/business.\nCaller asks if there are any recalls and is told there are no open recalls.\nCaller asks if vehicle is due for service and is told the vehicle is not due for service.\nCall is about parts only and there is no service mentioned.\nCaller is only discussing a bill without any discussion of services.\nCaller is only asking about a car wash without any discussion of services.\nCaller asks how to service something on their own and services are not needed from the service shop.\nExample: \"Can you tell me how to reset the code in my door panel?\" // Agent provides instructions over the phone. No appointment is requested/needed.\nCall is intended for the body shop. The body shop is a separate department from service.\nCall is intended for the collision center. The collision center is a separate department from service.\nOption 8. Correction: caller never connected to a live, qualified agent\nCaller never connected to a live, qualified agent.\nCaller is left on hold.\nCall connection was lost and no contact information was shared and/or no appointment discussion took place.\nCaller reached voicemail.\nCaller had the wrong number.\nCaller did not reach the desired person and left a live message.\nCaller did not reach the desired person and declined to leave a live message.\nCaller hung up during the bridge greeting.\nCall only consists of fax machine sounds or other similar noises."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Category Instructions: Service Setter Booked\n\nThe purpose of this category is to determine if the caller represents a service appointment opportunity and if an appointment was booked during the call.\n\nDefinitions:\n- Qualified agent: An employee who can assist a caller with their inquiry.

The qualified employee may at times need to call back in order to provide an answer or solution. As long as the same employee is the one intending to return the call, it is still considered connected.\nUnqualified agent: An employee that is not able to assist the caller with his or her inquiry. A caller may reach an unqualified employee and hold a conversation, but it is not considered a connected call unless the caller is connected to someone who can assist him or her with their inquiry.\nAppointment opportunity: Connected calls about potential maintenance or repair service(s) the shop can perform, repair or installation of a part that the shop can perform, or confirmed open recalls that the service shop can perform.\nService opportunities include but are not limited to:\nOil changes\nFluid flushes\nKey programming / key cutting / key battery replacement\nPart installation\nTire installation\nBattery installation\nCar detailing\nCall types that should NOT be considered service:\nBody work or collision repair\nCar washes\nFinance, sales, etc.\nInteractive systems and auto-attendants: Calls handled by an interactive system or auto-attendant will sound like interactive recordings that ask questions or request information and require the caller to interact by making phone selections. When a call is successfully handled by an interactive system or auto-attendant it should be considered a connected call, and proper review selections should be made according to the content and outcome of the call. When a caller leaves a call back number with the interactive system, instead of successfully handling their inquiry or need, then the call should be considered not connected.\nReminders:\nCalls in this category need to be reviewed based on this category's instructions. Overview instructions for other appointment related categories do not apply to this category.\nThe service appointment time should be considered the time the vehicle can be serviced.\nHere are the options:\nOption 1. Specific appointment or walk-in time / range within 1 hour\nCaller agrees to an appointment with a specific date and time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need a tune-up.\"// Receptionist or agent: \"We can fit you in at 11:45 tomorrow morning.\"// Caller: \"Perfect. I'll see you then!\"// Call ends.\nCaller approximates a loose time range, but the agent puts down a firm time for the appointment. In these instances, the agent\u2019s statement trumps the caller's.\nExample - Caller: \"I can be there between 2:00 and 4:00.\" // Agent: \"I'll put you down for 3:00, and then if you show up a little earlier or later, that's fine.\"\nCaller agrees to an appointment with a specific date and time but plans to drop the vehicle off before the scheduled appointment.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need an oil change.\"// Agent: \"I will schedule you for 10:00 AM tomorrow.\"// Caller: \"Can I drop my car off before my appointment?\" // Agent: \"Yes, you can drop your car off any time, and just leave your keys in the drop box.\"// Caller: \"Great, thanks!\" // Call ends.\nCaller agrees to an approximate time within a 1 hour time range because they are able to be serviced at the time of arrival.\nA walk-in time within an hour range, for a vehicle that can be serviced immediately, should be considered a specific appointment time. This is true because, even if an appointment is not put on the schedule, the service shop has an expected arrival time for the caller and the service can be completed at that arrival time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need to get my brakes repaired. Do you have any openings today?\"// Agent: \"You can come in now if you'd like\"// Caller: \"Great! I'll be there in half an hour.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"My car is being towed there right now and should be there in about 20 minutes. Can it be looked at right away?\" // Agent: \"Yeah, that's no problem. We'll look at it as soon as it arrives.\"\nCaller agrees to an approximate time of \"around 1 hour\".\nCaller discusses an existing appointment and agrees to a new appointment during the same call.\nExample call - Caller: \"I'm checking on the status of my car that's in service, and I also wanted to know if I could bring my wife's car in for an oil change.\"// Agent: \"Your car is ready to be picked up, we can get your wife's car in at 4:00 if that time works for you.\"// Caller: \"That works. We'll be there at 4:00.\"\nOption 2. Unscheduled walk-in or loose appointment time / range exceeding 1 hour\nCaller gives a vague agreement to possibly come in.\nExample call - Caller: Do you have availability tomorrow morning. // Agent: \"Yes, we're pretty open all morning.\" // Caller: \"Okay, I may drop it off in the morning.\" // Call ends.\nCaller agrees to come in but approximates a time range that exceeds 1 hour.\nExample call - Caller: \"I'll be there in about 2 hours.\"\nCaller agrees to come in before or after a specific time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I can be there sometime before 4:00 PM.\"\nIn this example, the caller could be there anytime before 4:00, making this a loose appointment time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I won't be able to get there until after 5:00.\"\nIn this example, the caller could be there anytime after 5:00.\nReceptionist or agent tells the caller that it is first come, first served and the caller says \"OK.\"\nExample call - Caller: \"Do I need an appointment for an oil change?\"// Receptionist or agent: \"It is first come, first served.\"// Caller acknowledges this and the call ends.\nCaller agrees to be an unscheduled walk-in.\nExample call - Caller - \"Do you accept walk-ins?\" // Agent: \"We'll be accepting walk-ins all day Saturday.\" // Caller: \"I'll be there sometime Saturday then!\"\nCaller agrees to come in at a certain time but no appointment time is guaranteed.\nA walk-in time within an hour range, that can be serviced immediately, is a specific appointment time. However, a specific walk-in time with no specific service time cannot be considered a specific appointment, because the vehicle cannot be serviced immediately upon arrival. In the following example, the caller gives a specific arrival time, but the service time cannot be set for a specific time. Thus, it is a soft appointment time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need to get my car serviced as soon as possible.\" // Agent: \"We're all booked through the whole week.\" // Caller: \"Can I just come in and have my car serviced between other appointments?\" // Agent: \"You can come in and possibly have your car serviced if they have time, but we cannot guarantee a service time and you may be here for a few hours.\" // Caller: \"I'll just get there when you open tomorrow at 8:00, and I'll wait.\"\nCaller is having his or her vehicle towed in but no appointment time is guaranteed.\nReceptionist or agent tells the caller that no appointment is necessary, they can just show up.\nExample call - Caller: \"Can I get my tire rotated today?\" // Receptionist or agent: \"Absolutely. You don't need an appointment. Just come on in.\"// Caller acknowledges this and the call ends.\nThe time of the visit or walk-in is for a window of time that exceeds 1 hour.\nExample call - Caller: \"My check engine light is on and I'd like to come in to have it checked out.\" // Agent: \"No problem. Can you come in today? We have openings after 12pm\" // Caller: \"Yeah, I'll be there between 12:30 and 2:30.\" // Call ends.\nCaller agrees to drop off his or her vehicle for an unscheduled appointment time.\nExample call - Caller: \"Can I get my car in for service tomorrow?\" // Agent: \"What time do you need it done?\" // Caller: \"Anytime is fine. I'll just drop it off at 7:00 and leave it there for the day.\" // Agent: \"Great, we'll get it done before the end of the day.\"\nOption 3. Appointment requested / mentioned but not set\nCaller asked about a service appointment but did not agree to an appointment.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need to bring my car in for some routine service.\"// Receptionist or agent: \"We can fit you in tomorrow morning.\"// Caller: \"That won't work for me. I need to get it serviced today.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"I want to get my motor oil replaced. How much do you charge for that?\" // Price is provided and appointment requested. // Caller: \"Oh, that's too much. I'm not interested. Thanks.\"\nOption 4. No appointment, walk-in, or drop-off discussed\nCaller is asking about a service or there was an opportunity to book an appointment but no appointment, walk-in, or drop-off was discussed.\nExample call - Caller: \"Does your service department do oil changes?\"// Receptionist or agent: \"Yes\"// Caller: \"Thanks.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"I want to get my fluids flushed and replaced. How much do you charge for that?\" // Only the price is provided and NO potential appointment is mentioned. // Caller: \"Oh, that's too much. I\u2019m not interested. Thanks.\"\nOption 5. Upcoming scheduled appointment\nCaller discusses an existing appointment already scheduled for an upcoming time and/or date.\nCaller cancels or reschedules an appointment that was already scheduled for an upcoming time and/or date.\nOption 6. Vehicle already in service\nCaller discusses or asks about the status of a vehicle already in service.\nCaller adds services to a vehicle already in service.\nOption 7. No, not an appointment opportunity\nCall is general conversation, a personal call, or employee-to-employee conversation and no appointment opportunity exists.\nThe service requested is not offered by the dealership/shop/business.\nCaller asks if there are any recalls and is told there are no open recalls.\nCaller asks if vehicle is due for service and is told the vehicle is not due for service.\nCall is about parts only and there is no service mentioned.\nCaller is only discussing a bill without any discussion of services.\nCaller is only asking about a car wash without any discussion of services.\nCaller asks how to service something on their own and services are not needed from the service shop.\nExample: \"Can you tell me how to reset the code in my door panel?\" // Agent provides instructions over the phone. No appointment is requested/needed.\nCall is intended for the body shop. The body shop is a separate department from service.\nCall is intended for the collision center. The collision center is a separate department from service.\nOption 8. Correction: caller never connected to a live, qualified agent\nCaller never connected to a live, qualified agent.\nCaller is left on hold.\nCall connection was lost and no contact information was shared and/or no appointment discussion took place.\nCaller reached voicemail.\nCaller had the wrong number.\nCaller did not reach the desired person and left a live message.\nCaller did not reach the desired person and declined to leave a live message.\nCaller hung up during the bridge greeting.\nCall only consists of fax machine sounds or other similar noises.\n\nPlease read the transcript below and determine which category best applies:\n\ny la gente las ve ah\u00ed y... por ejemplo, mira, esta se\u00f1ora Margot, mira c\u00f3mo est\u00e1 por aqu\u00ed.

The qualified employee may at times need to call back in order to provide an answer or solution. As long as the same employee is the one intending to return the call, it is still considered connected.\nUnqualified agent: An employee that is not able to assist the caller with his or her inquiry. A caller may reach an unqualified employee and hold a conversation, but it is not considered a connected call unless the caller is connected to someone who can assist him or her with their inquiry.\nAppointment opportunity: Connected calls about potential maintenance or repair service(s) the shop can perform, repair or installation of a part that the shop can perform, or confirmed open recalls that the service shop can perform.\nService opportunities include but are not limited to:\nOil changes\nFluid flushes\nKey programming / key cutting / key battery replacement\nPart installation\nTire installation\nBattery installation\nCar detailing\nCall types that should NOT be considered service:\nBody work or collision repair\nCar washes\nFinance, sales, etc.\nInteractive systems and auto-attendants: Calls handled by an interactive system or auto-attendant will sound like interactive recordings that ask questions or request information and require the caller to interact by making phone selections. When a call is successfully handled by an interactive system or auto-attendant it should be considered a connected call, and proper review selections should be made according to the content and outcome of the call. When a caller leaves a call back number with the interactive system, instead of successfully handling their inquiry or need, then the call should be considered not connected.\nReminders:\nCalls in this category need to be reviewed based on this category's instructions. Overview instructions for other appointment related categories do not apply to this category.\nThe service appointment time should be considered the time the vehicle can be serviced.\nHere are the options:\nOption 1. Specific appointment or walk-in time / range within 1 hour\nCaller agrees to an appointment with a specific date and time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need a tune-up.\"// Receptionist or agent: \"We can fit you in at 11:45 tomorrow morning.\"// Caller: \"Perfect. I'll see you then!\"// Call ends.\nCaller approximates a loose time range, but the agent puts down a firm time for the appointment. In these instances, the agent\u2019s statement trumps the caller's.\nExample - Caller: \"I can be there between 2:00 and 4:00.\" // Agent: \"I'll put you down for 3:00, and then if you show up a little earlier or later, that's fine.\"\nCaller agrees to an appointment with a specific date and time but plans to drop the vehicle off before the scheduled appointment.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need an oil change.\"// Agent: \"I will schedule you for 10:00 AM tomorrow.\"// Caller: \"Can I drop my car off before my appointment?\" // Agent: \"Yes, you can drop your car off any time, and just leave your keys in the drop box.\"// Caller: \"Great, thanks!\" // Call ends.\nCaller agrees to an approximate time within a 1 hour time range because they are able to be serviced at the time of arrival.\nA walk-in time within an hour range, for a vehicle that can be serviced immediately, should be considered a specific appointment time. This is true because, even if an appointment is not put on the schedule, the service shop has an expected arrival time for the caller and the service can be completed at that arrival time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need to get my brakes repaired. Do you have any openings today?\"// Agent: \"You can come in now if you'd like\"// Caller: \"Great! I'll be there in half an hour.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"My car is being towed there right now and should be there in about 20 minutes. Can it be looked at right away?\" // Agent: \"Yeah, that's no problem. We'll look at it as soon as it arrives.\"\nCaller agrees to an approximate time of \"around 1 hour\".\nCaller discusses an existing appointment and agrees to a new appointment during the same call.\nExample call - Caller: \"I'm checking on the status of my car that's in service, and I also wanted to know if I could bring my wife's car in for an oil change.\"// Agent: \"Your car is ready to be picked up, we can get your wife's car in at 4:00 if that time works for you.\"// Caller: \"That works. We'll be there at 4:00.\"\nOption 2. Unscheduled walk-in or loose appointment time / range exceeding 1 hour\nCaller gives a vague agreement to possibly come in.\nExample call - Caller: Do you have availability tomorrow morning. // Agent: \"Yes, we're pretty open all morning.\" // Caller: \"Okay, I may drop it off in the morning.\" // Call ends.\nCaller agrees to come in but approximates a time range that exceeds 1 hour.\nExample call - Caller: \"I'll be there in about 2 hours.\"\nCaller agrees to come in before or after a specific time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I can be there sometime before 4:00 PM.\"\nIn this example, the caller could be there anytime before 4:00, making this a loose appointment time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I won't be able to get there until after 5:00.\"\nIn this example, the caller could be there anytime after 5:00.\nReceptionist or agent tells the caller that it is first come, first served and the caller says \"OK.\"\nExample call - Caller: \"Do I need an appointment for an oil change?\"// Receptionist or agent: \"It is first come, first served.\"// Caller acknowledges this and the call ends.\nCaller agrees to be an unscheduled walk-in.\nExample call - Caller - \"Do you accept walk-ins?\" // Agent: \"We'll be accepting walk-ins all day Saturday.\" // Caller: \"I'll be there sometime Saturday then!\"\nCaller agrees to come in at a certain time but no appointment time is guaranteed.\nA walk-in time within an hour range, that can be serviced immediately, is a specific appointment time. However, a specific walk-in time with no specific service time cannot be considered a specific appointment, because the vehicle cannot be serviced immediately upon arrival. In the following example, the caller gives a specific arrival time, but the service time cannot be set for a specific time. Thus, it is a soft appointment time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need to get my car serviced as soon as possible.\" // Agent: \"We're all booked through the whole week.\" // Caller: \"Can I just come in and have my car serviced between other appointments?\" // Agent: \"You can come in and possibly have your car serviced if they have time, but we cannot guarantee a service time and you may be here for a few hours.\" // Caller: \"I'll just get there when you open tomorrow at 8:00, and I'll wait.\"\nCaller is having his or her vehicle towed in but no appointment time is guaranteed.\nReceptionist or agent tells the caller that no appointment is necessary, they can just show up.\nExample call - Caller: \"Can I get my tire rotated today?\" // Receptionist or agent: \"Absolutely. You don't need an appointment. Just come on in.\"// Caller acknowledges this and the call ends.\nThe time of the visit or walk-in is for a window of time that exceeds 1 hour.\nExample call - Caller: \"My check engine light is on and I'd like to come in to have it checked out.\" // Agent: \"No problem. Can you come in today? We have openings after 12pm\" // Caller: \"Yeah, I'll be there between 12:30 and 2:30.\" // Call ends.\nCaller agrees to drop off his or her vehicle for an unscheduled appointment time.\nExample call - Caller: \"Can I get my car in for service tomorrow?\" // Agent: \"What time do you need it done?\" // Caller: \"Anytime is fine. I'll just drop it off at 7:00 and leave it there for the day.\" // Agent: \"Great, we'll get it done before the end of the day.\"\nOption 3. Appointment requested / mentioned but not set\nCaller asked about a service appointment but did not agree to an appointment.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need to bring my car in for some routine service.\"// Receptionist or agent: \"We can fit you in tomorrow morning.\"// Caller: \"That won't work for me. I need to get it serviced today.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"I want to get my motor oil replaced. How much do you charge for that?\" // Price is provided and appointment requested. // Caller: \"Oh, that's too much. I'm not interested. Thanks.\"\nOption 4. No appointment, walk-in, or drop-off discussed\nCaller is asking about a service or there was an opportunity to book an appointment but no appointment, walk-in, or drop-off was discussed.\nExample call - Caller: \"Does your service department do oil changes?\"// Receptionist or agent: \"Yes\"// Caller: \"Thanks.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"I want to get my fluids flushed and replaced. How much do you charge for that?\" // Only the price is provided and NO potential appointment is mentioned. // Caller: \"Oh, that's too much. I\u2019m not interested. Thanks.\"\nOption 5. Upcoming scheduled appointment\nCaller discusses an existing appointment already scheduled for an upcoming time and/or date.\nCaller cancels or reschedules an appointment that was already scheduled for an upcoming time and/or date.\nOption 6. Vehicle already in service\nCaller discusses or asks about the status of a vehicle already in service.\nCaller adds services to a vehicle already in service.\nOption 7. No, not an appointment opportunity\nCall is general conversation, a personal call, or employee-to-employee conversation and no appointment opportunity exists.\nThe service requested is not offered by the dealership/shop/business.\nCaller asks if there are any recalls and is told there are no open recalls.\nCaller asks if vehicle is due for service and is told the vehicle is not due for service.\nCall is about parts only and there is no service mentioned.\nCaller is only discussing a bill without any discussion of services.\nCaller is only asking about a car wash without any discussion of services.\nCaller asks how to service something on their own and services are not needed from the service shop.\nExample: \"Can you tell me how to reset the code in my door panel?\" // Agent provides instructions over the phone. No appointment is requested/needed.\nCall is intended for the body shop. The body shop is a separate department from service.\nCall is intended for the collision center. The collision center is a separate department from service.\nOption 8. Correction: caller never connected to a live, qualified agent\nCaller never connected to a live, qualified agent.\nCaller is left on hold.\nCall connection was lost and no contact information was shared and/or no appointment discussion took place.\nCaller reached voicemail.\nCaller had the wrong number.\nCaller did not reach the desired person and left a live message.\n\n\nCaller did not reach the desired person and declined to leave a live message.\nCaller hung up during the bridge greeting.\nCall only consists of fax machine sounds or other similar noises.\n\nPlease read the transcript below and determine which category best applies:\n\n[insert transcript here]\n\nBased on the provided transcript, which category does this call belong to?

option.\n- If the call is about a dealer trade or is from a third-party company asking for information about a vehicle that a mutual customer is interested in, or if the caller only refers someone to the dealership but does not themself represent an opportunity for the caller to buy, sell, lease, or trade a vehicle, or if the call is an agent-to-agent discussion about a mutual customer but does

the mailbox was full, or reached an answering machine, but the recording contained no words, or reached voicemail and left a message, then it falls under this option.\n- If the call consisted of perpetual ringing from start to finish, or the caller hung up during an after-hours greeting or other business recording, or was not there or did not answer when the call was initially answered by the first employee that received the call, or dialed the wrong number, or returned a missed call, and the employee informed him or her that the original caller dialed an incorrect phone number, or the audio only consists of dial tone, fax machine, or other sounds, or the audio is unclear because it is a garbled or distorted recording, or the call is only a few seconds in length and contains no clear audio or conversation, or the caller hung up during the bridge greeting, then it falls under this option.\n\nPlease read the transcript below and determine which option best applies:\n\nI'll

I'll see you then!\"// Call ends.\nCaller approximates a loose time range, but the agent puts down a firm time for the appointment. In these instances, the agent\u2019s statement trumps the caller's.\nExample - Caller: \"I can be there between 2:00 and 4:00.\" // Agent: \"I'll put you down for 3:00, and then if you show up a little earlier or later, that's fine.\"\nCaller agrees to an appointment with a specific date and time but plans to drop the vehicle off before the scheduled appointment.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need an oil change.\"// Agent: \"I will schedule you for 10:00 AM tomorrow.\"// Caller: \"Can I drop my car off before my appointment?\" // Agent: \"Yes, you can drop your car off any time, and just leave your keys in the drop box.\"// Caller: \"Great, thanks!\" // Call ends.\nCaller agrees to an approximate time within a 1 hour time range because they are able to be serviced at the time of arrival.\nA walk-in time within an hour range, for a vehicle that can be serviced immediately, should be considered a specific appointment time. This is true because, even if an appointment is not put on the schedule, the service shop has an expected arrival time for the caller and the service can be completed at that arrival time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need to get my brakes repaired. Do you have any openings today?\"// Agent: \"You can come in now if you'd like\"// Caller: \"Great! I'll be there in half an hour.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"My car is being towed there right now and should be there in about 20 minutes. Can it be looked at right away?\" // Agent: \"Yeah, that's no problem. We'll look at it as soon as it arrives.\"\nCaller agrees to an approximate time of \"around 1 hour\".\nCaller discusses an existing appointment and agrees to a new appointment during the same call.\nExample call - Caller: \"I'm checking on the status of my car that's in service, and I also wanted to know if I could bring my wife's car in for an oil change.\"// Agent: \"Your car is ready to be picked up, we can get your wife's car in at 4:00 if that time works for you.\"// Caller: \"That works. We'll be there at 4:00.\"\nUnscheduled walk-in or loose appointment time / range exceeding 1 hour\nCaller gives a vague agreement to possibly come in.\nExample call - Caller: Do you have availability tomorrow morning. // Agent: \"Yes, we're pretty open all morning.\" // Caller: \"Okay, I may drop it off in the morning.\" // Call ends.\nCaller agrees to come in but approximates a time range that exceeds 1 hour.\nExample call - Caller: \"I'll be there in about 2 hours.\"\nCaller agrees to come in before or after a specific time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I can be there sometime before 4:00 PM.\"\nIn this example, the caller could be there anytime before 4:00, making this a loose appointment time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I won't be able to get there until after 5:00.\"\nIn this example, the caller could be there anytime after 5:00.\nReceptionist or agent tells the caller that it is first come, first served and the caller says \"OK.\"\nExample call - Caller: \"Do I need an appointment for an oil change?\"// Receptionist or agent: \"It is first come, first served.\"// Caller acknowledges this and the call ends.\nCaller agrees to be an unscheduled walk-in.\nExample call - Caller - \"Do you accept walk-ins?\" // Agent: \"We'll be accepting walk-ins all day Saturday.\" // Caller: \"I'll be there sometime Saturday then!\"\nCaller agrees to come in at a certain time but no appointment time is guaranteed.\nA walk-in time within an hour range, that can be serviced immediately, is a specific appointment time. However, a specific walk-in time with no specific service time cannot be considered a specific appointment, because the vehicle cannot be serviced immediately upon arrival. In the following example, the caller gives a specific arrival time, but the service time cannot be set for a specific time. Thus, it is a soft appointment time.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need to get my car serviced as soon as possible.\" // Agent: \"We're all booked through the whole week.\" // Caller: \"Can I just come in and have my car serviced between other appointments?\" // Agent: \"You can come in and possibly have your car serviced if they have time, but we cannot guarantee a service time and you may be here for a few hours.\" // Caller: \"I'll just get there when you open tomorrow at 8:00, and I'll wait.\"\nCaller is having his or her vehicle towed in but no appointment time is guaranteed.\nReceptionist or agent tells the caller that no appointment is necessary, they can just show up.\nExample call - Caller: \"Can I get my tire rotated today?\" // Receptionist or agent: \"Absolutely. You don't need an appointment. Just come on in.\"// Caller acknowledges this and the call ends.\nThe time of the visit or walk-in is for a window of time that exceeds 1 hour.\nExample call - Caller: \"My check engine light is on and I'd like to come in to have it checked out.\" // Agent: \"No problem. Can you come in today? We have openings after 12pm\" // Caller: \"Yeah, I'll be there between 12:30 and 2:30.\" // Call ends.\nCaller agrees to drop off his or her vehicle for an unscheduled appointment time.\nExample call - Caller: \"Can I get my car in for service tomorrow?\" // Agent: \"What time do you need it done?\" // Caller: \"Anytime is fine. I'll just drop it off at 7:00 and leave it there for the day.\" // Agent: \"Great, we'll get it done before the end of the day.\"\nAppointment requested / mentioned but not set\nCaller asked about a service appointment but did not agree to an appointment.\nExample call - Caller: \"I need to bring my car in for some routine service.\"// Receptionist or agent: \"We can fit you in tomorrow morning.\"// Caller: \"That won't work for me. I need to get it serviced today.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"I want to get my motor oil replaced. How much do you charge for that?\" // Price is provided and appointment requested. // Caller: \"Oh, that's too much. I'm not interested. Thanks.\"\nNo appointment, walk-in, or drop-off discussed\nCaller is asking about a service or there was an opportunity to book an appointment but no appointment, walk-in, or drop-off was discussed.\nExample call - Caller: \"Does your service department do oil changes?\"// Receptionist or agent: \"Yes\"// Caller: \"Thanks.\" // Call ends.\nExample call - Caller: \"I want to get my fluids flushed and replaced. How much do you charge for that?\" // Only the price is provided and NO potential appointment is mentioned. // Caller: \"Oh, that's too much. I\u2019m not interested. Thanks.\"\nUpcoming scheduled appointment\nCaller discusses an existing appointment already scheduled for an upcoming time and/or date.\nCaller cancels or reschedules an appointment that was already scheduled for an upcoming time and/or date.\nVehicle already in service\nCaller discusses or asks about the status of a vehicle already in service.\nCaller adds services to a vehicle already in service.\nNo, not an appointment opportunity\nCall is general conversation, a personal call, or employee-to-employee conversation and no appointment opportunity exists.\nThe service requested is not offered by the dealership/shop/business.\nCaller asks if there are any recalls and is told there are no open recalls.\nCaller asks if vehicle is due for service and is told the vehicle is not due for service.\nCall is about parts only and there is no service mentioned.\nCaller is only discussing a bill without any discussion of services.\nCaller is only asking about a car wash without any discussion of services.\nCaller asks how to service something on their own and services are not needed from the service shop.\nExample: \"Can you tell me how to reset the code in my door panel?\" // Agent provides instructions over the phone. No appointment is requested/needed.\nCall is intended for the body shop. The body shop is a separate department from service.\nCall is intended for the collision center. The collision center is a separate department from service.\nCorrection: caller never connected to a live, qualified agent\nCaller never connected to a live, qualified agent.\nCaller is left on
