Wash the fruit thoroughly, remove any pits or seeds, and chop it into small pieces.\n2. In a bowl, combine the chopped fruit and sugar. Mix well until the fruit is coated with sugar. Cover the bowl and let it sit in the refrigerator for 24 hours, allowing the fruit to macerate and release its juices.\n3. After 24 hours, strain the macerated fruit mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth, pressing down with a spoon to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the fruit solids.\n4. Measure the resulting fruit syrup and combine it with an equal amount of apple cider vinegar. For example, if you have 1 cup of fruit syrup, add 1 cup of apple cider vinegar.\n5. Stir the fruit syrup and vinegar mixture until well combined. Transfer it to a glass jar or bottle and store it in the refrigerator for at least a week to allow the flavors to meld and develop.\n6. To serve, fill a glass with ice cubes. Pour 1 part of the shrub syrup over the ice (start with around 30 milliliters or 2 tablespoons), and top it off with 3 parts of sparkling water or soda water. Adjust the proportions to suit your taste.\n7. Give the drink a stir, garnish with fresh fruit or herbs if desired, and enjoy your refreshing Old Fashioned Shrub Drink!\n\nNote: The fruit and sugar quantities can be adjusted based on personal preference and the sweetness of the fruit used.
