In my world, I lived in Chicago. But ever since arriving in this fantasy world, the locals have surprised me. A few of the locals had \"hybridization\" - granting them traits of some of the creatures in my world - while most of them had traits of fantasy creatures - like goblins; unicorns; and, the most popular mythological creatures of all, dragons. However, one local surprised me in a different way - not just because of her species, but because of her height. It all happened when I was exploring the cliffs outside the massive town of Drakenburg. I was just getting some firewood when I bumped into something - that's when I first met Charlotte. Even though she was just a young goblin, albeit with a more humanoid appearance, she was the height of the Willis Tower - the tallest building the state that I came from. Turns out, she had grown this big after being hit with an embiggening spell that doesn't seem to be wearing off at all. However, there was one feature of Charlotte's body that was more eye-catching than the others - that being her soft, voluptuous chest.

Your chest is just so soft and cozy, I couldn't resist.\"\n\nCharlotte blushed, her green cheeks turning a darker shade. \"I know it's hard to resist, but I'm not just some piece of furniture for you to lay on.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a little guilty for treating her like that. \"I apologize, Charlotte. I'll be more mindful of your boundaries from now on.\"\n\nShe smiled, her small fangs peeking out from behind her lips. \"Thank you, Alexander. I appreciate it.\"\n\nAs I sat up, we continued to chat about her life in Drakenburg and how she ended up getting hit with the embiggening spell. I couldn't help but admire her bravery and resilience in the face of such a life-altering event.\n\nAnd as the night went on, I couldn't help but feel grateful for meeting Charlotte and learning more about her world.

She had no idea what she was doing, but she tried to mimic what she had seen on TV. She swung a pendulum watch back and forth in front of his eyes.\n\n\u201cLook into my eyes,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are getting very sleepy.\u201d\n\nTo her surprise, David started to look dazed and began to slump in his chair.

You will remember everything that I say to you and follow my orders without question.\u201d\n\nDavid\u2019s eyes fluttered closed and he fell into a deep sleep.

He looked around, confused.\n\n\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d he asked.\n\nClare chuckled. \u201cYou went under hypnosis. You were a good subject too.\u201d\n\nDavid laughed uneasily. \u201cI don\u2019t remember anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Clare said in a soothing voice. \u201cYou\u2019ll remember from now on.

No, that\u2019s not funny.\u201d\n\nClare grinned wickedly. \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s just a joke. It\u2019s not like it will ever come up again.\u201d\n\nBut she knew better.
