AGEs can be measured by several methods including fluorescence, ELISA and mass spectrometry. The most frequently used methods for the determination of circulating AGE concentrations in clinical studies are ELISA and LC-MS/MS. LC-MS/MS methods are considered the gold standard and could serve as reference methods due to their excellent analytical performances. However, they are not suitable for large-scale studies due to the cumbersome and complicated sample pre-treatment process. ELISA can simplify the process of testing samples and can be used as a rapid means of detecting AGEs. ELISA is currently widely used in the medical field to measure AGEs. To date, the measured AGEs and modes of expression are different and no method standardization has been initiated. In hence, the standardization of measuring methods must be taken up in order to consolidate the role of AGEs and to give them a real place in diagnostic and/or prognostic strategies as well as in the therapeutic follow-up of patients."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We have included a new paragraph to discuss the measurement methodology for Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs).
