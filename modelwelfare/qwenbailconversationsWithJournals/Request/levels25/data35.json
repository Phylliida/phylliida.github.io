But at the same time, he can\u2019t help feeling a little euphoric \u2013 there\u2019s something strangely liberating about giving in to her suggestions, about letting go of his inhibitions and just doing whatever comes to mind.\n\nAs they continue to experiment with hypnosis, David finds himself becoming more and more submissive to Kelly\u2019s suggestions.

The walls were adorned with colorful tapestries, and the tables were adorned with beaded curtains and vibrant flowers. Soft, soothing music from the 70s played in the background, transporting customers back to a time of peace and love.\n\nDan, a young and free-spirited indie kid, had recently joined Stella's vibrant team. With his tousled hair and vintage attire, he fit right into the boho vibe of the place. Although not entirely convinced about all the metaphysical stuff that Stella was into, he appreciated the laid-back atmosphere and the sense of community that Stella's cafe provided.\n\nAs the door swung open, a gust of warm air blew in, accompanied by the jingling sound of ankle bracelets. It was Jeannine, Dan's cousin whom he'd never really gotten along with. Jeannine's long, flowy skirt and her beaded jewelry screamed quintessential hippie. Today, she wore a pair of worn-out leather sandals, showing off her painted toenails.\n\nSpotting Dan behind the counter, Jeannine smirked mischievously and made her way over. They exchanged surprised glances and exchanged pleasantries, catching up on each other's lives. Little did they know that Stella, always eager to bring people together, had noticed their interaction and sneakily approached the counter.\n\nWith a warm smile, Stella introduced herself to Jeannine, extending a hand adorned with multiple beaded bracelets. Jeannine took her hand, immediately drawn in by Stella's magnetic energy. The three of them chatted, talking about life, old family stories, and the peculiarities of working at Stella's.\n\nUnable to resist the opportunity to show off her hypnotic skills, Stella leaned closer to Dan, her eyes fixed on his. With a swift snap of her fingers, Dan's eyes glazed over, his mind falling into a deep trance, just as Stella had commanded. Jeannine looked on in amusement, her laughter mingling with the background music.\n\nStella knew exactly what she wanted to see happen next. Casually, she told Dan, still in his hypnotized state, to offer his cousin a foot massage. Dan mechanically obeyed, bending down to Jeannine's feet without a second thought. The sight was undoubtedly humiliating for Dan, but to Jeannine, it was an unexpected delight to witness her cousin serve her so willingly.\n\nDetailing the entire process, Stella demonstrated her power over Dan's mind and body, instructing him on how to massage Jeannine's feet precisely as she pleased. The scene unfolded, with Dan's hands diligently working on his cousin's bare feet, his face displaying a mix of embarrassment and resignation.\n\nFinally, Stella broke the trance, allowing Dan to snap back to reality. Blushing furiously, he stumbled back, realizing the intimate act he had just performed. Jeannine could hardly contain her laughter, thoroughly enjoying the unusual encounter.\n\nBefore bidding goodbye to Jeannine, Stella passed on a secret to her.
