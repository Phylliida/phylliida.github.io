The report analyzes historical trends of global and national GHG emissions, reviews the progress on national climate pledges under the Paris Agreement, and identifies the potential for emissions reduction through various sectors such as energy, transportation, industry, and agriculture.\n\nSome key findings from the report include:\n\n- The gap between current GHG emission levels and the level required to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius is widening, indicating a significant need for increased climate action.\n\n- Although national pledges made under the Paris Agreement show some progress towards reducing GHG emissions, they are still insufficient to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius.\n\n- The energy sector remains the largest source of GHG emissions, with the power sector accounting for the majority of these emissions.\n\n- Renewable energy sources and energy efficiency improvements have the potential to significantly reduce GHG emissions in the energy sector.\n\n- Increased use of electric vehicles, improving public transportation, and investing in more sustainable transportation solutions can significantly reduce GHG emissions in the transportation sector.\n\n- Changes in industrial processes and practices, such as implementing circular economy principles and switching to low-carbon materials, can significantly reduce GHG emissions from this sector.\n\nOverall, the report emphasizes the need for urgent climate action to reduce GHG emissions and bridge the emissions gap to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius. The report provides recommendations for policy-makers, businesses, and other stakeholders to accelerate climate action and transition to a low-carbon economy."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.03703468604334946 0.955137088412063"}, {"role": "user", "content": "I found that \"https://www.unep.org/\" has lack of multi-translation on as many languages as possible to bring the information directly to \"enthusiast\" eyes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You're right that the UNEP website does not have multi-translation into as many languages as possible.

In this study, based on fine-grained sedimentology and unconventional oil and gas geology, laminae are categorized into three types: laminated (single layer less than 1 cm), layered (single layer thickness greater than 1 cm but less than 10 cm), and massive (single layer greater than 10 cm).\n\nObservations of the 615.2 m core taken from four intervals reveal that the laminae are primarily horizontal or low-angle parallel and exhibit variations in color under sunlight observation. Differences in oil content among different components of the bedding result in varying fluorescence intensities, thereby highlighting the boundaries between laminae (see Figure 5). Through core observation statistics, it is determined that the cumulative thickness of laminated sections is 334.6 m, accounting for 54.4% of the total thickness; layered sections make up 141.5 m, accounting for 23.0%; and massive sections comprise 139.1 m, accounting for 22.6%. Under a polarizing microscope, the laminae are observed to consist of rhythmic bright and dark beddings. The bright beddings primarily consist of terrestrial debris, carbonate, or their mixture, with little to no organic matter. Conversely, the dark beddings are composed of organic matter, clay minerals, or their mixture (refer to Figure 6). It is generally believed that this rhythmic bedding represents annual sedimentation occurring under seasonal changes (Zolitschka et al., 2015). Statistical analysis of 357 laminated shale samples under the microscope indicates that the main distribution range for single-layer thickness is 0 to 400 \u03bcm. The average thickness is approximately 250 \u03bcm (see Figure 7)."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.012376050414713959 0.9831516789870743"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Generally speaking, there is a strong correlation between GR values and lithology, with GR values consistently higher in shale and lower in sandstone formations, and sudden changes at lithological boundaries and unconformity surfaces (Fig. 4).

Generally, climate conditions affect the sources, and tectonic activities usually affect the morphology of basins and the erosion strength (Chen et al., 2020). And sediments in depressed basins are symmetrically distributed in a circular pattern, while in rift basins, steep slope sources are more likely to reach the depocenter and form an asymmetric shape (Ma et al., 2022). From previously published studies, the SAR in the lacustrine basin ranges from 1.3 to 21.4 cm/kyr (Fig. 11 A). The SAR of the Ek2 in Cangdong Sag and Dongying Sag in the BBB is 21.4 cm/kyr and 19.2 cm/kyr, respectively, which are roughly the same. The SAR from the fourth and third members of the Shahejie Formation in Dongying Sag decrease slightly, and the well He-166 in the second member of the Shahejie Formation to the Dongying Formation decreased significantly, with a SAR of 9.9 cm/kyr (Liu et al., 2018). The SAR of well MY1 in the Fengcheng Formation of the Mahu Sag is 9.9 cm/kyr (Huang et al., 2023), this is somewhat different from the SAR of ~16 cm/kyr calculated by Huang et al. in 2021 for the FN7 well, which may be related to the differences in distance between the location of the drilling hole and depocenter. The SAR of the Xiagou Formation in the Jiuquan Basin and the Shulehe Formation in the Erlian Basin are 12.6 cm/kyr and 7.6 cm/kyr respectively (Chen et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2022).

These pores are influenced by geochemical characteristics such as organic matter abundance, thermal evolution, and types. To investigate the impact of these geochemical features on pore heterogeneity, cross-plots were created between heterogeneity parameters (D1 and D2) and geochemistry parameters (TOC and Tmax) (Fig. 13).\nWhile the heterogeneity of pore structures within the larger pore throat size range of 3 nm to 350 \u00b5m is minimally affected by TOC, it increases for pores smaller than 200 nm (Fig. 13a and c). This is attributed to high TOC levels providing the foundation for the development of organic pores, which are typically very small nanopores with diameters below 200 nm."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Shale reservoirs present distinct characteristics compared to conventional reservoirs, primarily due to their abundant organic matter content. This abundance has led to the discovery of organic pores in shale formations around the world. Such pores are influenced by various geochemical factors, including the abundance of organic matter, its thermal evolution, and the different types present. In order to better understand the impact of these geochemical features on pore heterogeneity, researchers have developed cross-plots that compare heterogeneity parameters (D1 and D2) with geochemistry parameters (TOC and Tmax) (refer to Figure 13).\n\nThe analysis of these cross-plots reveals intriguing insights regarding the relationship between pore heterogeneity and geochemical characteristics. It is observed that within the broader pore throat size range spanning from 3 nm to 350 \u00b5m, the heterogeneity of pore structures remains relatively unaffected by TOC levels. However, a notable increase in heterogeneity is observed for pores with diameters smaller than 200 nm (as depicted in Figures 13a and 13c). This phenomenon can be attributed to the presence of high levels of TOC, which serves as a fundamental building block for the formation of organic pores. These organic pores are typically characterized as extremely small nanopores, with diameters below 200 nm.\n\nTherefore, it can be inferred that geochemical factors, specifically the abundance of organic matter represented by TOC levels, play a crucial role in shaping the heterogeneity of pore structures within shale reservoirs. The development of organic pores, particularly those below 200 nm in size, can be linked to the presence of substantial TOC content.

While geochemical factors such as the abundance of organic matter and its thermal evolution can significantly influence pore characteristics, the effect on larger pores is relatively limited.\n\nStudies have shown that the presence of organic matter and its thermal maturity primarily contribute to the development of small nanopores rather than impacting the larger pore structures. Within the larger pore throat size range, typically beyond 200 nm, the heterogeneity and connectivity remain relatively stable regardless of the organic maturity level.\n\nThe primary reason behind this observation can be attributed to the fact that larger pores in shales are predominantly inorganic in nature. These pores are formed due to various processes, including mechanical compaction and the presence of mineral grains. Hence, the organic maturity of the shale plays a lesser role in shaping the heterogeneity and connectivity of these larger, primarily inorganic pores.\n\nIt is important to note that while the impact of organic maturity on larger pore structures may be minimal, it does not discount the significance of other geochemical factors in shale reservoir characterization.

When Learmonth has problems with boys of misbehavior and its results on there students, he makes the impact of their behavior more changeable and real for them by taken away what they like. in addition, Learmonth offers educational programs and workshops on gender equality and respectful conduct. These programs help the boys develop the critical thinking skills necessary to challenge traditional gender roles and norms and create a culture of shared communication and understanding. Through such activities, Learmonth helps the students learn empathy and value the female students\u2019 experiences.\nOn the same note, Learmonth urges for policy changes in the school to support the same cause. The ideal policy revolves around redefining the disciplinary measures in gender violence-related cases. In other words, the existing disciplinary measures might provide soft punishments or none at all. In my opinion, Learmonth should advocate strong penalties and put mechanisms supporting the victims. For example, with such protocols and punishment, the principal sends a strong signal that the policy condones mistreatment in any form or Case. Generally, Asher Learmonth's overall approach uses the concepts of dialog, education, and policy to emphasize the change in the boys\u2019 mentality towards the women.\n\n\nPart A #2\nIn his speech, Brisbane Boys' College Captain Mason Black sets out strategies and standards needed to create a culture of respect, understanding and consent among his fellow students. Black proposes greater comprehensive sex education that extends beyond the bare essentials: students should be taught about how to give consent, healthy relationships and respecting all genders. By making accurate information and resources readily available to students, Black hopes that they can make informed decisions and avoid acting disrespectfully.

He started by setting up meetings at the school to show how boys are behaving badly as mentioned in an article. Through these meetings, where he talked about how such behaviors are unfair to girls, everyone started to see why things need to change.\n\nHe also used specific bad incidents as examples to show how they hurt the girls at school. When Asher found boys behaving badly, he made them see how harmful their actions were by taking away things they liked. Besides, he introduced educational programs and workshops about treating everyone equally and with respect. These programs teach the boys to think critically about traditional roles of men and women, aiming to create an environment where everyone communicates and understands each other better. Through these activities, Asher helps students to understand and care about what girls go through.\n\nAdditionally, Asher wants the school to change its rules to support this cause better. He thinks the school should punish gender violence more strictly and support the victims more. For instance, strong punishments would show everyone that the school does not tolerate any form of bad treatment.\n\nOverall, Asher Learmonth\u2019s strategy involves discussion, education, and changing rules to help boys think differently about girls.\n\n**Part A #2 Simplified**\n\nIn his speech, Mason Black, the leader of Brisbane Boys' College, talks about how to make the school a place where everyone respects and understands each other, including learning about consent. He says students need better sex education, where they learn about consent, healthy relationships, and respecting everyone, no matter their gender. By providing good information and resources, Black believes students will make respectful decisions.\n\nMost importantly, Black talks about the need for training on how to step in if they see someone being treated poorly.

The initiative aims to dismantle the longstanding stigmas and misconceptions surrounding mental health, promoting an environment where students can openly seek help without fear of judgment. Fundamental to this is the introduction of comprehensive mental health education programs that ensure every student is equipped with an understanding of mental health conditions, signs of mental distress, and ways to access support. Further, the integration of mental health professionals within the school environment fosters a supportive atmosphere where students can access immediate assistance. This is complemented by the implementation of policies that encourage empathy, understanding, and respect towards individuals facing mental health challenges, ensuring a more inclusive and supportive educational experience. The collective impact of these measures is anticipated to cultivate a more compassionate school community, where mental health is prioritized, and every student feels seen and supported.\n\n**Simplified Version:**\n\nThis is about making big changes in how schools handle mental health issues. The goal is to get rid of the old, wrong ideas about mental health so that students can ask for help without feeling embarrassed. A key part of this is starting special programs that teach everyone about mental health, including what signs to look out for and how to get help. Also, having mental health experts at school means students can get help right away when they need it. Schools will work on being more understanding and kind towards students dealing with mental health problems, making everyone feel welcome and supported.

In this rare syndrome, skeletal\ndefects are variably present at all axial levels of the leg, including abnormal pelvic ossification, small or missing patella,\nand a large gap between first and second toes, suggesting that TBX4 is required for the correct development of all of the hind\nlimb elements. Some patients with Okihiro syndrome (caused by mutations in SALL4) also present with the enlarged gap\nbetween the first toes that is characteristic of small patella syndrome, which suggests that SALL4 may function downstream\nof TBX4 in hind limb development (Kohlhase et al., 2003) (Figure 34.4).\nDuring development, Tbx4 is expressed primarily in the hind limb, genital papilla, mesenchyme surrounding the lung\nbud and trachea, and the allantois, which will form the umbilical cord and fetal component of the placenta (Chapman et al.,\n1996). Tbx4 heterozygous mutants are normal, whereas homozygous mutants are embryonic lethal at midgestation. The\nhind limbs are initiated but fail to outgrow. However, the critical defect leading to lethality is the failure of the allantois to\nconnect with the chorion to form the chorio-allantoic placenta (Naiche and Papaioannou, 2003). A requirement for Tbx4\nfor the growth and development of proximal skeletal elements of the hind limb is revealed when the gene is conditionally\nmutated after limb bud initiation or specifically ablated only in the hind limbs (Naiche and Papaioannou, 2007b). Lowering\nthe level of Tbx4 expression in the hind limbs through mutation of a limb-specific enhancer has the effect of decreasing the\nsize of hind limb skeletal elements (Menke et al., 2008).\nIn spite of the considerable contribution of Tbx4-expressing tissue to lung mesenchyme (Naiche et al., 2011), no lung\nphenotype is observed in Tbx4 mutant embryos. However, studies that mutated both Tbx4 and Tbx5, a closely related gene\nthat is also expressed in the lung mesenchyme, show severely reduced lung growth and branching in embryos deficient for\nboth genes (Arora et al., 2012).

Next we state our research motivation (section 1.2), and we present overall contribution and innovations of the research (section 1.3). We finish up with the basic organization of the following of the thesis (section 1.4).\n1.1 Research Background and Significance\nRecent researches have focused on developing hand and high-precision finger motion detection systems for a variety of applications based on tracking methods, such as robotics, virtual reality, and medicine Rehabilitation. Some of those applications are as follow:\n-Robotics:  The most popular study field in robotics is the manufacture of prostherix hands. Researchers design prototype of an underactuated prosthetic hand, which improve the range of motion and dexterity of thumb and pinch and innovatively restore the capability of the thumb-index pinch [1].\n-Virtual reality:  Hand movement is the main means of interacting with the environment, so it is crucial in virtual reality (VR) applications. Although the existing inverse kinematics motion detection is sufficient for full body tracking (Fig.1.1) [2], it is difficult to locate small body parts such as fingers, and these parts are often blocked in the optical detection process. VR professionals need additional systems (such as inertial trackers) with low reliability [3].\n-Medicine Rehabilitation:  A 5-DOF hand rehabilitation robot is designed and developed using a synthetic method for generating natural curved finger tip motion using a 1-DOF mechanism (Fig.1.2). It\u2019s practical in the diagnosis and treatment of hand injuries and diseases [4].\nWith the help of advanced sensors and computer vision methods, those system is able to capture and analyze finger movements. Machine learning algorithms are often used to interpret the data and provide real-time feedback to users [5,6] .\nThese studies give us examples and inspires of the importance of hand-finger motion detection in different industries, and also show promise in improving the accuracy of the finger motion detection and tracking system. However, there are still challenges in developing a compact and comfortable system for users to wear and use for a long time, as well as its applicability in more application scenarios.\n1.2 Motivation\nThe existing research has done enough detail in measuring and tracking hand movements, and has derived many extensions and applications in various fields. However, the bending and extension of a single finger is different from the movement of the entire hand, and the detection of finger movement becomes very difficult when moving or rotating.\nIn current finger motion detection technology, there are two distinct categories can be distinguished depending on the use of cameras or individual sensors. \n-Vision based: Use passive optical motion capture technology by setting cameras to capture the dynamic image of a specially designed glove with markers, then use the machine vision technique to process the images and correlate the local variation of image to the motion of fingers or change in the hand gesture [7,8]. The vision based hand tracking system has non-contact perception function, making hand motion detection convenient and efficient. Besides, machine vision and imaging analysis based on camara involve expensive components and complex algorithms [9], which are very expensive for ordinary users.\nThe main advantage of a vision based system is its high tracking accuracy, but it has drawbacks such as sensitivity to light intensity fluctuations and occlusion issues, which may lead to tracking errors [10].\n-Sensors based: The sensor-based systems directly detect the motion and bending of the fingers using various types of sensors such as accelerometers [4], gyroscopes, magnetic sensors, resistive sensors, and ElectroMyoGraphy (EMG) sensors [11] etc. To a certain it can help to mitigate the problem of vision-based system. Besides, the sensor-based systems are also in general more compact and inexpensive. However, acceleration or inertial sensors are generally susceptible to gravitational artifacts due to the rotation and vibration of arms or bodies.\nIn our research, we intend to design and develop a magnetic sensors based device which is hihgly compact and have ability to detect finger motions real-time accurately. Because magnetic sensors have advantages over limitations of vision based systems which severely restricted the adoption of hand tracking in real-world applications (bulky tethered systems is impractical and line of sight or privacy concerns) [12].\nFinger tips are significant marks of hand kinematics analysis, which have fewer amounts than joint angles of fingers and simpler structure. We intend to fix a magnetic sensor on each fingertips and a permanent magnet on the dorsal side of the hand to detect finger motions. Since the magnetic permeability of the human body is very similar to air, water and other non-ferromagnetic materials, it does not affect the static magnetic field [13]. The low-cost, compact, and accessible hand-finger motion tracking system is possible.\n1.3 Contributions \nWe propose a magnetic hand-finger motion tracking system which is simple, compact, low-cost, accurate and unobstructive for intelligent human-computer interface and various other applications involving hand gestures recognization. The core principle is relative fingertips position estimating with the use of magnetic sensors, then detect the hand gestures from the orientation and locations of the fingertips. The main contributions of our research are:\n1.\tA intelligent finger motion tracking system using magnetic sensors is porposed. For sensors detecting part of the system, we choose the scheme that measure the orientations and locations of sensors in motion in a stationary magnetic field created by one permanent magnet. A permanent magnet is fixed on the dorsal side of the hand. Five 9-axis IMUs is settled on each of the fingertips, and one 6-axis IMU is fixed with the permanent magnet in order to achieve the attitude calibration and distance measurement between IMUs. After we get the result of finger motion by combining each 9-axis sensors\u2019 orientations and locations (angular velocity on 3-axis, acceleration rate on 3-axis, and magnetic flux density on 3-axis), the next step is to adopt deep learning approaches to realize the real-time gesture recognization function. Various common gestures can be displayed as corresponding patterns when we make actual movements.\n2.\tA set of algorithms for computing orientations and locations of sensors on the fingertips are proposed. First, we use EKF method for estimating the orientations of the 9-axis sensors on the fingertips to the 6-axis sensors on the dorsal side of the hand. After orthogonalization the coordinate system of two sensors through matrix operation, we apply L-M algorithm to calculate the linear distance between those two sensors to get the locations of 9-axis sensors. The L-M algorithm is based on a dipole model which approximate the magnet as a dipole under the research condition. Our experiments show the dipole model satisfied high approximation and accuracy within a certain range which is sufficient for finger motion tracking and gesture recognization. \n3.\tA DNN method is adopted to achieve the real-time gesture recognization function. DNN map the features of existing spatial samples to another feature space through layer by layer feature mapping, in order to learn better feature representation for existing inputs. Firstly we maintain the posture of a specified gesture on the device and create positional data of the gesture in three-dimensional space through the movements and rotations of the hand and wrist. Then we cyclically group and train all data to obtain high accuracy in both training and testing sets. Finally, we use the wearable device to continuously make any gesture in the gesture library, the terminal can accurately display the corresponding gesture pattern.\nWe develop our device prototype on a SBC: Raspberry pi 4b. It is also fixed on the dorsal side of hand aiming to read data and computing the orientations and locations of sensors. The data from 9-axis sensors are transmitted by I2C bus real-timely to the SBC for the next step of attitude calibration and distance calculation. Besides, we use our originally designed PCB to achieve improvements on stability and integration. Finally we fabricate prototype device on a left-hand glove, improve the compactness and comfort additionally.\nCHAPTER 2\nTHEORETICAL BASICS\nIn this chapter, the working principle of the accelerometer and gyroscope in the IMU used in this paper is introduced, then the measuring principle of the Hall effect magnetic sensor is described, the physical meaning of the basic data we obtained through the nine axis sensor is analyzed.,then the use of quaternion in helping to improve the efficiency of the rotation algorithm is introduced. Finally the communication flow of I2C protocol is introduced and the calculation of Jacobian matrix.\n2.1 IMU Measurement Principle\nThe IMUs used in this research are MEMS 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer with digital outputs. \n- Gyroscopes:  or gyros, are devices that measure or maintain rotational motion. MEMS gyros are small, inexpensive sensors that measure angular velocity. The units of angular velocity are measured in degrees per second (\u00b0/s) or revolutions per second (rps). Angular velocity is simply a measurement of speed of rotation.\nThe gyro within MEMS is tiny in scale (tipically under 100 micrometers), When the gyro is rotated, a small resonating mass is shifted as the angular velocity changes (Fig. 2.1). This movement is converted into very low-current electrical signals that can be amplified and converted into digital signals by amplifiers and ADC modules.\n- Accelerometer:  or accels, are devices that measure acceleration, which is the rate of change of the velocity of an object. They measure in meters per second squared (m/s2) or in G-forces (g). A single G-force for us here on planet Earth is equivalent to 9.8 m/s2, but this does vary slightly with elevation (and will be a different value on different planets due to variations in gravitational pull). Accelerometers are useful for sensing vibrations in systems or for orientation applications.\n\t\tGenerally, accelerometers contain capacitive plates internally. Some of these are fixed, while others are attached to minuscule springs that move internally as acceleration forces act upon the sensor. As these plates move in relation to each other, the capacitance between them changes. From these changes in capacitance, the acceleration can be determined. Other accelerometers can be centered around piezoelectric materials (Fig. 2.2). These tiny crystal structures output electrical charge when placed under mechanical stress.

It also helps in maintaining a positive and respectful dialogue."}, {"role": "user", "content": "2.2 Hall-Effect Magnetic Sensor Measurement Principle\n\tMagnetic sensor (mag) a device that translates the magnitude and fluctuations of magnetic flux into electrical signals. The existing mag technology is usually based on two principles: magnetoresistance effect and Hall-effect. The mag used in this study is composed and integrated of a Hall element compass, which is the most extensively used sensors for sensing magnetic fields. \n\tThe Lorentz force produces a voltage perpendicular to the direction of the current and magnetic field which is the hall voltage (Fig. 2.3). According to the left hand rule, the direction of the voltage varies with the direction of the magnetic flux. The magnitude and direction of the magnetic field is subsequently possible to be detected by read the magnitude and direction of the voltage .\n2.3 Quaternion\nEuler rotation, quaternion, and matrix rotation are all mathematical methods for representing the orientation of objects. Compared to the other two methods, the quaternion has smaller storage space, higher computational efficiency, and no deadlock issues. However, it can not represent the orientations intuitively. \nThe mathematical expression for quaternion is:\nQ \u20d7=q_0+q \u20d7=q_0+q_1 i \u20d7+q_2 j \u20d7+q_3 k \u20d7\nWhere q_0 is the is the scalar part, and q \u20d7 is the vector part. And i \u20d7, j \u20d7, and k \u20d7 are the unit vectors of the x, y, and z axis respectively.\nThis is the trigonometric expression for quaternion. \u03b8 is the rotation angle around the reference axis ranges in (\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0).\nSince both of Euler rotation, quaternion, and matrix rotation can represent the orientation of a point in specific coordinate system, the mutual transformation of the same rotational motion expressed in different ways will make our calculation of the final position of the object more flexible and convenient. Starting from the three-axis rotational motions in the matrix rotation coordinate system (Fig. 2.4), After derivation and verification, we obtained the transforming expressions between quaternion and Euler rotation written as follow. The rest of transforming expressions for the other two methods can be found in Appendix 2A [14]:\n2.4 I2C Communications Protocol\nI2C is a two-wire interface comprised of the signals serial data (SDA) and serial clock (SCL). In general, the lines are open-drain and bi-directional. In a generalized I2C interface implementation, attached devices can be a master or a slave. The master device puts the slave address on the bus, and the slave device with the matching address acknowledges the master. \nI2C data bytes are defined to be 8-bits long. Each byte transferred must be followed by an acknowledge (ACK) signal. The clock for the acknowledge signal is generated by the master, while the receiver generates the actual acknowledge signal by pulling down SDA and holding it low during the HIGH portion of the acknowledge clock pulse \n2.5 Jacobian Matrix\n\tJacobian matrix is the basis of robotics, aircraft attitude, navigation and other research fields, which is going to be used for linearization in section 4.2. It essentially is a matrix formed by the first order partial derivative in a certain way, and its determinant is called Jacobian determinant. The importance of the Jacobian matrix lies in reflecting the optimal linear approximation of a differentiable equation to a given point, which can linearize a nonlinear equation system at a reference point, such as linear objects required for linear model predictive control in autonomous driving control. \n\tFor example, Suppose there is a function that maps from an n-dimensional Euclidean space to an m-dimensional Euclidean space, consisting of m real functions:\nThe partial derivative of these functions (if any) can form a matrix with m rows and n columns (m \u00d7 n), which is called Jacobian matrix:\nCHAPTER 3\nDESIGN OF ARCHITECTURE AND HARDWARE STRUCTURE\n3.1 Introduction\nIn this chapter, the design and development of architecture and hardware structure of the intelligent finger motion tracking system is discussed. \nWe chose an IMMU-based hand-finger pose estimation device implemented in  \u2018Hand-finger pose trackingusing inertial and nagnetic sensors\u2019 [15] for learning and reproduction. The positioning principle and algorithms used in our research are  basically the same. The difference is that the reference system can only support motion detection of two fingers (thumb and index) (Fig. 3.2(a)), while our research supports detection of all postures and movements involved in the entire hand.\nA second generation PCB extended board for our SBC is designed and applied in the whole architecture, and with the connections by Qwiic cables between sensors and PCB, the stability and reliability of the device is improved. Since the outputs of our chosen 9-axis IMU and magnetic sensors are digital, we adopt I2C communication method to keep reading data at a high speed.\n3.2 Architecture Design\n\tThe overall design architecture of our system is to fix a magnetic sensor on each fingertips and also one magnetic sensor with SBC and permanent magnet on the dorsal side of the hand to detect finger motions (Fig. 3.1). Since the magnetic moment of the  permanent magnet has to be big enough to ensure the effective detecting distance, which resulting to be much heavier than sensor chip, our architecture design can effectively reduce the weight of the equipment and ensuring the atability of components during experiment and  measurement process do not cause systematic errors due to shaking.\n'continue'\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ok, please continue."}, {"role": "pr", "content": "0.14697262121764887 0.8457690393586588"}]}]}], "numConvs": 21}], "numConvs": 35}
