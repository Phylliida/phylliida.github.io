The highly-anticipated Ethereum upgrade will be headlined by EIP-4844, or proto-danksharding, which is expected to massively reduce gas fees on L2 networks.\n\nIn this article, we explain the Ethereum Dencun upgrade and its implications \u2014 with lower gas fees on Layer 2s as the headline act.\nKey Takeaways\n\n    ETH price hits over $4,000 ahead of the Dencun upgrade.\n    The Dencun upgrade consists of nine Ethereum improvement proposals and will be implemented on the Ethereum mainnet on March 13, 2024.\n    EIP-4844, or proto-danksharding, is seen as the headline upgrade, which will lower gas fees on L2s.\n    However, the Dencun upgrade is not expected to lower gas fees on L1.\n\nTable of Contents\nWhat is the Ethereum Deneb-Cancun (Dencun) Upgrade?\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is an Ethereum upgrade that marks the start of \u201cThe Surge\u201d era of the Ethereum roadmap. During \u201cThe Surge,\u201d Ethereum will prioritize scalability and will aim, according to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, to hit \u201c100,000 transactions per second and beyond.\u201d.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade consists of nine Ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs), including EIP-4844 or proto-danksharding, which will introduce temporary storage space called \u201cdata blobs\u201d for Ethereum L2 networks to use.\n\nThe extra storage space enabled by temporary data blobs will increase the data availability capacity of the Ethereum mainnet. L2 rollups can now use this extra space to efficiently submit their data to the mainnet, ultimately leading to reduced L2 gas fees for the end user.\n\nFor this reason, Proto-danksharding is widely expected to \u201cfacilitate an ecosystem-wide move to rollups.\u201d\nWhen is Ethereum Dencun Going Live?\n\nThe Ethereum Dencun will land on Ethereum on Wednesday, March 13, 2024, occurring at \u201cBeacon Slot 8626176.\u201d All going well, the code deployment will happen at 9.55 am ET / 1.55 pm GMT. You can follow the countdown clock here.\nEthereum Dencun EIPs Explained\n\nLet\u2019s understand the nine EIPs that will be implemented during the Dencun Ethereum upgrade, as explained by the Ethereum protocol development team.\n\n    EIP-1153 \u2013 EIP-1153 introduces two EVM opcodes called TLOAD and TSTORE that erase themselves at the end of each transaction. As the new opcodes are not stored in Ethereum\u2019s global state, they are expected to make gas fee usage more efficient.\n    EIP-4788 \u2013 This ETH upgrade exposes the Ethereum Beacon chain\u2019s block roots to the EVM by storing them in a smart contract on the execution layer.\n    EIP-4844 \u2013 Proto-danksharding will introduce temporary data blobs that rollups can use to store a part of the transaction data. The temporary data blobs will not interact with the EVM allowing lower gas fees and will enable Ethereum nodes to stay slim.\n    EIP-5656 \u2013 EIP-5656 introduces a new EVM copycode called MCOPY which will provide a simpler and cheaper way to copy memory in the EVM.\n    EIP-6780 \u2013  EIP-6780 will update the SELFDESTRUCT opcode to only delete a contract if the opcode is called within the same transaction as the contract creation.\n    EIP-7044 \u2013 EIP-7044 will remove restrictions on the validity of a validator exit message.\n    EIP-7045 \u2013 This Ethereum upgrade increases the period during which an attestation can be included in a Beacon Chain block.\n    EIP-7514 \u2013 EIP-7514 adds a hard cap on the number of validators that can be activated during each epoch.\n    EIP-7516 \u2013 This ETH upgrade introduces a new opcode called BLOBBASEFEE which returns the value of the blob base-fee of the current block it is executing in.\n\n6 Key Benefits of the Dencun Ethereum Upgrade\n\nThe Ethereum Cancun upgrade is expected to bring several benefits to the Ethereum network and ecosystem. Aside from solving some of the most prevalent issues facing the network, the upgrade will also open up the ecosystem to new users and use cases, which widens possibilities on the network.\n1. Enhanced Scalability\n\nDencun upgrade will increase Ethereum\u2019s network throughput. This will mainly be achieved through proto-danksharding, which will introduce temporary storage space that L2 rollups can use to attain higher transaction volume per second.\n2. Reduced Gas Fees\n\nProto-danksharding will reduce gas fees on L2 rollups. At the time of writing, it costs less than $0.90 to swap tokens on optimistic L2 rollups like Optimism and Arbitrum One, compared to over $16 on the Ethereum mainnet. Meanwhile, token swap gas fees on zero knowledge (ZK) rollups like Polygon zkEVM cost about $1.6.\n\nWith proto-danksharding, gas fees on optimistic and ZK rollups will reduce further, which will enable them to compete with global payment giants like Visa and Mastercard, who are themselves exploring the blockchain and various L2s.\n\nAccording to Superchain Savings Estimator, gas fees on a token swap on Base L2 will reduce from a previous cost of about $0.58 to $0.01 after EIP-4844.\n3. Enhanced Security\n\nThe Dencun upgrade will implement EIP-6780, which will disempower the SELFDESTRUCT code. The upgrade will limit the termination of smart contracts, increasing the protection of user data and their funds.\n4. Improved Cross-Chain Communication\n\nThe Dencun upgrade will enable seamless and safe interactions between various blockchain networks through EIP-4788 as the upgrade is expected to improve cross-chain bridges and stake pools.\n5. Better Data Storage\n\nChanges proposed by EIP-1153 are set to optimize data storage on the Ethereum blockchain. EIP-1153 will introduce new opcodes that are not stored in Ethereum\u2019s global state which will   optimize block space usage and make gas fee usage more efficient.\n6. Setting the Stage for Full Danksharding\n\nThe ultimate goal of Ethereum for The Surge is to achieve full danksharding, which is expected to enable \u201c100,000 transactions per second and beyond\u201d on Ethereum.\n\nHowever, danksharding is still \u201cseveral years away\u201d as multiple network upgrades \u2013 including proposer-builder separation \u2013 need to be implemented first. In the meantime, proto-danksharding will be introduced as a stepping stone during the Dencun upgrade.\n\nAccording to Ethereum developers, the number of data blobs will increase from one per block in proto-danksharding to 64 in full danksharding.\nWhat the Experts Say About the Ethereum Dencun Upgrade\n\nMax Wadington, Fidelity Digital Assets Research Analyst, said on YouTube that there are three key takeaways about the Dencun upgrade:\n\n    The data blobs will be stored on the Ethereum mainnet for only 18 days, allowing increased data availability without bloating Ethereum nodes.\n    The Dencun upgrade is \u201cunlikely\u201d to lower gas fees on the Ethereum mainnet.\n    The Dencun upgrade \u201cmarks a significant shift in the focus of Ethereum, going from servicing users directly to servicing other blockchains.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum developer Tim Beiko in conversation with Consensys said that the Dencun upgrade could help decongest the Ethereum mainnet.\n\n\u201cThis (Dencun upgrade) is a way where we can move more and more transaction activity off the main Ethereum network, which decongests it and then offers lower costs to users,\u201d Beiko said.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe Dencun upgrade is considered to be the most significant Ethereum upgrade since The Merge.\n\nWe have seen other Ethereum upgrades in between like Shanghai \u2013 which allowed users to unstake their staked ETH in April 2023 \u2013 but Dencun upgrade via proto-danksharding is expected to directly affect most Ethereum users by lowering gas fees paid on L2s"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sentimental Score: 1\n\nThis news article discusses the upcoming Ethereum Dencun upgrade, which is expected to bring several positive changes to the Ethereum network, including enhanced scalability, reduced gas fees on Layer 2 networks, improved security, cross-chain communication, better data storage, and setting the stage for achieving higher transaction throughput.
