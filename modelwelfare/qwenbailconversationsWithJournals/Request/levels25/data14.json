And, I'll help explain them to you, in plain and simple language.\n\n[Show the first fact]\n\nFact #1: Did you know that the universe is actually expanding at an accelerating rate? This means that everything in the universe is moving away from each other, and it's happening faster every day. Scientists call this phenomenon \"dark energy,\" and it's still a mystery to them.\n\n[Explain the first fact]\n\nSo, what does that mean? It suggests that the universe might keep expanding forever, and its history might not have an end. This is just one of the many mysteries of the universe that scientists are still trying to figure out.\n\n[Show the second fact]\n\nFact #2: According to the theory of the multiverse, there may be more than one universe. This theory suggests that there could be other universes out there, each with its own different sets of physical laws.\n\n[Explain the second fact]\n\nImagine that there are not just one but multiple realities coexisting at the same time. This is possible under the multiverse theory, but it's difficult to prove. Scientists are still working to gather evidence to support this theory.\n\n[Show the third fact]\n\nFact #3: Almost 95% of the universe is composed of dark matter and dark energy, which we can't see. In fact, we can only observe and infer 5% of the entire universe. \n\n[Explain the third fact]\n\nThis is a baffling discovery, as it means that about ninety-five percent of the universe is made up of completely invisible stuff, and we have practically no way of detecting or understanding it.\n\n[Show the fourth fact]\n\nFact #4: The most massive object in the known universe is a black hole called TON 618, that is around 66 billion times the mass of the sun.\n\n[Explain the fourth fact]\n\nBlack holes are some of the most intriguing objects in the universe, and TON 618 happens to be the most massive black hole that we know of. It's located about 10.37 billion light years away from Earth, making it one of the most distant objects in the universe as well.\n\n[Show the fifth fact]\n\nFact #5: The universe is approximately 13.8 billion years old, based on scientific predictions based on the Big Bang theory.\n\n[Explain the fifth fact]\n\nThe Big Bang is the most widely accepted theory on the universe's origin, and scientists estimate the universe's age from when it all began with an enormous explosion. The timeline of the universe\u2019s history is a long and fascinating story.\n\n[End with a call-to-action]\n\nThanks for watching \"5 Surprising Facts About the Universe - Explained by AI!\" If you have any other interesting facts about the universe to share, leave a comment below.
