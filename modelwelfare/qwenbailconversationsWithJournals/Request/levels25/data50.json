After cracking a few jokes, Buffy assures Xander that Cordy will love his gift. She then slays a vampire which rises from its grave, and they continue on with their conversation.\nThe next morning, Harmony and her friends are shunning Cordy from their discussion groups. They mock Cordy for dating Xander, whom they perceive to be one of the biggest losers in Sunnydale. Elsewhere, Amy asks Willow and Buffy if they plan on attending the V-Day party at the Bronze later that night. Willow is going to see Oz play in the band, while Buffy plans on staying home. As everyone leaves and hands in their assignment, Xander notices that Amy does not have a paper to turn in. To his surprise, he watches as Amy stares at Miss Beakman, the teacher. Miss Beakman then reaches out her hand, as if she is taking Amy's paper which doesn't even exist. Amy then turns and leaves. Xander catches up with Buffy and Willow, telling them that he suspects Amy of messing around with witchcraft. Buffy and Willow remind him that it was Amy's mother, Catherine, who was the witch, and that Amy would never fool around with it. Giles spots Buffy and approaches her. Jenny Calendar sees them and walks over, but Giles brushes her off, saying that he and Buffy are busy at the moment. In the library, Giles warns Buffy that Angel has a long past of committing horrid acts on Valentine's Day. He refuses to tell Buffy any specifics, however, but he does suggest that she be careful. Meanwhile, in the factory, Spike and Angel give Drusilla their V-Day gifts. Spike gives her a necklace, while Angel gives her a freshly torn-out heart.\nThat night, Buffy receives a box of roses, which were left at her doorstep. Buffy opens the box and finds a card with only one word written on it: \"Soon\". At the Bronze, Xander sees Cordy and walks over to give her his gift. After admiring the necklace for a moment, Cordy breaks up with him. Xander is righteously furious, and it only gets worse for him the next day, as everyone in school seems to know that they broke up. Xander then notices Amy walking around, so he runs over and tells her that he knows she's practicing witchcraft. With the upper hand, Xander strikes a deal with Amy: help him cast a love spell on Cordy, and nobody will have to know that she's a witch. After arguing the idea for a while, Amy concedes and tells Xander that she needs a personal item of Cordelia's. Xander finds Cordy near her locker and demands that she return the necklace he gave her. Cordy says it's in her locker, but when she opens it, she hides behind the locker door so she can remove the necklace from her neck without Xander seeing. Meanwhile, Buffy walks into the library and shows Giles the \"Soon\" card. Buffy demands that Giles tell her everything she needs to know about Angel and Valentine's Day, so Giles sits her down and proceeds to read various anecdotes from his books.\nIn a darkened room, Amy and Xander perform the spell that should cause Cordy to fall in love with him. However, Xander soon finds out that the spell had no effect on Cordy. He walks into the library where Buffy is still listening to Giles read his books. Buffy consoles Xander, then suggests that they spend some time together that night. Buffy's suggestions get increasingly lurid, but before they get too close, Amy walks in and tells Xander that she needs to have a word with him. Outside in the hall, Amy tells Xander that the spell didn't work. Xander could care less know, seeing how his dreams of Buffy and himself are finally being fulfilled. However, Amy then suggests that they spend some time together later that night, without the spells and other witchcraft. Xander grows suspicious, and his fears are confirmed when another girl approaches and asks him to accompany her that night. Xander realizes that the spell actually worked. However, instead of affecting Cordy, it zapped every other girl in Sunnydale. Xander goes home to avoid everybody, only to find Willow waiting for him in his bed. Willow wants to him to take her right there in his bed, and when things get a little too steamy between them, Xander pushes her off and runs off.\nThe next day, every single girl in the school ogles Xander as he walks down the hall. He quickly enters the library and tells Giles everything that's going on. Before Giles can process the information, Jenny walks in and tells Giles that they need to talk. However, her attention quickly shifts to Xander, proving that the spell affected not only the girls, but every single female in town. Giles gets between the two and berates Xander for causing all this to happen. He then leaves Xander in the library, dragging Jenny along with him. After they leave, Xander tries to barricade the entrance to the library, but Buffy simply walks in, wearing nothing but a raincoat.)\n\nXander realizes he's finally alone without any girls around, and quickly \nmoves to push the mobile card catalog in front of the doors in an \nattempt to keep it that way. As he heads back toward the table Buffy \npulls the door out and open and steps in wearing only a short black \nraincoat that reaches barely down to mid-thigh and black high heels. \nWhen Xander hears the door swing shut and smack the card catalog behind \nhim he spins around and stares at Buffy in shock. She is standing there \nwith one hand on the catalog and the other propped up on top of the \ntheft detector and smiles at him as she raises her right ankle and rubs \nit against her left calf.\n\nBuffy:  Alone at last.\n\nXander:  (stares open-mouthed) Buff, give me a heart attack!\n\nBuffy:  Oh, (starts a sexy walk toward him) I'm gonna give you more than \nthat. (grabs her raincoat belt to untie it)\n\nXander:  (backs away, gesturing with his hands) Buff, for the love of \nGod, don't open that raincoat.\n\nBuffy:  Come on! It's a party!

Zack hit the ground hard, and his back hit a rock. He tried to get up, but the pain was too much. He knew he was in trouble, and he needed help.\n\nThe other Rangers teleported him to the hospital, and he was rushed to the emergency room. The doctors said he had a fractured back and needed surgery immediately.\n\nZack\u2019s mind was racing with thoughts of the battle and his friends. He was worried about Launch and her daughter, who he had become close to. He hoped they were safe.\n\nMeanwhile, Launch was at home watching the news. She saw a report about the monster attacking the city and the Rangers fighting it. She became worried about Zack and realized he might be hurt or worse.\n\nWithout a second thought, she grabbed Lily and headed to the hospital. When they arrived, she went to the front desk, and the nurse told her where Zack was.\n\nLaunch: (anxiously) Can I see him? I need to see Zack, please.\n\nNurse: (sympathetically) I\u2019m sorry, ma\u2019am, but he\u2019s in surgery right now.

The minutes felt like hours, and they feared for Zack\u2019s life.\n\nFinally, the doctor came out of surgery and approached them.\n\nDoctor: (seriously) Are you family or friends of Zack Taylor?\n\nLaunch: (quickly) We\u2019re his friends. How is he?\n\nDoctor: (gravely) He\u2019s stable, but he\u2019s in a lot of pain, and it will be a while before he can return to active duty.\n\nLaunch: (concerned) Can we see him?\n\nDoctor: (nodding) Yes, but it won\u2019t be for long, and he needs rest. Follow me.\n\nThey walked down the hallway to the recovery room, where they saw Zack lying in a hospital bed, surrounded by machines and monitors.\n\nLaunch: (feeling sad) Oh, Zack. What happened to you?\n\nZack: (weakly) Hey, Launch. It\u2019s good to see you.\n\nLaunch: (sympathetically) Shh, you shouldn\u2019t talk.\n\nZack: (smiling) I\u2019m okay, really. Just a little sore.\n\nLaunch: (tearfully) I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you, Zack. You\u2019re a hero, and you didn\u2019t deserve to get hurt like this.\n\nZack: (gently) It\u2019s okay, Launch. It comes with the job. I knew the risks, but I had to do it to protect our city.\n\nLily: (worried) Is Zack going to be okay, Mommy?\n\nLaunch: (smiling) Yes, sweetie. He\u2019s going to be okay, and we\u2019ll help him heal.\n\nZack: (grateful) Thank you, both of you. You didn\u2019t have to come here.\n\nLaunch: (smiling) Of course we did, Zack. We\u2019re your friends, and you mean a lot to us.\n\nZack: (smiling back) You mean a lot to me too, Launch. Both you and your daughter.\n\nLaunch: (tearfully) We\u2019ll be here for you, Zack, and we\u2019ll help you get through this.\n\nZack: (grinning) I know you will, Launch. With friends like you, I know I can overcome anything.\n\nAs they talked, Zack felt a warm sense of gratitude and love. He had always known Launch was special, but this moment made him realize just how meaningful she was to him. He knew he had feelings for her, and he hoped she felt the same way.\n\nLaunch and Zack\u2019s daughter stayed with him for a little while longer, cheering him up and wishing him a speedy recovery before heading back home. Zack felt better having seen them, and he knew that he would heal much faster with them by his side.\n\nAs he fell asleep that night, Zack knew that he was not alone in this fight. He had his fellow Rangers, his newfound friend the creature Radar, and most importantly, he had Launch and her daughter- his new family. He couldn\u2019t wait to get back out there and fight the good fight with them by his side.\n\nThe next few days were incredibly tough for Zack. He was in a lot of pain and barely able to move. The only thing that kept him going was the love and support of Launch and her daughter.\n\nLaunch visited him every day, bringing flowers, books, and occasionally snacks. She sat with him for hours, talking about everything and nothing. She made him laugh and forget about the pain for a while.\n\nOne day, as they were talking, Zack finally summoned the courage to ask her how she felt about him.\n\nZack: (nervously) Launch, can I ask you something?\n\nLaunch: (curiously) Of course, what is it?\n\nZack: (hesitantly) I know this might not be the best time, but I have to say it. I\u2019ve been thinking about you a lot lately, Launch, and I realized that I have strong feelings for you. I don\u2019t know if you feel the same way, but I had to tell you.\n\nLaunch: (surprised but happy) Zack, I feel the same way. I\u2019ve been trying to hide it, but I\u2019ve been falling for you too.\n\nZack: (relieved) Really? That\u2019s great, Launch. I was scared to tell you.\n\nLaunch: (smiling) You don\u2019t have to be scared, Zack. I like you a lot, and I think we could be really happy together.\n\nZack: (grinning) I think so too, Launch. You\u2019re an amazing woman, and I feel lucky to have you in my life.\n\nLaunch: (blushing) You\u2019re pretty amazing yourself, Zack.\n\nThey shared a long, passionate kiss, which was interrupted by a nurse walking in.\n\nNurse: (apologetically) Sorry to interrupt, but Zack, the doctor wants to see you.\n\nZack: (nodding) Okay, I\u2019ll be right there.\n\nLaunch: (smiling) I\u2019ll stay with you until you come back.\n\nZack said goodbye to Launch and headed to the doctor\u2019s office, hoping his surgery had gone well. The doctor told him that he would need to undergo physical therapy and rehabilitation before he could return to being a Power Ranger. Zack was disappointed but determined to get better and return to his duties.\n\nZack spent the next few weeks in the hospital, undergoing physical therapy and rehabilitation. He worked hard and had the support of his friends and family, especially Launch. Her love and encouragement kept him going, and he knew that he would heal completely with her by his side.\n\nFinally, the day came when he was discharged from the hospital. Launch was waiting for him outside the hospital, holding a big banner and a bouquet of balloons.\n\nLaunch: (excitedly) Welcome home, Zack!\n\nZack: (grinning) Thank you, Launch. It feels good to be back.\n\nLaunch: (smiling) We missed you, Zack, but I\u2019m glad you\u2019re doing better.\n\nZack: (smiling back) I\u2019m glad too, Launch. I missed you too.\n\nThey shared another kiss as Zack held onto Launch tightly, grateful to have her and her daughter in his life.\n\nAs they walked to Zack\u2019s home, they knew that their lives would never be the same.
