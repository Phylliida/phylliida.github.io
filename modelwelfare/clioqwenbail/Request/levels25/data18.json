Unfortunately, we are experiencing some delays with the shipping for one of the systems that was allocated on 6th November. Our team is actively working on resolving this issue and we will provide you with shipping information as soon as it becomes available.\n\nRegarding the remaining Trident systems, we understand the urgency of delivering them before 15th December. We are in constant communication with the shipping company to ensure a timely delivery to KSA. Rest assured, we are doing everything possible to meet this deadline.\n\nHowever, I would like to bring to your attention that there might be potential issues in delivering the units before the mentioned date due to the budget constraints. The recipient has informed us that any deliveries made after 15th December may not be accepted, as the current year's budget for orders must be closed by the end of the year. They have mentioned that a new tender for the next year's budget will be opened.\n\nAdditionally, I understand that there are pending invoices amounting to over 3mn for the delivered main units. This outstanding amount is due to the partial delivery that has taken place. We are actively working on resolving this issue and will communicate with the concerned department to ensure prompt clearance of these invoices.\n\nI apologize for any inconvenience caused by these delays and assure you that we are making every effort to resolve these matters as soon as possible. We will provide you with regular updates on the shipping status of the allocated units.\n\nThank you for your understanding and patience.\n\nBest regards,\nGirish"}]}, {"facetValue": "assist with creating and approving a purchase order for a robotic case on 20th November 2023.
