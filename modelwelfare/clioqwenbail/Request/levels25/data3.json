I'm here to help."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The United States is moving from one era of foreign policy to another. Recent strategy documents, most notably the National Security Strategy and the National Defense Strategy (NDS), make clear that the primacy of counterterrorism, which dominated US foreign policy for years after 9/11, is a thing of the past. Competition with authoritarian great powers\u2014Russia and particularly China\u2014is the order of the day. \u201cThe central challenge to U.S. prosperity and security is the reemergence of long-term, strategic competition by . . . revisionist powers,\u201d the NDS states. \u201cIt is increasingly clear that China and Russia want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model.\u201d1 Geopolitical change, in turn, necessitates bureaucratic change. During the post-9/11 years, the United States did not simply devote time and resources to counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, and the challenges of insecurity in the greater Middle East. It reoriented many of the institutions that make up the US government to address these challenges. Now, departments and agencies across Washington\u2014 the Pentagon, the State Department, and the intelligence community\u2014are having to develop or rediscover an aptitude for high-level geopolitical competition. Additionally, these agencies are replete with employees whose main expertise\u2014arrived at through assignments, education, and experiences\u2014is counterterrorism. Today, these institutions must find ways of making themselves relevant and effective in an intensely contested strategic environment.  Such transitions are never easy, and they pose special challenges for a key part of the US military\u2014 its special operations forces (SOF). At the political level, the Pentagon is being pushed to pivot toward peer competitors and long-term geopolitical challenges. Yet at the operational level, senior military commanders are stretched between dealing with the continuing demands of counterterrorism and contemplating the doctrinal and resource adjustments necessary for competition with Russia and China. For all the talk of great-power rivalry, the reality is that SOF still holds an outsized role in the \u201cforever wars\u201d in which our country remains. Indeed, most of the SOF community has little familiarity with anything other than a counterterrorism paradigm focused on non-state entities. And at the tactical level, SOF units are preparing for their next deployments in familiar ways with familiar training. Much has changed, and little has changed.  Within the special operations forces, discussions about the meaning and challenges of great-power competition have begun. Yet these discussions remain nascent and abstract. Put simply, special operators increasingly understand that they are supposed to be playing a role in great-power competition, but they often lack a clear understanding of what that really means.  This report seeks to advance and clarify discussions of the SOF role in great-power competition.2 The bureaucratic transition this shift requires will be challenging: Resources will have to be adjusted, roles and missions will have to be recalibrated, and the training and preparation of SOF for future deployments will have to change. These adjustments will only be possible with a sharper sense of what SOF should, and should not, do in this area.  Of course, any discussion of the role of SOF in great-power competition should begin with a recognition that the SOF community is not monolithic. Some SOF units have traditionally focused on direct action; others were originally designed to work with partner forces. Certain units are associated with particular missions, such as airfield seizures; others are the lead actors in hostage rescue and other forms of crisis response. It follows that not every part of the SOF community will or should perform a uniform set of tasks in an era of greatpower competition. The need, in fact, is for more specialization rather than more homogeneity. That caveat aside, SOF do occupy a particular, elite niche in the US Department of Defense and the US national security establishment, so it is possible to offer some general observations about their future role.  We argue that preparing SOF for great-power competition will first require four big shifts in that community: relinquishing the thought leadership that SOF have enjoyed in the global war on terror (GWOT), acknowledging the end of America\u2019s unipolar military doctrine, abandoning the idea that SOF can serve principally as a deterrent capability, and frankly confronting the bureaucratic pathologies that two decades of counterterrorism have entrenched. Once these changes are made, SOF will be well- positioned to support great-power competition in five key ways: gathering information, working with allies and partners, imposing costs on authoritarian rivals, handling crisis response, and undertaking strategic raids. In addition, the SOF community should understand that retaining competency in counterterrorism is itself a crucial contribution to great-power competition, because suppressing non-state threats at a reasonable price is the prerequisite to the rest of the American government focusing its attention on other things.  Great-power competition will be something of a cold shower for the SOF community, not least because elite military units\u2014and perhaps the US military as a whole\u2014will no longer have the starring part in addressing the nation\u2019s greatest strategic challenge. It will require unwinding patterns of training and deployment that have become deeply embedded in the SOF organizational culture. But confronting these issues is crucial if SOF are to help the nation succeed in the defining geopolitical contests of the 21st century.  SOF and the GWOT The era of counterterrorism was the era of SOF. From the outset, special operators were at the forefront of the GWOT. Shortly after 9/11, SOF elements teamed up with CIA paramilitary forces to reenter Afghanistan, link up with the Northern Alliance, and support a concentrated effort against the Taliban. In this endeavor, they brought unique US capabilities such as precision air-delivered fires, surveillance, and intelligence collection. During the early days of the war, SOF also conducted activities to pave the way for the arrival of conventional forces. SOF 2 AMERICAN      operators reduced enemy observation posts, confirmed that landing zones were clear of enemy forces, and assisted with the arrival of conventional ground combat elements.3 During and after the initial invasion, SOF targeted remnants of the Taliban government\u2014which had been shattered by SOF-enabled military operations\u2014 and its paramilitary units, as well as al Qaeda elements operating in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This effort required adopting a counterterrorism approach in which multisource intelligence operations enabled the capture or killing of members of enemy networks, and SOF battled to unravel, destroy, or disrupt such networks. This, in essence, is counterterrorism\u2014 manhunting. And few resources were spared in this effort.  The campaign against al Qaeda in particular quickly evolved into a campaign against regional and global networks, which had the structure, resources, leadership, and inspiration to disrupt US operations and attack the West. The SOF campaign amalgamated interagency intelligence support, built international counterterrorism partnerships, relied on conventional forces in a supporting role, and required freedom of action to move regionally and even globally as collected threads of information identified the next individuals on the capture list. The daring raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in 2011 showed how proficient SOF had become in the counterterrorism fight.4  The 2003 invasion of Iraq provided different challenges. Initially, SOF concentrated on locating and neutralizing suspected Iraqi weapons of mass destruction facilities. Raids against critical nodes in the Iraqi military and command structure weakened their cohesion and contributed to the rapid collapse of Iraqi conventional resistance. After the fall of Baghdad, the United States began to emphasize the capture or elimination of key individuals from Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime. Support and courier networks were identified, and high-value targets were located and captured. When the conflict in Iraq subsequently morphed into an insurgency, fueled by inter-sectarian conflict and the arrival of al Qaeda\u2013linked forces, SOF enhanced their ongoing operations to attack the terrorist networks that were fueling the violence.  As the GWOT spilled from Afghanistan and Iraq into other areas\u2014the Arabian Peninsula, the Levant, the Horn of Africa, and elsewhere\u2014SOF increasingly used the model they had developed to prosecute an expanding fight in new locations. And as the commitment of the United States to manpower-intensive forms of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency waned, SOF became even more central to American efforts, because they offered the possibility of aggressively prosecuting the GWOT without larger, more politically sensitive commitments of US forces.5  SOF were almost everywhere in the GWOT\u2014 and for SOF, almost everything became counterterrorism. Even today, as the future of the forever wars becomes increasingly contested, SOF still fill a vital role. They fracture terrorist networks, pursue key members, and stifle the efforts by these non-state actors to plan, fund, rehearse, and execute attacks. With the intelligence, law enforcement, and homeland security communities, SOF remain integral to the nation\u2019s multilayered warning and security effort. And there is little debate that, so long as the US military has a part in the counterterrorism effort, SOF will be in the lead.  Preparing for Big Changes The world, however, has not stood still, and neither has US foreign policy. Authoritarian rivals exploited America\u2019s period of preoccupation in the greater Middle East to develop their military capabilities and pursue revisionist ambitions. Two US presidents have now argued that the country must shift from a primary emphasis on counterterrorism to a focus on great-power competition. Given SOF\u2019s centrality to the GWOT, this shift represents a stark and disruptive change. For SOF to remain relevant in a new strategic reality, dormant capabilities must be revitalized, new capabilities pursued, and doctrinal adjustments made. All of that first requires changes in mindset and organizational culture. Four particular adjustments are needed.  First, SOF must accept a hard reality: They will not have thought leadership or be the leading edge of American strategy. For nearly two decades, special operations guided the nation\u2019s response to 9/11. The GWOT was organized around kinetic action, with SOF spearheading the critical campaigns. These campaigns, moreover, positioned SOF at the forefront of impressive innovations: intelligence fusion, a counterterrorist targeting cycle, interagency 3 AMERICAN      task forces, partner-force operations, and precision tactical strike capabilities. Aggressive action was essential; progress was measured in body counts, the capture or killing of high-value targets, and the capture of terrain. These results were easily measured and understood by senior officers and politicians, and SOF delivered them daily.  Tactics aligned closely with strategy: Suppressing terrorist groups was a competency at which SOF excelled and became the marker of national success or failure in the GWOT. Whether this approach delivered meaningful long-term progress for the United States is debatable.6 But it undeniably delivered tremendous organizational payoffs for SOF, demonstrated in the rising budget and expanding size of US Special Operations Command.7  Great-power competition will be different. Here, tactical action is, at best, a peripheral aspect of the challenge; the very idea of competition implies that the nation is not yet \u201cat war\u201d in the way it was during the GWOT. That means that SOF will not, and should not, have a leading role in the nation\u2019s strategy.  In competitions that will be determined by the rate of technological innovation and the balance of economic and diplomatic influence, as much as by the balance of military power, other parts of the national security establishment\u2014the Treasury  Department, State Department, intelligence community, and even obscure entities such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States\u2014may now be the tip of the spear. In rivalries characterized by the threat of intense, high-end military conflict, the country\u2019s conventional capabilities, nuclear forces, and military alliances will play the key role in deterring and, if necessary, defeating near-peer powers. The higher stakes and greater diplomatic sensitivities of competitive relationships will push the US government to rely on non-SOF tools, such as covert action and strategic communications, to seek advantage and reduce American vulnerabilities. SOF will still matter in the greatpower competition, but they will find themselves in a supporting rather than a leading role.  Second, SOF leaders must face the fact that America\u2019s period of unmatched primacy has concluded and America\u2019s \u201cunipolar military doctrine\u201d has become outdated. That doctrine featured a linear, phased construct for military operations, beginning with activities such as \u201cshaping,\u201d proceeding to  decisive combat operations, and ending with stabilization and withdrawal of US forces. This was essentially a \u201cgo, win, return\u201d strategy, optimized for conflicts with weaker adversaries and indemnified by seemingly unassailable American advantages. That doctrine also featured a clear distinction among pre-combat, combat, and post-combat activities. None of these characteristics is well matched to an era of enduring contests with powerful rivals.8  Great-power competition not only requires dealing with countries that possess peer or nearpeer capabilities but also features rivals that seek to alter the status quo without triggering a full-scale military response. Only occasionally do challenges of this nature produce clear winners and losers. More often, the result is the subtle increase or decrease in US influence and the gradual strengthening or erosion of America\u2019s position. It is hard to point to a single moment\u2014other than the standoff at Scarborough Shoal in 2012, perhaps\u2014at which the United States suffered a crippling blow in the competition for influence in the South China Sea.9 Yet in 2020, China has undeniably dramatically strengthened its position, mostly through a series of incremental steps.10 You can win or lose greatpower competition on the installment plan. SOF will therefore need a competition mindset rather than a \u201cgo, win, return\u201d approach.  The Joint Chiefs of Staff has pointed the way, with the publication in June 2019 of Joint Doctrine Note 1-19, Competition Continuum. That document acknowledges that the US military \u201cemploys many constructs that reflect an artificial distinction\u201d  between peace and war and describes \u201ca world of enduring competition conducted through a mixture of cooperation, competition below armed conflict, and armed conflict.\u201d The Joint Force will thus need to think in terms of campaigning (an ongoing activity) 4 AMERICAN      rather than campaigns (activities with clear start and end points). It must nest its activities in a broader array of diplomatic, economic, and informational measures meant to strengthen American influence, and it must accept that military aspects of campaigning will represent a complementary  effort rather than the main effort. SOF should also embrace this concept.11  Third, SOF leaders should jettison the idea of using SOF primarily as a deterrent capability vis-\u00e0-vis great-power challengers. Terms such as \u201cunorthodox deterrence\u201d have become prevalent in a SOF community that is seeking to apply its strengths to new strategic problems.12 But these concepts are problematic because they misunderstand both deterrence theory and key tenets of SOF employment. Deterrence is most effective when the target understands the exact consequence of a desired behavior, is able to weigh the consequence against the desired outcome, and chooses whether to act based on a rational understanding of perceived cost/benefit. SOF efforts to conceal operations, achieve moments of relative superiority through surprise, and create disproportionate impact relative to the size of the force are important qualities, but they are not the qualities most needed to deter powerful rivals.  To be sure, an understanding that the United States possesses these capabilities can marginally enhance deterrence in key areas\u2014for example, the Baltic region or the South China Sea\u2014by threatening to raise the costs of aggressive action or otherwise introducing doubt into the minds of potential aggressors. But SOF are only a small part of a much larger package of deterrent capabilities\u2014military, economic, and diplomatic\u2014and thinking of deterrence as a core mission would be a mistake.  Put bluntly, if what the United States primarily wants is deterrence in a place like Eastern Europe, it should be thinking in terms of armored brigade combat teams rather than SEAL teams. Instead, SOF should emphasize their punitive capability and the intentional uncertainty associated with their operations. These are important SOF offerings in great-power competition, but they should not be primarily construed, taught, or trained as deterrence. Finally, SOF leaders will have to frankly acknowledge and aggressively confront one of the most disconcerting impacts of the past two decades: the emergence of formidable bureaucratic and institutional obstacles to change. The more deeply ingrained a particular mission set or organizational ethos becomes, the harder it is to reform, even when reform is what new circumstances require. For example, the Navy has put aircraft carriers and the carrier air wing at the heart of its doctrine and organizational essence for several decades. That once made sense, but more recently it has made it devilishly difficult for that service to admit that carriers bearing short-range, manned aircraft are spectacularly ill-equipped for the hardest fights the United States might face. Inertia has  become the enemy of strategy.  Similarly, the SOF formation is now hampered by the organizational residue of 20 years of the GWOT: capability overlap, excess capacity, and the establishment of intractable micro-economies. These pathologies have developed their own constituencies; leaders in the SOF establishment should expect heavy resistance to reform.  Had the GWOT ended after the initial defeat of al Qaeda and the Taliban in 2001\u201302, the long-term impact on SOF would have been limited. Particular units would have mostly reverted to their pre-9/11 missions and capabilities. Instead, a generational GWOT transformed America\u2019s SOF in ways that have now become deeply entrenched.  SOF units\u2014from West Coast SEAL teams to the Europe-based Special Forces\u2014formally or informally adopted roles beyond their doctrinal missions. In some cases, they took on responsibilities\u2014namely, land-based counterterrorism and kinetic action\u2014 different from those for which they were initially designed. Navy SEALs de-emphasized maritime operations in favor of frequent land-based deployments. Units designed for partner operations took on unilateral operations; units designed for unilateral operations took on partner operations. Additionally, SOF units permanently integrated previously peripheral capabilities (such as intelligence, communications, mobility, and support) to reduce their reliance on adjacent or external units. These changes were often initially implemented in an ad hoc fashion, but they subsequently congealed as a result of generous, tailored funding and years of repetition. As the stars of American strategy in the GWOT, SOF were able to make\u2014and have approved\u2014ambitious requests for growth in people, resources, and capabilities.  5 AMERICAN      This horizontal expansion and overlap of capabilities met an operational need in the GWOT. But the longer-term organizational consequences were often negative. SOF units may be elite, but they cannot be good at everything. Leaders have found it increasingly difficult just to manage their unwieldy units, ultimately dulling the blade they hoped to sharpen. The generation of excess capacity in one mission area also creates deficiencies in others.  The recent United States Special Operations Command Comprehensive Review observed that  leaders developed within training and deployment environments focused solely on COIN [counterinsurgency], CT [counterterrorism], and DA [direct action] core activities\u2014 more specifically, unilateral and foreign partnered raids and execution of the find, fix, finish, exploit, and analyze (F3EA) targeting cycle.  That pattern came at a cost\u2014namely, \u201cperpetuating SOF force structure that focuses on COIN and CT while not developing SOF and SOF leaders for the full spectrum of SOF core activities and Component specific skills and capabilities.\u201d13 Finally, an excess of SOF capability in certain areas creates ambiguity regarding \u201cwho\u201d should do \u201cwhat.\u201d Research reveals a deep-seated identity crisis in the Green Berets\u2014 a force traditionally devoted to unconventional warfare\u2014over what its mission is and should be.14  The GWOT also created another impediment to rapid organizational adjustment: a vast array of microeconomies that can survive only if the status quo is perpetuated. New buildings and training areas have sprung up. Equipment that might have been useful on a one-off basis has been acquired and protected. The SOF supporting establishment, which consists of both civilian officials and contractors, has mushroomed. Senior leaders must accept that some costs are sunk and that some capabilities, training, and support functions will have to be discarded. There will not be real change in how SOF orient themselves without a determined effort to break down micro-economies that are threatened by that reorientation.  What SOF Can Do As these intellectual and organizational challenges are confronted, SOF can make important contributions in great-power competition. There are five key areas in which SOF are positioned to make a difference: getting information, working with allies and partners, imposing costs on authoritarian rivals, responding to crises, and conducting strategic raids.  Getting Information. Great-power competition involves a continuous struggle between competent nation-state adversaries. It also features ongoing interactions in the gray zone\u2014the murky space  between peace and war. That being the case, the requirements for streams of information flowing from the \u201ccontact layer\u201d\u2014the front lines of the geopolitical competition\u2014will profoundly increase.15 SOF can aid policymakers in better understanding sensitive areas of the competitive environment so that Washington can more accurately evaluate policy options and geopolitical trends.  For example, SOF are often in position to observe the attitudes of foreign military forces or note an increase or decrease in popular support for a particular government. SOF gather this information as a byproduct of overseas presence; these observations complement other more systematic efforts the intelligence community manages. In other cases, SOF can use their capabilities for concealment and infiltration to conduct unilateral reconnaissance against key facilities, peoples, or events.  Yet this will mean doing intelligence differently than during the counterterrorism era. After 9/11, SOF developed formidable intelligence capabilities, but they were tightly linked to prior and subsequent military action. One raid generated information that drove the next raid; SOF professionals focused on \u201ctargeting cycles\u201d and \u201csensor-shooter optimization\u201d as the central thrust of the intelligence endeavor.16 In great-power competition, however, the most valuable intelligence may not be actionable in the traditional manner. It may simply contribute to a better understanding of our rivals and the geopolitical battlegrounds on which we compete with them. Similarly, after 9/11, SOF generated intelligence for which they then served as the consumer. In greatpower competition, SOF will collect intelligence that may not guide their own actions so much as they support a broader national strategy.  This is not to say that SOF intelligence efforts should supplant the intelligence community\u2019s ongoing work. Instead, SOF will need to retool to better 6 AMERICAN      contribute to the strategic intelligence picture.  Observation and reporting are already integral to SOF culture; the bigger challenges are organizational and bureaucratic. In particular, it will be crucial to refine the tasking and reporting channels that connect SOF to the intelligence community. The special operations world will also need to reevaluate the role of intelligence commands in the formation. These commands have been tasked with collecting, analyzing, and organizing targeting information for SOF use; certain capabilities will now need to be realigned against emerging great-power threats rather than receding terrorist challenges.  Finally, SOF will need better counterintelligence and operations security. Collecting information against great-power competitors is like the NBA, not college ball. Nation-state adversaries have repeatedly demonstrated their effectiveness in penetrating and reporting on US activities overseas. SOF, like the intelligence community, will need to shift the way they operate to deal with this threat.  Working with Allies and Partners. The imperative of working with partners has often been a source of frustration for SOF during the GWOT. In the context of great-power competition, working with allies and partners is likely to be where SOF contribute the most. The United States enjoys a multitiered system of ties with friendly foreign actors\u2014 formal treaty allies, non-allied partners, and nonstate and irregular forces. At each level, SOF can help the United States get the most out of these relationships.  At the level of alliances, SOF elements already train with professional forces from allied nations, share lessons and innovation, and stand ready to join them in combat if the alliance is threatened. After two decades of fighting next to one another in various coalitions, these relationships are strong and resilient. In great-power competition, SOF from allied nations will form the foundation for  cooperation on various military operations. This is an area in which SOF can strengthen the military linkages and working relationships that bind together America\u2019s unrivaled geopolitical network.  At the level of non-allied partners, SOF can simultaneously build US influence and improve the ability of friendly nations to resist coercion. Improving the capabilities of Ukrainian forces that are resisting Russian aggression makes life harder for Moscow. Working with foreign militaries in regions where competition is intensifying creates channels for US political influence.17 Admittedly, working with nonallied partners in Iraq and Afghanistan has proved enormously complex over the past two decades, due to profound disparities in capabilities, culture, and\u2014in some instances\u2014national interests. Yet the struggle for influence in partner and non-allied nations will form a vital component of competition. So this basic undertaking is here to stay, even if particular partnerships evolve or fade over time.  Finally, SOF remain connected to non-state and irregular forces. These partnerships (for example, with the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF) emerged when the interests of the United States and the non-state entity in question were aligned. In some cases, specific partnerships may carry over into great-power competition: The SDF have utility in limiting Russian influence in northeastern Syria as well as in preventing an ISIS resurgence. In other cases, the United States will build new partnerships, perhaps with irregular forces that oppose the expansion of Russia or Chinese influence in some contested area.  Yet these partnerships will mostly remain transactional and time limited. That being the case, SOF will need additional training to carefully work with non-state partners and adhere to the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act definition of \u201cactivities in support of predetermined United States policy and military objectives conducted by, with, and through regular forces, irregular forces, groups, and individuals participating in competition between state and non-state actors short of traditional armed conflict.\u201d18  Imposing Costs. Gathering information and working with allies and partners can contribute to a third SOF competency\u2014imposing costs on authoritarian competitors. Cost imposition is not, strictly speaking, a specific tactic, in the way that reconnaissance or a strategic raid are. It is a result of actions that can take a wide variety of forms. Cost imposition, moreover, should not be seen as a catchall category into which SOF can cram any effort to participate. Yet because cost imposition is central to greatpower competition, and because the concept has come into vogue in the SOF community, it bears discussion.19  7 AMERICAN      Cost imposition simply refers to the idea of creating friction around an opponent\u2019s activities, raising the price that opponent must pay for aggressive  behavior, and otherwise imposing a competitive \u201ctax\u201d on actions that the United States opposes. In competitions that can last for years or decades, cost imposition is fundamental to successful strategy, because even modest costs that are imposed today can compound exponentially over time.  Most of the cost imposition that the United States will pursue in great-power competition will be nonmilitary in nature, yet SOF are nonetheless well-placed to contribute to cost-imposing campaigns. Sensitive, unilateral reconnaissance activities can expose malign conduct by a competitor and thus increase the diplomatic or political costs that competitor must pay. Improving the defensive or intelligence capabilities of a partner nation that is being coerced by a hostile great power can allow that country to exact a higher price on the adversary. Quietly sabotaging the capabilities or facilities of a competitor that is engaged in gray-zone aggression is itself a form of cost imposition. If relations between the United States and its challengers worsen in the coming years, which currently seems quite likely, there may arise still other possibilities.  As these hypothetical examples indicate, debates around cost imposition are often fraught and difficult. This is because activities that might impose the greatest costs on an adversary, and perhaps eventually shift the decision calculus of that adversary, may be beyond the risk tolerance of officials who seek to wage competition without plunging into confrontation. That is a constraint SOF simply have to live with.  It is not the SOF community\u2019s role to offer policy advice to elected and appointed officials, much less to set the country\u2019s political or strategic objectives through the options it offers. Cost imposition can produce unwanted consequences, so discussions of how SOF can contribute to cost imposition require a nuanced understanding of political objectives, a realistic assessment of capabilities, and an honest appraisal of risk. Sensitive missions do sometimes fail, but the last thing the SOF community should want is to put itself in the position of having advocated an undertaking that fails or backfires because the community\u2019s enthusiasm outran its capabilities or influenced its risk assessment.  With all these cautions in mind, however, SOF can constructively affect deliberations regarding how and whether to undertake particular cost-imposing efforts. By illuminating for policymakers what options are available at a given level of risk\u2014 what Washington can do to increase the price of Chinese expansionism in the South China Sea or Russian aggression in Ukraine and what dangers accompany these actions\u2014SOF can better inform debates about what the United States is trying to achieve and how far it should be willing to go.  Crisis Response. The strategic focus on American foreign policy may change, but the reality of unwelcome surprises and fast-breaking crises will not. In the GWOT era, crisis response revolved around high-value targets, emergent threats, or other fleeting opportunities to advance US interests. In the era of great-power competition, a variety of  unexpected crises could challenge the United States. Washington could face a Russian or Chinese seizure of an American vessel in disputed waters, similar to Russia\u2019s seizure of a Ukrainian vessel in 2018.21 There might emerge a threat to US citizens or diplomatic personnel, created by internal instability or civil conflict in a region of strategic contestation among the great powers, such as Sub-Saharan Africa. In other cases, the United States might confront crises that do not directly implicate Russia and China but nonetheless threaten enduring American interests\u2014for example, a renewed nuclear crisis involving Iran or a different counter-proliferation challenge.  These crises are different than those that primarily characterized the GWOT era; in some cases, they will pit the United States against adversaries far more formidable than it faced in the post-9/11 8 AMERICAN      era. Fortunately, SOF culture reinforces characteristics that are broadly helpful in various crisis- response scenarios: empowered individuals and flattened decision-making structures, truncated response times, extraordinary strategic mobility, and mature tactical skills. Not all SOF units should be involved in crisis response, which should continue to be the mandate of the most elite parts of that community. But for those units that are involved, crisis response will remain a mainstay, and it will require updating and resourcing relevant capabilities.  The Strategic Raid. The greatest military challenge the United States faces is the emergence of dense, sophisticated networks of anti-access and area denial (A2/AD) capabilities wielded by authoritarian challengers. In 2012, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta openly confronted the threat, directing the military to \u201cinvest as required to ensure its ability to operate effectively in anti-access and area denial environments.\u201d22 Yet nearly a decade later, A2/AD still presents profound operational problems and poses a significant threat to America\u2019s ability to defend its forward-most allies.23 Here there is a particularly important role for SOF in allowing the United States to operate in a contested environment: the strategic raid.  The strategic raid is different from crisis response, in which the need for and parameters of action are normally shaped by the enemy. A strategic raid, rather, involves a deliberate, planned effort to access a target, conduct a tactical military action, and then depart. In many cases\u2014such as the attempt to rescue US hostages in Iran in 1980 or to kill Osama bin Laden in 2011\u2014these raids feature high-risk infiltration, the creation of a moment of relative military superiority against a larger enemy force, and a planned withdrawal. In the context of great-power competition, strategic raids might be used to neutralize key aspects of an enemy A2/AD network, thereby allowing a larger force to operate with increased freedom or to eliminate a target that would otherwise consume large numbers of scarce munitions\u2014 such as precision-guided, standoff munitions\u2014 that are badly needed elsewhere. The strategic raid could also offer a means of targeting key enemy capabilities, facilities, individuals, or vulnerabilities  relatively quietly, an approach that might appeal to American policymakers who are wary of unwanted escalation.  Strategic raids are inherently challenging, especially against peer or near-peer competitors. In addition to the significant military risks, high levels of political risk are often associated with such operations. As a result, not all SOF units will be equipped or responsible for strategic raids, which will occur less frequently than they did during the GWOT. But for precisely these reasons, the capability for strategic raids must reside in SOF. And that capability will not be easily acquired or maintained: The evolution of strategic raid forces will require substantial resource and training investments to meet new challenges in counterintelligence, cyber detection, and near-peer response capabilities. Absent additional investment in SOF strategic raid capabilities, it will become harder for US decision makers to  authorize such missions, because near-peer capabilities challenge access, shrink the moments of relative superiority, and increase the associated military and political risk. Conclusion SOF can contribute to great-power competition in one final area: maintaining excellence in counterterrorism, not across the entire community, but in key parts of it. Although US counterterrorism efforts are ebbing, they have not stopped. The toxic mix of instability and radicalism in many countries in the Middle East and beyond ensures that the threat is not going away, even if America\u2019s strategic focus is\u2014and should be\u2014shifting away.  Terror networks will need to be detected and countered. Imperfect partners will require continued assistance in confronting security challenges. If the United States fails to maintain an acceptable level of suppression in the counterterrorism fight, new attacks will occur, and the country will once again fail to reorient its attention and resources to more important, if less urgent, tasks. Keeping a lid on the counterterrorism problem, at an acceptable level of investment, is thus a precondition to the broader strategic shift the US national security  establishment must execute. By guarding against \u201cold\u201d dangers, SOF can help the country focus on \u201cnew\u201d ones.24  9 AMERICAN      So some portion of SOF must continue to manage the counterterrorism effort, even if suppression of the terrorist blight can and must be accomplished with shrinking numbers, increasing efficiencies, and the moderately higher degree of risk that accompanies these changes. The objective will be to manage rather than conclusively defeat a dangerous threat\u2014 to prevent that threat from dangerously expanding or intensifying while managing the use of resources to avoid jeopardizing interests elsewhere.25  But the SOF mindset of \u201ceveryone gets a taste of counterterrorism\u201d must end, so that other elements of the formation can be pulled from counterterrorism rotations to begin prioritizing core competencies for missions tailored to great-power competition. Put simply, if SOF writ large is conducting a broader variety of missions in an era of greatpower competition, there will have to be a stricter division of labor in that community. The formation will increasingly need to be bifurcated between those units that specialize in \u201cold\u201d competencies and those that specialize in \u201cnew\u201d ones.  About the Authors Some in the SOF community argue against this move toward specialization or contend that SOF capabilities are so advanced that they should remain central to American strategy in the era of greatpower competition. These perspectives reflect where SOF are in the present rather than where they should be in the future. Today, these forces are  optimized for a rotational counterterrorism fight, horizontally integrated with a panoply of supporting capabilities, and filled by individuals selected,  assessed, and trained for the forever wars. Tomorrow, SOF will need to develop distinct selection and training pathways, shed excess capacity and mission overlap, and reinforce and provide resources for diverse mission sets.  Most of all, SOF leaders will need to acknowledge the misalignment and disparities between counterterrorism capacity and great-power competition capacity.

This includes training, sharing lessons and innovations, and working with irregular forces to resist coercion from authoritarian powers.\n\n3. **Imposing Costs on Adversaries:** To effectively impose costs, SOF should focus on actions that create friction for adversaries' operations and increase their operational costs, such as through sabotage or by bolstering the defense capabilities of partner nations.\n\n4. **Crisis Response:** SOF need to maintain their rapid response capabilities to handle emerging crises, which requires keeping elite units prepared and ensuring they have the necessary resources and training to respond to a wide range of scenarios.\n\n5. **Conducting Strategic Raids:** Preparing for strategic raids against high-value targets within contested environments demands specialized training, technology upgrades, and a focus on evolving tactics to overcome sophisticated anti-access and area denial (A2/AD) systems of near-peer adversaries.\n\nAcross these areas, SOF will need to adapt their training, equipment, and strategic thinking to meet the challenges of great-power competition, balancing their renowned counterterrorism capabilities with the necessities of geopolitical strategizing and high-intensity conflict preparedness."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How does this contrast with what SOF are already doing?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The shift in Strategic Operations Forces (SOF) focus towards intelligence gathering, building alliances, imposing costs, crisis response, and conducting strategic raids in the context of great-power competition represents an evolution from their post-9/11 counterterrorism activities. Here's how it contrasts with what SOF have traditionally been doing:\n\n1. **From Counterterrorism to Broader Intelligence Gathering**: Previously, SOF intelligence efforts were heavily focused on actionable intelligence for counterterrorism\u2014identifying, tracking, and neutralizing terrorist networks and high-value targets. The shift towards great-power competition requires broader intelligence gathering, focused not just on immediate threats but on understanding the strategic intentions, capabilities, and activities of state adversaries like China and Russia.\n\n2. **Building Alliances and Partnerships Beyond Counterterrorism**: While SOF have long worked with allies and partners, the focus has primarily been on counterterrorism cooperation. The new emphasis involves deeper military-to-military relationships and capacity-building with a wider array of partners, including state forces in strategic regions, to counteract the influence of major power adversaries, not just non-state terrorist groups.\n\n3. **Imposing Costs on State Adversaries**: Previously, SOF's role in imposing costs was mainly about direct action and raids against terrorist networks, disrupting their operations. Now, the concept expands to include broader actions like cyber operations, information warfare, and other indirect ways to challenge and impose costs on state adversaries, which require different sets of skills and strategic thinking.\n\n4. **Crisis Response in a Strategic Context**: While SOF have always been at the forefront of crisis response due to their rapid deployment capabilities, the nature of crises in a great-power competition framework is different. It may involve responding to provocations or actions by state actors in strategically sensitive regions, necessitating not just tactical response but also strategic calibration to avoid escalation with major powers.\n\n5. **Conducting Strategic Raids with Higher Stakes**: While SOF are adept at precision raids and targeted operations, such actions in the context of great-power competition carry different risks and implications. Raids may target sophisticated A2/AD environments or involve operations with higher political and military stakes, requiring more complex planning, better technology, and a deeper understanding of the strategic calculus of state adversaries.\n\nOverall, the contrast lies in the transition from a primary focus on counterterrorism\u2014a largely tactical and operational challenge against non-state actors\u2014to preparing for and engaging in a strategic competition with state adversaries, which demands a broader set of capabilities, a shift in mindset, and an understanding of complex geopolitical dynamics."}, {"role": "user", "content": "do you have any recommendations on how SOF can undertake the several key actions you mentioned?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To effectively undertake the key actions necessitated by their shifting focus towards great-power competition, Special Operations Forces (SOF) could consider the following recommendations:\n\n### 1. Enhancing Intelligence Gathering:\n- **Integrate with other Intelligence Communities (IC):** SOF should work closely with national and allied intelligence agencies to share insights and leverage broader intelligence-gathering networks.\n- **Invest in Language and Cultural Training:** Developing language skills and cultural understanding will be crucial for operating effectively in diverse geopolitical environments.\n- **Adopt Advanced Surveillance Technologies:** Utilize cutting-edge technology for intelligence gathering, such as artificial intelligence (AI) for data analysis and unmanned systems for surveillance.\n\n### 2. Building Alliances and Partnerships:\n- **Strengthen Interoperability:** Conduct joint exercises and training programs with allied and partner military forces to enhance interoperability and foster mutual understanding.\n- **Establish Military Liaison Elements:** Deploy military liaison elements to work directly within embassies and with foreign militaries to deepen strategic ties and facilitate rapid coordination.\n- **Capacity Building Initiatives:** Focus on training and equipping partner forces, emphasizing not just tactical proficiency but also areas such as cyber defense and intelligence operations.\n\n### 3. Imposing Costs on Adversaries:\n- **Develop Asymmetric Capabilities:** Innovate in areas where SOF can create strategic dilemmas for adversaries, such as cyber warfare, electronic warfare, and information operations.\n- **Strategic Sabotage:** Prepare for operations that discreetly undermine adversaries' strategic capabilities, ensuring that such actions are carefully calibrated to avoid unwanted escalation.\n- **Leverage Unconventional Warfare Tactics:** Training in and preparation for unconventional warfare can enable SOF to assist local resistance movements in contesting adversary control in occupied areas.\n\n### 4. Crisis Response:\n- **Enhance Rapid Deployment Capabilities:** Ensure that SOF units can deploy quickly with the necessary support and logistics for a variety of crisis scenarios.\n- **Scenario-Based Training:** Conduct regular training that simulates a range of crisis scenarios, from hostage situations to deterring aggressive state actions, to ensure readiness.\n- **Integrate with Diplomatic Strategies:** SOF operations in crises should be closely coordinated with diplomatic efforts to ensure that military actions support broader strategic objectives.\n\n### 5. Conducting Strategic Raids:\n- **Advanced Operational Planning:** Employ virtual and augmented reality tools in planning phases to simulate complex environments and enhance mission planning accuracy.\n- **Invest in Stealth and Low-Detection Technologies:** Prioritize technologies that reduce detectability and enhance the element of surprise in contested environments.\n- **Inter-Agency Coordination:** Ensure that strategic raids are coordinated with efforts by other government agencies for intelligence support and to manage potential political fallout.\n\n### Cross-Cutting Recommendations:\n- **Continuous Learning and Adaptation:** Encourage a culture of continuous learning, allowing SOF to adapt to emerging threats and technologies.\n- **Strategic Communication:** Develop capabilities in strategic communication to counter adversaries' information operations and to support U.S. narrative in contested regions.\n- **Legal and Ethical Training:** Given the complex legal and ethical considerations in Great power competition, ensure that all SOF personnel are well-versed in these aspects.\n\nImplementing these actions will require balanced investment in technology, training, and strategic partnerships. It will also necessitate an adaptive mindset among SOF units\u2014to not only preserve their counterterrorism excellence but to evolve and thrive in the complex landscape of great-power competition."}, {"role": "user", "content": "can you condense everything you have told me so far into about one paragraph?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Special Operations Forces (SOF) are transitioning from a primary focus on counterterrorism to engaging in great-power competition, notably against state adversaries like China and Russia.

To succeed, SOF must integrate more closely with intelligence and allied forces, adopt advanced technologies for stealth and surveillance, focus on inter-agency coordination, and continuously adapt to new challenges through scenario-based training and investment in language, cultural, and legal-ethical training.

This includes deepening relationships with allies through increased interoperability and shared training exercises that expand SOF capabilities into new domains like cyber and information warfare. By focusing on building robust alliances and partnerships, SOF can leverage a global network of cooperative defense efforts to counter the expanding influence of major power adversaries.\n\nMoreover, SOF must refine their approach to imposing strategic costs on adversaries, employing asymmetric capabilities and strategic sabotage to challenge opponents subtly and effectively. The ability to respond rapidly to crises, supported by advanced planning tools and stealth technologies, will enable SOF to manage emerging threats in hotspots around the world. Conducting strategic raids in contested environments demands a high degree of precision, necessitating investments in technology and inter-agency coordination to ensure success while minimizing risks of escalation. This adaptive approach, coupled with an emphasis on continuous learning, strategic communication, and a strong understanding of legal and ethical considerations, positions SOF to effectively navigate the complexities of great-power competition, ensuring their relevance and effectiveness on the modern geopolitical stage."}]}, {"facetValue": "summarize an article about surgical team learning and the factors influencing it.

I know many of you have spent your whole life trying to get to the middle class, and I am about to tell\nyou it is the wrong goal. Have an open mind. I am going to write an entire book\non this topic one day\u2014but for now, let's just think about breaking out of what I\ncall the \u201cmiddle-class mentality.\u201d I believe I can make the case that the middle\nclass is the group hurt most by its members' thinking and actions\u2014leaving\nthemselves to be the most susceptible to insecurity and pain. Although this is a\ngroup that many people aspire to be a part of, it's also the group that seems the\nmost trapped, manipulated, and at risk. Is the middle class really as good a status\nas you've been made to believe? Do you even know what it means to be middle\nclass or what puts a person in this group? Before you make a decision about\nwhere you are going or the group you're striving to belong to, it would be wise to\ninspect the statistics of that group. The Incomes of the Middle Class\nReports from Wikipedia and the 2008 Census suggest that the middle-class\nincome range is somewhere between $35,000 to $50,000 per year. Read another\nset of studies, and these figures are between $22,000 and $65,000 per year. It's\nno secret that it would be extremely difficult to live on either of these income\nlevels in an urban area like New York or LA\u2014much less feel financially secure.\nThis experience is not what most people would consider a desirable situation.\nThe middle class is further divided into the upper and lower middle class. The\nupper middle class usually consists of people who have substantial assets and\nhousehold earnings of over $1 million per year, although there is nothing to\nsubstantiate what makes $1 million the mark. I guess it just sounds good. Most\npeople consider $1 million to be a lot of money\u2014until they have it. Then they\nrealize that it doesn't go very far since a person's decisions and considerations\ntend to change once he or she enters a new income bracket."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Rethinking the Middle-Class Goal\n\n- **Middle-Class Mentality Critique**\n  - Advised to reconsider aspiring for middle-class status as the ultimate goal.\n  - Suggests middle-class mentality may lead to insecurity and pain.\n\n- **Trapped and Manipulated**\n  - Middle class viewed as most susceptible to being trapped, manipulated, and at risk.\n  \n- **Income Range Confusion**\n  - Varied reports on middle-class income: $35,000 to $50,000 or $22,000 to $65,000 yearly.\n  - High cost of living in urban areas challenges financial security at these income levels.\n\n- **Upper vs Lower Middle Class**\n  - Upper middle class defined by assets and earnings over $1 million/year.\n  - Critique on the perceived value of $1 million, suggesting it may not suffice for financial security.\n  \n- **Call to Action**\n  - Encourages examining the statistics and realities of middle-class status.\n  - Highlights the importance of understanding what defines middle-class and questioning its value as a life goal.\n\n### Key Takeaway\n- Urges a reevaluation of aiming for middle-class status, highlighting issues of financial security, societal perceptions, and the varying definitions of income levels within this group."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I want you to act as Summarizing Expert and obsidian notes taking expert I would give you a Paragraph And you would make notes for my obsidian note taking app from it. Summarize this text and just give me a notes with headlining for my Obsidian Note taking app all the key insight and facts in bullet points.  The people in the supposed upper middle class occupy noticeably higher\npositions in their offices and are considered financially more stable than many of\ntheir peers. This may very well be the case\u2014until any sort of economic\ndestruction occurs. Then we tend to see that even this group is unprotected.\nAdmittedly, members of this group should experience a considerable rise in their\nincomes due to the economic growth of the nation in good times. They have\nhigher disposable incomes than many of their counterparts in the lower middle\nclass, which consists of people who have basic educational qualifications and an\nannual income of between $30,000 and $60,000. The lower middle class\nconstitutes a large part of our country's total population. This set frequently\nstruggles to reach the upper middle class's level; however, when economic\nhardship takes hold, everyone gets pulled down.\nA client of mine recently asked me via text message on the 26th of a recent\nmonth, \u201cGrant, I have to net $10,000 to keep my doors open this month. How\ncan I do this?\u201d I happened to get his message during a Sunday football game, so\nI asked him, \u201cAre you watching the game today?\u201d He texted me back, \u201cYes.\u201d I\nthen replied, \u201cWhat are you doing taking a Sunday off to watch the game?! You\nshould be out distributing fliers, spending every second of every hour trying to\ncreate income in excess of what you need. And by the way, you need $100,000\nin net profits\u2014not $10,000.\u201d \u201cSunday,\u201d he responded, \u201cis a day of rest.\u201d Oh boy.\nI shot back, \u201cIt is for those that worked the other six days! The Lord wasn't\ntalking to the people who are short on funds and haven't earned the day of rest.\nSo turn off the game, get off your couch, and go get the money you need! Quit\nbeing a middle-class slave, and go create the income you need to secure wealth\nand financial freedom\u2014for yourself and your household and your company!\u201d I\nthink he got the message.\nMy client is at risk because he has been operating based on what he needs and\ntherefore is just \u201cgetting by.\u201d Unfortunately, this middle-class mentality will not\ncreate financial security. The banks dried up on him; he could no longer depend\non credit for his cushion, and he can now depend only on his actions. This is the\nproblem with many members of the middle class. They go after what they've\ndeemed necessary rather than ever going really big. Most people believe that a\ncomfortable middle-class life includes clothes, a house, a few cars, vacation\ntime, maybe an upper-management position, and some money in the bank.\nHowever, depending on the period in history to which we're referring, the term\n\u201cmiddle class\u201d has had a variety of meanings\u2014many of which have been and still are quite contradictory. It has referred to the class of people between\npeasants and nobility, whereas other definitions suggest that the middle class had\nenough capital to rival nobles. We've clearly come a long way from that meaning\ntoday. For example, in India, the middle class is considered to be those who\nreside in an owner-occupied property, whereas a blue-collar job makes you\nmiddle class in the United States\u2014and in Europe, that makes you a member of\nthe working class."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Upper Middle Class Vulnerability & Middle-Class Mentality\n\n- **Upper Middle Class Characteristics**\n  - Higher office positions, financial stability.\n  - Vulnerable in economic downturns despite higher disposable income.\n\n- **Lower Middle Class Struggles**\n  - Basic education, annual income $30,000 to $60,000.\n  - Majority of the population, aspiring for upper middle class yet often pulled down by economic hardships.\n\n- **Client Case Study: Misguided Financial Priorities**\n  - Example of a client needing to net $10,000 to stay afloat.\n  - Advised against complacency (e.g., watching Sunday football) when in financial need.\n  - Emphasized need for proactive income generation beyond immediate needs.\n\n- **Middle-Class Mentality Critique**\n  - Highlights complacency as a risk to financial security.\n  - Criticizes reliance on credit and minimalistic financial goals.\n  - Advocates for significant ambition over contentment with middle-class comfort.\n\n- **Historical and Geographical Context of Middle Class**\n  - Definition has evolved: once between peasants and nobility, now differs by region.\n  - In India, associated with homeownership; in the U.S., tied to blue-collar jobs; in Europe, considered working class.\n\n### Key Takeaway\n- Both upper and lower middle classes face vulnerabilities, particularly during economic downturns. The critique emphasizes the dangers of the middle-class mentality, advocating for aggressive financial goals and actions to achieve true financial security. The concept of middle class varies greatly by time period and geography, affecting perceptions and financial strategies."}]}, {"facetValue": "extract questions from a document.

Look no further! In this chapter, we will show the types of questions you should expect to face in a quantitative job interview. Building on this, in the next chapter we will give you primers for Mathematical Finance, Econometrics and Statistics, which will cover some basics all prospective Quantitative Analysts must be familiar with.\n\nMany of the questions in this chapter do not relate to quantitative finance in any kind of direct way. However, they are designed to test your ability to think through quantitative problems. These questions demonstrate that being an effective Quantitative Analyst does not simply equate to having detailed knowledge of complex formulas. Rather, you need to be able to think on your feet, and these questions test that ability.\n\nKnow that almost all of your interview questions will relate in some form to mathematics, statistics, econometrics or programming.  Think of interviewing as an opportunity to demonstrate how many skills you have accrued in these areas. Do not be upset if there is some area covered in an interview question that you\u2019ve never been exposed to\u2014the goal is not to demonstrate that you know everything. It is to demonstrate that you know a lot, and you know how to work with the knowledge that you do have. Keep your answers focused, but include relevant techniques you might incorporate into solving a problem, and be prepared to explain how you\u2019d use such methods.\n\nHere\u2019s an example. Are you being asked to value a customized stock option?  Talk about the valuation framework, and how you might forecast future prices using a Monte Carlo simulation technique.  (What type of drift and volatility process will your simulation incorporate?)  Remember that you should be prepared to fully detail any concept you mention during a conversation.  Don\u2019t use the phrases \u201cMarkov process\u201d, \u201crisk-neutral measure\u201d or \u201cBayesian inference\u201d unless you\u2019re prepared to explain these topics.   Even if you don\u2019t answer a specific question correctly, talking about other concepts you\u2019re familiar with during the interview process may give you an opportunity to \u201credeem\u201d yourself.\n\nAnd don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions, too!  An intelligent question\u2014whether about how something is modeled, how portfolio risk is calculated, or how an asset is valued can go a long way to proving that you are the type of employee who will be engaged and willing to go the extra step to solve unanswered questions or improve an existing process.\n\nBasic Personality/Standard Interview Questions\nIn any interview, expect the hiring manager to request that you \u201cwalk\u201d them through your resume. The interviewer may be asking you this because he or she did not have time to read through your resume before meeting you. Or, he or she may want to see which areas of your background you choose to focus on, and how effectively you communicate.  Either way, this is your opportunity to show why your past experience makes you a fit for this job.  Emphasize any classwork, projects, work or teaching experience that is relevant to the Quant world.\n\nNote that for non-technical questions, it is not just the content of your responses that matters\u2014just as important is the manner in which you verbalize them.  Are you confident?  Are you at a loss for words?  Be quick on your feet, but be thoughtful as well.\n\nSome other questions in this area might include:\n\nTell me something about yourself that is not listed on your resume.\nWhat is the riskiest thing you\u2019ve ever done?\nAre you more risk-averse or risk-seeking?  Give me an example.\nWhat is your greatest weakness?\nHow do you feel about waking up early or staying up late?\nWhat are your interests outside the classroom/office?\nWhy should we hire you?\nWhat is your favorite class that you took?\nWho has personally influenced you the most?  Name someone whom you\u2019ve never met who\u2019s been a strong influence.\nTell me about your biggest failure or a period of adversity.\nDiscuss a difficult ethical decision you recently faced.\nWhat\u2019s the last book you read?\nBrainteasers/Quantitative  Interview Questions\nAs we mentioned, most interview questions will relate in some form to mathematics, statistics, econometrics or computer programming.  You may get finance-specific questions if you\u2019ve studied finance at university or worked in finance before, but the main goal of the interview will be to determine your ability to think through quantitative concepts.   Don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions if you need help, and just as you would in school, when you are faced with challenging questions given in this chapter, always show your work, and explain your thought process.\n\nHere are some examples.\n\nIF YOU LOOK AT A CLOCK AND THE TIME IS 12:15, WHAT IS THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE HOUR AND THE MINUTE HAND?\nWe know that at 12:15 the angle is slightly less than \u00bc.  Why?  Because the hour hand needs to move from \u201c12\u201d to \u201c1\u201d over the course of an hour, the hour hand is a little past 12 (and thus the angle is a bit less than 90).  Start off with the basics \u2013 a clock, which is a circle, is 360 degrees.\n\nEach hour on the clock represents 30 degrees (360 degree clock divided by 12 hours).\n\nNow, the minute hand has only moved \u00bc of the way through the hour (the minute hand is at 15, which is \u00bc of the way around), so the hour hand has moved 7.5 degrees (30 degrees per hour times \u00bc move in the minute hand). Now we know the hour hand moved 7.5 degrees, so the answer is 82.5 degrees (90-7.5).\n\nA CAR TRAVELS A DISTANCE OF 60 MILES AT AN AVERAGE SPEED OF 30 MPH. HOW FAST WOULD THE CAR HAVE TO TRAVEL FOR THE SAME 60 MILE DISTANCE HOME TO AVERAGE 60 MPH OVER THE ENTIRE TRIP?\nThis is a trick question:  it\u2019s impossible.  The first trip took 2 hours (60 miles / 30 mph).  In order for you to average 60 mph over the entire trip you would have to travel for 2 hours (120 miles / 60 mph).  Since you already were driving for 2 hours it is impossible for you to average 60mph for the entire trip.\n\nHOW MANY HERSHEY\u2019S CHOCOLATE BARS WERE SOLD IN THE US LAST YEAR?\nVariants on a theme include: how many gallons of ice cream were sold in the U.S., how many fax machines are in use in NYC\u2026or anything else that requires you to extrapolate from a limited set of information.  One of the many possible approaches is to start by looking at the total U.S. population, dividing the population into the most relevant age groups, estimating the \u201cconsuming habit,\u201d etc., and assigning a consuming frequency for each group, before summing to arrive at the total market size.   Start with the fact that the U.S. population is approximately 330 million (the population in Manhattan is 1.6mm; check the figures for the city in which you\u2019re interviewing).  Here, the answer will not matter so much as your thought process.  Include seasonal impacts\u2014more chocolate bars may be bought on Valentine\u2019s Day and Halloween, so add in the fact that consumption is not evenly distributed throughout the year.  Chocolate bars are mostly consumed by people between ages 5  and 70; each of these people may consume approximately 12 to 20 chocolate bars a year\u2026\n\nYOU HAVE A FIVE-GALLON JUG AND A THREE-GALLON JUG. YOU MUST OBTAIN EXACTLY FOUR GALLONS OF WATER. HOW WILL YOU DO IT?\nFill the five-gallon jug and then pour it into the three-gallon jug. The five-gallon jug has 2 gallons left. Now throw the three-gallon water away. Pour the 2 gallons from the five-gallon jug to the three-gallon jug. So now the three-gallon jug has just 2 gallons of water. Fill the five-gallon jug again, and pour 1 gallon to the three-gallon jug. You are then left with 4 gallons of water in the five-gallon jug.\n\nYOU ARE FACED WITH TWO DOORS. ONE DOOR LEADS TO YOUR JOB OFFER (THAT\u2019S THE ONE YOU WANT!), AND THE OTHER LEADS TO THE EXIT. IN FRONT OF EACH DOOR IS A GUARD. ONE GUARD ALWAYS TELLS THE TRUTH. THE OTHER ALWAYS LIES. YOU CAN ASK ONE QUESTION TO DECIDE WHICH DOOR IS THE CORRECT ONE. WHAT WILL YOU ASK?\nAsk a guard: \u201cIf I were to ask you if this door were the correct one, what would you say?\u201d The truthful consultant would answer yes (if it\u2019s the correct one), or no (if it\u2019s not). Now take the lying consultant. If you asked the liar if the correct door is the right way, he would answer no. But if you ask him: \u201cIf I were to ask you if this door were the correct one, what would you say?\u201d he would be forced to lie about how he would answer, and say yes.\n\nAlternatively, you could ask one of the guards whether the other guard would say that Door 1 is the correct door to enter. If you ask the lying guard, he will lie about what the other guard would say. Alternatively, if you ask the truthful guard, he would honestly tell you what the other guard would say, which will be a lie. In either case, chose the other door\u2014whichever door is not indicated by the response to your question.\n\nYOU ARE PLAYING A CARD GAME AGAINST ONE OPPONENT. THE GAME STARTS WITH 21 CARDS ON A TABLE. YOU AND YOUR OPPONENT ALTERNATE TURNS, AND DURING EACH TURN, A PLAYER MAY PICK UP 1, 2 OR 3 CARDS. THE WINNER IS THE PERSON THAT PICKS UP THE LAST CARD. YOU GO FIRST. WHAT IS YOUR FIRST MOVE, AND WHAT IS THE OPTIMAL STRATEGY TO WIN THIS GAME?\nYou pick 1 card first (leaving 20), then you want to respond to all opponent picks by picking a number that totals 4 combined with their last pick. So, you pick 1. Then, if they pick 3, you pick 1\u2026if they pick 2, you pick 2\u2026if they pick 1, you pick 3. This ensures that you\u2019re always leaving them with a multiple of 4 (first 20, then 16, 12, 8, 4), right until the end, when you leave them with exactly 4. When they\u2019re stuck with 4, they are out of luck, because regardless if they pick 1, 2 or 3, you will be able to win in the next turn.\n\nYOU ARE GIVEN 9 MARBLES THAT LOOK THE SAME, BUT 1 OF THEM WEIGHS SLIGHTLY LESS THAN THE OTHER 8. YOU ARE ALSO GIVEN A BALANCE SCALE. WHAT IS THE LEAST NUMBER OF TIMES YOU COULD USE THE BALANCE TO DETERMINE WHICH OF THE MARBLES IS THE LIGHTER ONE? (ALSO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENT BALANCE WEIGHTINGS YOU WOULD PERFORM).\nOn the first weighing, you would weigh three marbles on each side, leaving three off. If one side of the scale is lighter, you are left with three marbles. Then you would place one marble on each side of scale, and leave one off.  This method will identify the light marble while only performing two weightings in total.\n\nFOUR PEOPLE ARE ON ONE SIDE OF A BRIDGE AT NIGHT AND WOULD LIKE TO CROSS IT. ONLY TWO CAN CROSS AT A TIME. IN ORDER TO CROSS, A FLASHLIGHT MUST BE USED. THERE IS ONLY ONE FLASHLIGHT. THE FOUR PEOPLE EACH TAKE DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF TIME TO CROSS THE BRIDGE, SO IF TWO PEOPLE CROSS TOGETHER, THEY WILL CROSS AT THE SPEED OF THE SLOWER PERSON (SINCE THEY NEED TO BE TOGETHER AND USE THE FLASHLIGHT). DESCRIBE HOW ALL FOUR PEOPLE CAN REACH THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE IN 17 MINUTES, WITH THE FOLLOWING TIMES FOR EACH PERSON TO CROSS AS FOLLOWS:  PERSON A: 1 MINUTE; PERSON B: 2 MINUTES; PERSON C: 5 MINUTES; PERSON D: 10 MINUTES.\nA & B across (2 minutes), A comes back (1 minute), C & D across (10 minutes), B comes back (B was left there from the first move) (2 minutes), A & B across (2 minutes).\n\nWHAT IS THE SUM OF THE NUMBERS FROM 1 TO 50?\nPair up the numbers into groups of 51 (1 + 50 = 51; 2 + 49 = 51; etc). Twenty-five pairs of 51 = 1,275.\n\nA COMPANY HAS TEN MACHINES THAT PRODUCE GOLD COINS. ONE OF THE MACHINES IS PRODUCING COINS THAT ARE A GRAM LIGHT EACH. HOW DO YOU TELL WHICH MACHINE IS MAKING THE DEFECTIVE COINS WITH ONLY ONE WEIGHING?\nEvery machine will have to produce a sample coin or coins, and you must weigh all these coins together.  How can you indicate which coins came from which machine? If every machine cranks out a different number of coins (machine 1 makes one coin, machine 2 makes two coins, and so on, then taking all the coins and weighing them together against their theoretical weight will give you the answer.  If you\u2019re four grams short, for example, you\u2019ll know that machine 4 is defective.\n\nYOU HAVE 18 BLUE SOCKS AND 14 BLACK ONES IN A DRAWER. IT IS VERY DARK. HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE TO PULL OUT BEFORE YOU HAVE MATCHING PAIR?\nYou need to pick three socks. No color was specified so after choosing three socks, two should be same color.\n\nSAY YOU ARE DRIVING ON A ONE-MILE TRACK. YOU DO ONE LAP AT 30 MILES AN HOUR. HOW FAST DO YOU HAVE TO GO ON THE SECOND LAP TO AVERAGE 60 MILES AN HOUR?\nThe first thought of many people is to say 90 miles an hour, since the average of 30 and 90 is 60, but remember your junior high math: Rate \u00d7 Time = Distance.  If you\u2019ve completed a lap at 30 miles an hour, then to have driven a mile on the mile-long track, you\u2019ve already taken two minutes. Two minutes is the total amount of time you would have to take in order to average 60 miles an hour. Therefore, you cannot average 60 miles an hour over the two laps.\n\nYOU AND YOUR FRIEND GO OUT TO DINNER TOGETHER, AND THE BILL IS $25. YOU AND YOUR FRIEND EACH PAY $15 IN CASH WHICH YOUR WAITER GIVES TO THE CASHIER. THE CASHIER HANDS BACK $5 TO THE WAITER. THE WAITER KEEPS $3 AS A TIP AND HANDS BACK $1 TO EACH OF YOU. SO, YOU AND YOUR FRIEND PAID $14 EACH FOR THE MEAL, FOR A TOTAL OF $28. THE WAITER HAS $3, AND THAT MAKES $31. WHERE DID THE EXTRA DOLLAR COME FROM?\nThis is one of those brainteasers where if you remember the basics (bill + tip = total meal cost) you\u2019ll be fine.  The bill was $25; you and your friend collectively leave a $3 tip.  The total meal cost is $28.  If you each pay $14, you\u2019re paying $14 for the meal AND the tip. You each paid $12.50 for the meal (half of $25), $1.50 for a tip (half of $3) and each got back $1 in change.  Add it all up and it comes to $15 each, for a total of $30.\n\nYOU\u2019RE STANDING AT THREE LIGHT SWITCHES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS TO THE ATTIC. EACH ONE CORRESPONDS TO ONE OF THREE LIGHTS IN THE ATTIC, BUT YOU CANNOT SEE THE LIGHTS FROM WHERE YOU STAND. YOU CAN TURN THE SWITCHES ON AND OFF AND LEAVE THEM IN ANY POSITION. HOW CAN YOU IDENTIFY WHICH SWITCH CORRESPONDS TO WHICH LIGHT BULB IF YOU ARE ONLY ALLOWED ONE TRIP UPSTAIRS?\nTurn on the first two switches and leave them on for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, turn off the second switch, leaving the first switch on. Now go upstairs to the attic. The light that is on is connected to the first switch. A light that is off but has a bulb that is still warm to the touch is connected to the second switch. The light that is both off and cold to the touch is connected to the third switch, which was never turned on.\n\n\u2190Quantitative RecruitingImportant Mathematical Topics for Quants\u2192\nHome News & Insights About Terms Privacy Contact\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Street of Walls.

To continue to monitor the market on whether momentum can sustain. Currently expecting a L-shaped recovery in the coming 6-12 months.\nPerformance is relatively stable, most contributed from carry.\nYTD down 1%, slightly recovered some loss from August (YTD -3% as of end-Aug). Positioning-wise, have sold some positions in India and Middle-East, but the overall risk nature has not changed and is comfortable with the current holdings.\nREI\nOverall market declined in Aug due to concerns over interest rate and HK-China issues\nREI was down in August but has outperformed the benchmark by nearly 2%.\nAustralia contributed most positively. The Australian market was weak in view of renewed concerns of a \u201chigher-for-longer\u201d rate environment. From asset allocation perspective, our Underweight in Australia has thus contributed positively to our performance. On the stock selection front, our off-benchmark holding of an Australian logistic name, Goodman Group, has delivered a very strong performance which has also helped with its outperformance.\nOur stock selection in Philippines contributed positively as well.\nHong Kong is the biggest detractor, mainly due to our holdings of retail landlords and Chinese tourists not spending as much as they did pre-Covid.\nWe took partial profit from our Philippines holding (Ayala Land) and rotated to Thailand (Central Pattana) due to its much stabler political landscape after the election. We also took profit in the market rally in August and reduced China exposure (Longfor Group), rotating into Singapore names such as Keppel DC REIT which are key beneficiaries as rates peak.\nCK Asset remain as our top holding due to its strong balance sheet and defensiveness, followed by Goodman Group.\nIn terms of positioning, Singapore has the biggest absolute and relative weight in our portfolio. We are underweighting Hong Kong, China and Australia. We like Emerging Markets and are Overweight on Thailand and Indonesia.\nSubsector-wise, we continue to be cautious on office while maintaining slight exposure in India due to its slightly better situation. We continue to like logistics, data centers as well as hotel resorts.\nHD\nIn August, the strategy was down and underperformed the benchmark by\nTaiwan was the better performing market in August whilst South Korea and Hong Kong underperformed, with Hong Kong having experienced one of the worst performances since February.\nSector-wise, real estate was the worst performing sector, with the drag mainly attributed by the retail landlords in Hong Kong. We do not hold any stocks of China property developers in this strategy. Financials is one of the key contributing sector due to our Underweight in Chinese banks. Energy have also contributed positively due to the strong oil prices.\nCountry-wise, Thailand was one of the best-performing markets due to the improved sentiment.\nWe reduced China exposure in property-related names, added to Taiwanese AI-related names, as well as rotated into Thailand due to the improved sentiment post-election.\nIn terms of positioning, we continue to Overweight Hong Kong and Singapore. In terms of relative sector weight, we have the biggest Overweight in IT and we continue to be Underweight in financials and materials.\nAES\nIn August, the strategy was down 6.7%, outperforming the BM by around 60bps.\nIn general, our outperformance in August is mostly contributed by our Underweight in China and our focus on bottom-up stock picking. Although some of our China holdings such as Ping An and BYD have dragged the performance, PDD has contributed positively with its earnings beating market estimates. We continue to focus on companies in China with stable earnings and less pressure on cut in sales guidance, such as Wuxi AppTec, Baidu and Meituan which have reported strong results and shown resilient earnings recently.\nTaiwan e-paper technology leader, E-Ink, has recently cut their 2023 sales guidance, hence the stock has underperformed this month within our Taiwan picks. We have added positions in other technology names such as Wiwynn and Unimicron due to the industry\u2019s positive outlook.\nOur Overweight in Indonesia with positive stock selection (banking sector in particular) has also contributed to the outperformance.\nWithin ASEAN and India, we continue to be positive but have finetuned our holdings, by taking profit on Bank Mandiri and adding exposure to Bank Rakyat Indonesia.\nWithin Hong Kong, we have exited HKEX due to weak trading volume and lack of catalysts.\nANGL\nIn August, the strategy was down -6.7% but has outperformed the benchmark by around 60bp. The strategy\u2019s past months of outperformance has narrowed down the YTD relative underperformance compared with the benchmark.\nBoth PDD and Miniso have significantly beaten earnings expectations, due to the robust business growth in their sector targeting the mass market with its products at lower price points, as well as their expanding market share in their merchandise category.\nIn Taiwan, technology continue to hold up its performance in August. Our Taiwan technology holding (E-ink) was a detractor upon cutting its 2023 sales guidance. Some of our Chinese holdings such as BYD has also dragged our performance.\nIn terms of thematic exposure, we continue to maintain exposure to technology and are positive on major trends such as AI, with a focus on high-end ABF and semi-equipment names.\nIn terms of country exposure, we are Underweight in Hong Kong and China, and positive on Taiwan although we have done some rotation taking profits on certain names which have outperformed a lot, such as AICHIP. We also continue to build exposure in Japan in the semi-equipment segment.\nCES\nIn August, the strategy has strongly outperformed the benchmark by 2.4%, mainly contributed by our stock selections in energy and consumer discretionary segments.\nOur Overweight in internet names and communication services have contributed positively, while our position in more defensive SOE names in telecommunications have also outperformed the broader market. On the other hand, our Overweight in banks and financials have detracted.\nWe have sold positions in value holdings such as construction and railway companies as we are positioning to rotate to growth. We have also trimmed down names with less catalysts for the remaining year and bought internet names like Alibaba.\nCES is the best performing Chinese Equity Fund on HSBC platform.\nSome of the reasons for our outperformance against other Chinese equity funds and the broader market may include:\ni) Compared to CES, the considerably large size of other competitors funds make it more difficult for the asset managers to switch investment styles given the market volatility;\nii) Many other asset managers are not allowed to trade U.S. Executive Order restricted companies, whilst our investment in some of the names under the Order in Telecom, Energy and Construction sectors have generated strong positive returns, thus offering a more flexible approach with better downside protection;\niii) Some managers are too aggressive in their positioning in consumption and healthcare names, which we have been Underweight in, leading to our strong outperformance against peers."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here are the extracted details from the provided texts:\n\nText 1:\n- Time: 19 Sep 2023 03:18 PM\n- Message Title: IWS Insights Lab\n- Hashtags: #equities #internal\n\nText 2:\n- Time: 19 Sep 2023 09:57 AM\n- Message Title: IWS Insights Lab\n- Hashtags: #pbhk #internal #SWAT #discretionary #CMIdeas #InvestmentInsights #MobileActive\n\nText 3:\n- Time: 19 Sep 2023 09:18 AM\n- Message Title: IWS Insights Lab\n- Hashtags: #pulsecheck #internal\n\nText 4:\n- Time: 19 Sep 2023 09:08 AM\n- Message Title: IWS Insights Lab\n- Hashtags: #CMideas #internal\n\nText 5:\n- Time: 18 Sep 2023 09:01 AM\n- Message Title: IWS Insights Lab\n- Hashtags: #pulsecheck #internal\n\nText 6:\n- Time: 15 Sep 2023 06:09 PM\n- Message Title: IWS Insights Lab\n- Hashtags: #pbhk #internal\n\nText 7:\n- Time: 15 Sep 2023 05:09 PM\n- Message Title: IWS Insights Lab\n- Hashtags: #pulsecheck #funds #longonlyfunds #internal\n\nText 8:\n- Time: 15 Sep 2023 09:22 AM\n- Message Title: IWS Insights Lab\n- Hashtags: #pulsecheck #internal\n\nText 9:\n- Time: 14 Sep 2023 12:15 PM\n- Message Title: IWS Insights Lab\n- Hashtags: #Discretionary #DPM #PBHK #internal\n\nPlease note that the message title is identified as the first line after the hashtags, and the hashtags themselves are extracted as requested."}]}, {"facetValue": "extract specific information from provided texts, including time, date, message title, and hashtags.

This could involve finding specific game elements, clues, or hidden objects within the game environment. Such searches often require a keen eye, good problem-solving skills, and a persistent attitude. Searching is an essential skill for players to progress and uncover new aspects of the game.\n\nWhile searching for in-game information is a common practice among gamers, outside of the game world, the practice of searching for information is becoming increasingly important within the game development industry itself. One notable instance of this is the rise of Game Workers Unite (GWU), a union organising project seeking to improve the working conditions of game developers. This article investigates the key debates that have emerged within the GWU, with a specific focus on its UK branch (GWU UK).\n\nThe analysis presented is based on a period of participatory observation and a series of interviews with board members of GWU UK. The article evaluates GWU in relation to other recent attempts at unionising the game industry. It concludes that the strategies adopted to counter the hyper-visibility and individualisation of the game worker are key contributions of GWU in contemporary video game labour. These strategies include emphasising collective bargaining power and promoting worker solidarity, both of which stand in contrast to the more individualistic approaches taken to game development labour by both industry elites and a significant portion of the workforce.\n\nThis article also draws on the work of Dyer-Witheford and de Peuter's (2009) Games of empire: Global capitalism and video games, to evaluate the historical specificity of GWU and the importance of the organisation for the contemporary video game industry. The authors argue that video games have become integral to neoliberal globalisation, and that a critical assessment of the industry is necessary to ensure the fair treatment of workers.\n\nIn conclusion, the practice of searching for information within video games is a key component of player progression and discovery. However, searching for better conditions and fair treatment within the video game industry is just as vital. GWU UK's approach to collective bargaining and worker solidarity offers a promising alternative to the individualistic and hyper-visible models of the game industry.

These trains are powered by electricity and are primarily used for commuter and regional passenger services. EMUs are designed to be self-sufficient, with each carriage having its own traction motors and being capable of independent movement in case of a failure of another carriage in the same unit. This design provides redundancy and increases overall reliability.\n\nEMUs can be classified according to their electrical supply system, including overhead lines, third rail, or both. The operation of EMUs began in the early 20th century, with the introduction of the London Underground's City and South London Railway. The early EMUs were typically restricted to suburban and commuter services due to their limited range but saw significant expansion in the post-World War II period as electrification increased across the UK rail network.\n\nOver the years, EMUs have evolved, both in terms of technological advancements and design. Many different EMU classes have been developed and utilized, some notable ones being the British Rail Class 302, Class 305, Class 313, and Class 315, among many others. Modern EMUs now incorporate advanced features such as regenerative braking and computerized control systems.\n\nIn recent years, due to environmental concerns and the need for more energy-efficient vehicles, the focus has been on further electrification of the rail network in the UK. As a result, the importance of EMUs has increased, and modern EMU designs emphasize energy efficiency, accessibility, and comfort for passengers. Newer EMU fleets taking the spotlight include the Class 700, Class 800, and Class 345, which are now being introduced in various rail operations across the country."}]}, {"facetValue": "count the number of words in a provided article.

From simple machines that performed repetitive and menial tasks, they have become sophisticated and intelligent systems capable of performing complex functions, including decision-making, in various industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, logistics, and even our homes.\n\nRobots have become an integral part of many industries as businesses seek to improve efficiency and reduce costs. They can work around the clock without taking breaks, do not require sleep or rest, and perform tasks with precision and consistency. Furthermore, robots can perform dangerous tasks that would be impossible or too risky for humans, such as working in hazardous environments like deep sea exploration, nuclear facilities, and space exploration.\n\nWith the rapid advancement in technology, many experts predict that robots will eventually replace humans in the workforce. Some even argue that this process has already begun. According to a recent report by the McKinsey Global Institute, up to 800 million workers worldwide\u2014about one-fifth of the global workforce\u2014could be replaced by robots in the next decade.\n\nWhile robots offer significant benefits in terms of cost savings and efficiency, their growing presence in the workforce has raised concerns over the impact on human employment and the economy. The rise of robots could lead to massive job losses, particularly in industries such as manufacturing, where automation is already widespread.\n\nOne of the main criticisms against robots is that they do not provide the same level of quality service that humans do. Despite their growing intelligence and sophisticated capabilities, robots lack the empathy and emotional intelligence that humans possess. They cannot read human emotions or understand the nuances of human behavior, which makes them unsuitable for jobs that require interpersonal skills, such as healthcare and education.\n\nMoreover, robots are not capable of handling unexpected situations that require creative problem solving or critical thinking. These skills are essential in many industries, especially in jobs that require innovation and adaptation, such as marketing, advertising, and design.\n\nAnother concern is the impact of robots on the economy. While robots can significantly reduce costs for businesses, they also eliminate jobs for humans, which could lead to increased inequality and social unrest. The displacement of human workers could also reduce consumer demand and lead to a decline in economic growth.\n\nGovernments and policymakers are faced with a dilemma over how to address these concerns while still fostering innovation and the adoption of advanced technology. Some have proposed imposing taxes on companies that replace human workers with robots, while others have suggested incentives for companies that invest in human capital, such as education and training programs.\n\nOrganizations are also taking steps in addressing these concerns by adopting a more comprehensive approach to integrating robots into their workforce. This includes redefining job roles to incorporate the strengths of robots and humans, investing in education and training to develop the skills needed to work alongside robots effectively, and establishing policies and programs to mitigate the impact on displaced workers.\n\nThe adoption of cobots\u2014collaborative robots that work alongside humans\u2014is a growing trend in many industries. Cobots can assist human workers with tasks that are too dangerous, strenuous, or monotonous, such as lifting heavy objects or assembling parts, while also providing greater precision and efficiency. Other potential applications of cobots include providing customized services for users, such as personalized nutrition or exercise plans, or assisting people with disabilities.\n\nHowever, the adoption of cobots is not without challenges. Cobots require a different approach to work, and workers must be trained to work closely with them effectively. There are also concerns over cobots replacing human workers completely, particularly in low-skill jobs, and the potential impact on the economy.\n\nIn conclusion, the rise of robots poses both opportunities and challenges for human workers, the economy, and society as a whole. While robots offer significant benefits in terms of efficiency and cost savings, the displacement of human workers and potential impact on the economy raise concerns that must be addressed. A comprehensive and inclusive approach that incorporates the strengths of both robots and humans and supports the development of workers\u2019 skills is needed to realize the full potential of robots and mitigate their impact on human employment and the economy"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are 536 words in this article."}]}]}, {"summary": "The user requested assistance with obtaining quotations for dental products and services, locating nearby shops, and creating a PowerPoint presentation on tele-dentistry's impact in Texas.

By reducing barriers and ensuring adequate access to oral healthcare, we improve the overall health outcomes and enhance the overall health equity for diverse populations across Texas.\n\nSlide 4: Tele-dentistry: The Solution\n\nTitle: Tele-dentistry: The Solution\n\nTele-dentistry, the delivery of dental services using telecommunications technology, offers a promising solution to bridge the oral health gap by increasing access to quality dental care. Through the use of digital communication tools, tele-dentistry allows patients to receive consultation, diagnosis, and treatment recommendations from dental professionals remotely. This approach encompasses virtual appointments, remote monitoring, and telediagnosis, enabling access to dental care that overcomes geographical and socioeconomic limitations.\n\nSlide 5: Potential Benefits of Tele-dentistry\n\nTitle: Potential Benefits of Tele-dentistry\n\nAdopting tele-dentistry in Texas brings several advantages that have the potential to transform oral healthcare access and outcomes:\n\n1. Increased Access: Tele-dentistry eliminates geographic barriers, making oral healthcare available to individuals living in remote or underserved areas where dental services may be scarce.\n  \n2. Convenience: Patients can receive dental consultations from the comfort of their homes, reducing the need for extensive travel or time away from work or school.\n\n3. Cost-Effectiveness: Tele-dentistry has the potential to lower overall oral healthcare costs by reducing travel expenses and unnecessary emergency visits.\n\n4. Improved Oral Health Education: Tele-dentistry platforms can educate patients about preventive care, proper oral hygiene practices, and early intervention techniques, empowering individuals to take control of their oral health.\n\nSlide 6: Conclusion\n\nTitle: Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the implementation of tele-dentistry holds great promise in reducing oral health barriers and improving access to dental care for diverse populations in Texas. By harnessing the power of digital communication, tele-dentistry addresses the challenges of geography, transportation, and limited resources, ensuring that everyone, regardless of their location or socioeconomic status, receives timely and quality oral healthcare.\n\nThrough this presentation, we will explore the various impacts of tele-dentistry in reducing oral health barriers, improving oral health outcomes, and promoting health equity in Texas. Together, we can work towards a future where oral healthcare is accessible and equitable for all residents of the Lone Star State.\n\nThank you.\n\nFeel free to modify or personalize the content to better align with your specific objectives and preferred writing style."}, {"role": "user", "content": "write one slide for  background of issue"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly!

Most psychologists who study \nreading believe that lexical access is an interactive process. It combines information of \ndifferent kinds, such as the features of letters, the letters themselves, and the words com\u0002prising the letters (Morton, 1969).\nInvestigators (McClelland, Mirman, & Holt, 2009; Rumelhart & McClelland 1981, \n1982) developed an interactive-activation model suggesting that activation of particular \nlexical elements occurs at multiple levels. Moreover, activity at each of the levels is inter\u0002active (Figure 9.5 ). The interactive-activation model distinguishes among three levels of processing \nfollowing visual input\u2014the feature level, the letter level, and the word level. The model \nassumes that information at each level is represented separately in memory. Information \npasses from one level to another bidirectionally. In other words, processing occurs in each \nof two directions. First, it is bottom-up, starting with sensory data and working up to \nhigher levels of cognitive processing. Second, it is top-down, starting with high-level cog\u0002nition operating on prior knowledge and experiences related to a given context. The inter\u0002active view implies that we not only use the visually or orally perceptible features of letters \nto help us identify words but also the features we already know about words to help us \nidentify letters. For this reason, the model is referred to as \u201cinteractive\u201d (Plaut et al., 1996).\nOther theorists have suggested alternatives to Rumelhart and McClelland\u2019s model \n(e.g., Meyer & Schvaneveldt, 1976; Paap et al., 1982), but the distinctions among interac\u0002tive models go beyond the scope of this introductory text. Support for word-recognition \nmodels involving discrete levels of processing comes from studies of cerebral processing \n(Harley, 2008; Petersen et al., 1988; Posner et al., 1988, 1989). Studies that map brain \nmetabolism via PET and fMRI (see Chapter 2) indicate that different regions of the brain \nbecome activated during passive visual processing of word forms, as opposed to seman\u0002tic analysis of words or even spoken pronunciation of the words. \nIn addition to neuropsychological support, a number of word-recognition mod\u0002els have been simulated on computers (e.g., Harm & Seidenberg, 2004). Both models \naptly predicted a word-superiority effect as well as a pseudo word-superiority effect. The \nword-superiority effect is similar to the configural-superiority effect and the object-supe\u0002riority effect (mentioned in regard to top-down influences on perception). In the word\u0002superiority effect, letters are read more easily when they are embedded in words than \nwhen they are presented either in isolation or with letters that do not form words. People \ntake substantially longer to read unrelated letters than to read letters that form a word \n(Cattell, 1886). This effect is sometimes called the Reicher-Wheeler effect, named for two \nresearchers who did early investigations of this effect (Reicher, 1969; Wheeler, 1970).\nTo observe the word-superiority effect, researchers use an experimental paradigm \ncalled the lexical-decision task. In this paradigm, a string of letters is presented briefly. \nIt then is either removed or covered by a visual mask, a pattern that wipes out the pre\u0002viously presented stimulus from iconic memory (see Chapter 5 for more information \nabout the iconic memory store). The participant then is asked to make a decision about \nwhether the string of letters is a word.\nTo observe the word-superiority effect, the standard lexical-decision task is modified \nto examine the processing of letters (see Figure 9.6 ). Participants are more accurate in choosing the correct letter when it is presented in the context of a word than they are in \nchoosing the correct letter when it is presented in isolation (Johnston & McClelland, 1973). \nEven letters in pronounceable pseudo words (e.g., \u201cMARD\u201d) are identified more accurately \nthan letters in isolation. However, strings of letters that cannot be pronounced as words \n(e.g., \u201cORWK\u201d) do not aid in identification (Grainger et al., 2003; Pollatsek & Rayner, 1989). \n Explore Lab 44, Word Superiority, in CogLab.\nThere is also a sentence-superiority effect (Cattell, 1886; Perfetti, 1985): People take \nabout twice as long to read unrelated words as to read words in a sentence (Cattell, 1886). \nThe sentence-superiority effect can be seen in other paradigms as well. For example, \nsuppose that a reader briefly sees a degraded stimulus. The word window, for example, \nmight be shown but in degraded form (Figure 9.7 ). When the word is standing by \nitself in this form, it is more difficult to recognize than when it is preceded by a sentence \ncontext. An example of such a context would be, \u201cThere were several repair jobs to be \ndone. The first was to fix the _____.\u201d (Perfetti, 1985). Having a meaningful context for a \nstimulus helps the reader to perceive it.\nContext effects work at both conscious and preconscious levels. At the conscious level, \nwe have active control over the use of context to determine word meanings. At the pre\u0002conscious level, the use of context is probably automatic and outside our active control. \nParticipants seem to make lexical decisions more quickly when presented with strings of \nletters that commonly are associated pairs of words (e.g., \u201cdoctor\u201d and \u201cnurse\u201d or \u201cbread\u201d \nand \u201cbutter\u201d). They respond more slowly when presented with unassociated pairs of \nwords, with pairs of nonwords, or with pairs involving a word and a nonword (Hyoenae, J., \n& Lindeman, 2008; Meyer & Schvaneveldt, 1971; Schvaneveldt, Meyer, & Becker, 1976)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "- Lexical access is important for reading, allowing the retrieval of a word's meaning from memory.\n- Interactive process: combines information from letter features, letters, and words (Morton, 1969).\n- Interactive-activation model: suggests multiple levels of lexical activation \u2013 feature, letter, and word levels.

The ultimate reason for this is Moore's law, or rather its generalization of continued exponentially falling cost per unit of computation. Most AI research has been conducted as if the computation available to the agent were constant (in which case leveraging human knowledge would be one of the only ways to improve performance) but, over a slightly longer time than a typical research project, massively more computation inevitably becomes available. Seeking an improvement that makes a difference in the shorter term, researchers seek to leverage their human knowledge of the domain, but the only thing that matters in the long run is the leveraging of computation. These two need not run counter to each other, but in practice they tend to. Time spent on one is time not spent on the other. There are psychological commitments to investment in one approach or the other. And the human-knowledge approach tends to complicate methods in ways that make them less suited to taking advantage of general methods leveraging computation.  There were many examples of AI researchers' belated learning of this bitter lesson, and it is instructive to review some of the most prominent.\n\n In computer chess, the methods that defeated the world champion, Kasparov, in 1997, were based on massive, deep search. At the time, this was looked upon with dismay by the majority of computer-chess researchers who had pursued methods that leveraged human understanding of the special structure of chess. When a simpler, search-based approach with special hardware and software proved vastly more effective, these human-knowledge-based chess researchers were not good losers. They said that ``brute force\" search may have won this time, but it was not a general strategy, and anyway it was not how people played chess. These researchers wanted methods based on human input to win and were disappointed when they did not.\n\n A similar pattern of research progress was seen in computer Go, only delayed by a further 20 years. Enormous initial efforts went into avoiding search by taking advantage of human knowledge, or of the special features of the game, but all those efforts proved irrelevant, or worse, once search was applied effectively at scale. Also important was the use of learning by self play to learn a value function (as it was in many other games and even in chess, although learning did not play a big role in the 1997 program that first beat a world champion). Learning by self play, and learning in general, is like search in that it enables massive computation to be brought to bear. Search and learning are the two most important classes of techniques for utilizing massive amounts of computation in AI research. In computer Go, as in computer chess, researchers' initial effort was directed towards utilizing human understanding (so that less search was needed) and only much later was much greater success had by embracing search and learning.\n\n In speech recognition, there was an early competition, sponsored by DARPA, in the 1970s. Entrants included a host of special methods that took advantage of human knowledge---knowledge of words, of phonemes, of the human vocal tract, etc. On the other side were newer methods that were more statistical in nature and did much more computation, based on hidden Markov models (HMMs). Again, the statistical methods won out over the human-knowledge-based methods. This led to a major change in all of natural language processing, gradually over decades, where statistics and computation came to dominate the field. The recent rise of deep learning in speech recognition is the most recent step in this consistent direction. Deep learning methods rely even less on human knowledge, and use even more computation, together with learning on huge training sets, to produce dramatically better speech recognition systems. As in the games, researchers always tried to make systems that worked the way the researchers thought their own minds worked---they tried to put that knowledge in their systems---but it proved ultimately counterproductive, and a colossal waste of researcher's time, when, through Moore's law, massive computation became available and a means was found to put it to good use.\n\n In computer vision, there has been a similar pattern. Early methods conceived of vision as searching for edges, or generalized cylinders, or in terms of SIFT features. But today all this is discarded. Modern deep-learning neural networks use only the notions of convolution and certain kinds of invariances, and perform much better.\n\n This is a big lesson. As a field, we still have not thoroughly learned it, as we are continuing to make the same kind of mistakes. To see this, and to effectively resist it, we have to understand the appeal of these mistakes. We have to learn the bitter lesson that building in how we think we think does not work in the long run. The bitter lesson is based on the historical observations that 1) AI researchers have often tried to build knowledge into their agents, 2) this always helps in the short term, and is personally satisfying to the researcher, but 3) in the long run it plateaus and even inhibits further progress, and 4) breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation by search and learning. The eventual success is tinged with bitterness, and often incompletely digested, because it is success over a favored, human-centric approach. \n\n One thing that should be learned from the bitter lesson is the great power of general purpose methods, of methods that continue to scale with increased computation even as the available computation becomes very great. The two methods that seem to scale arbitrarily in this way are search and learning. \n\n The second general point to be learned from the bitter lesson is that the actual contents of minds are tremendously, irredeemably complex; we should stop trying to find simple ways to think about the contents of minds, such as simple ways to think about space, objects, multiple agents, or symmetries. All these are part of the arbitrary, intrinsically-complex, outside world. They are not what should be built in, as their complexity is endless; instead we should build in only the meta-methods that can find and capture this arbitrary complexity. Essential to these methods is that they can find good approximations, but the search for them should be by our methods, not by us.

Modern deep-learning neural networks use only the notions of convolution and certain kinds of invariances, and perform much better.\n\nThis is a big lesson. As a field, we still have not thoroughly learned it, as we are continuing to make the same kind of mistakes. To see this, and to effectively resist it, we have to understand the appeal of these mistakes. We have to learn the bitter lesson that building in how we think we think does not work in the long run. The bitter lesson is based on the historical observations that 1) AI researchers have often tried to build knowledge into their agents, 2) this always helps in the short term, and is personally satisfying to the researcher, but 3) in the long run it plateaus and even inhibits further progress, and 4) breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation by search and learning. The eventual success is tinged with bitterness, and often incompletely digested, because it is success over a favored, human-centric approach. \n\nOne thing that should be learned from the bitter lesson is the great power of general purpose methods, of methods that continue to scale with increased computation even as the available computation becomes very great. The two methods that seem to scale arbitrarily in this way are search and learning. \n\nThe second general point to be learned from the bitter lesson is that the actual contents of minds are tremendously, irredeemably complex; we should stop trying to find simple ways to think about the contents of minds, such as simple ways to think about space, objects, multiple agents, or symmetries. All these are part of the arbitrary, intrinsically-complex, outside world. They are not what should be built in, as their complexity is endless; instead we should build in only the meta-methods that can find and capture this arbitrary complexity. Essential to these methods is that they can find good approximations, but the search for them should be by our methods, not by us. We want AI agents that can discover like we can, not which contain what we have discovered. Building in our discoveries only makes it harder to see how the discovering process can be done.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "- Seventy years of AI research converge on a \"bitter lesson\": scalable computational methods outpace those embedded with human knowledge, suggesting that future AI should harness search and learning for tackling complex tasks rather than relying on human-like reasoning."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What has J\u00fcrgen Schmidthuber to say on this subject?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber, a prominent figure in the field of artificial intelligence and deep learning, has contributed to the discussion on the efficacy of leveraging computation over infusing human knowledge into AI systems.

He has heavily contributed to the development of methods in neural networks and deep learning, including the foundational work on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are a type of recurrent neural network capable of learning long-term dependencies.\n\nSchmidhuber's work supports the idea that machine learning models, which can improve and adapt through experience (data), are critical to achieving general AI. By extension, this lines up with the sentiment that general methods leveraging computation are ultimately more effective in the long run, a key point in Sutton's \"The Bitter Lesson.\"\n\nFor Schmidhuber's specific thoughts on this matter, one would need to look at his latest papers, talks, and interviews for direct commentary."}]}, {"facetValue": "convert their bullet points into an essay.

The temple and its grounds hold countless memories of friendships, learning, and spiritual growth. It is a place where I feel a strong sense of belonging and connection to my Jewish community.\n\nIn conclusion, the concept of memorials extends beyond physical structures. Memorials are personal to each individual, representing places or moments that hold special meaning and memories.

Our meta-analysis revealed that patients with penile prosthesis infection had a significantly higher mean NLR than those without infection (mean difference 1.25, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 1.86). Moreover, NLR was found to be a significant predictor of infection risk on multivariate analysis in three of the included studies. Our findings suggest that NLR may be a useful biomarker for identifying patients at higher risk of developing penile prosthesis infection. Further prospective studies are required to validate these findings and determine the optimal threshold for NLR in predicting infection risk. \n\nKeywords: neutrophil lymphocyte ratio, penile prosthesis infection, risk factors, biomarkers, meta-analysis"}]}, {"facetValue": "generate an abstract based on the input article, with the ability to input the article in parts.", "allFacetValues": [{"facet": "Request", "value": "generate an abstract based on the input article, with the ability to input the article in parts."}, {"facet": "Language", "value": "English"}, {"facet": "Task", "value": "generate an abstract based on the input article provided by the user.

Next we state our research motivation (section 1.2), and we present overall contribution and innovations of the research (section 1.3). We finish up with the basic organization of the following of the thesis (section 1.4).\n1.1 Research Background and Significance\nRecent researches have focused on developing hand and high-precision finger motion detection systems for a variety of applications based on tracking methods, such as robotics, virtual reality, and medicine Rehabilitation. Some of those applications are as follow:\n-Robotics:  The most popular study field in robotics is the manufacture of prostherix hands. Researchers design prototype of an underactuated prosthetic hand, which improve the range of motion and dexterity of thumb and pinch and innovatively restore the capability of the thumb-index pinch [1].\n-Virtual reality:  Hand movement is the main means of interacting with the environment, so it is crucial in virtual reality (VR) applications. Although the existing inverse kinematics motion detection is sufficient for full body tracking (Fig.1.1) [2], it is difficult to locate small body parts such as fingers, and these parts are often blocked in the optical detection process. VR professionals need additional systems (such as inertial trackers) with low reliability [3].\n-Medicine Rehabilitation:  A 5-DOF hand rehabilitation robot is designed and developed using a synthetic method for generating natural curved finger tip motion using a 1-DOF mechanism (Fig.1.2). It\u2019s practical in the diagnosis and treatment of hand injuries and diseases [4].\nWith the help of advanced sensors and computer vision methods, those system is able to capture and analyze finger movements. Machine learning algorithms are often used to interpret the data and provide real-time feedback to users [5,6] .\nThese studies give us examples and inspires of the importance of hand-finger motion detection in different industries, and also show promise in improving the accuracy of the finger motion detection and tracking system. However, there are still challenges in developing a compact and comfortable system for users to wear and use for a long time, as well as its applicability in more application scenarios.\n1.2 Motivation\nThe existing research has done enough detail in measuring and tracking hand movements, and has derived many extensions and applications in various fields. However, the bending and extension of a single finger is different from the movement of the entire hand, and the detection of finger movement becomes very difficult when moving or rotating.\nIn current finger motion detection technology, there are two distinct categories can be distinguished depending on the use of cameras or individual sensors. \n-Vision based: Use passive optical motion capture technology by setting cameras to capture the dynamic image of a specially designed glove with markers, then use the machine vision technique to process the images and correlate the local variation of image to the motion of fingers or change in the hand gesture [7,8]. The vision based hand tracking system has non-contact perception function, making hand motion detection convenient and efficient. Besides, machine vision and imaging analysis based on camara involve expensive components and complex algorithms [9], which are very expensive for ordinary users.\nThe main advantage of a vision based system is its high tracking accuracy, but it has drawbacks such as sensitivity to light intensity fluctuations and occlusion issues, which may lead to tracking errors [10].\n-Sensors based: The sensor-based systems directly detect the motion and bending of the fingers using various types of sensors such as accelerometers [4], gyroscopes, magnetic sensors, resistive sensors, and ElectroMyoGraphy (EMG) sensors [11] etc. To a certain it can help to mitigate the problem of vision-based system. Besides, the sensor-based systems are also in general more compact and inexpensive. However, acceleration or inertial sensors are generally susceptible to gravitational artifacts due to the rotation and vibration of arms or bodies.\nIn our research, we intend to design and develop a magnetic sensors based device which is hihgly compact and have ability to detect finger motions real-time accurately. Because magnetic sensors have advantages over limitations of vision based systems which severely restricted the adoption of hand tracking in real-world applications (bulky tethered systems is impractical and line of sight or privacy concerns) [12].\nFinger tips are significant marks of hand kinematics analysis, which have fewer amounts than joint angles of fingers and simpler structure. We intend to fix a magnetic sensor on each fingertips and a permanent magnet on the dorsal side of the hand to detect finger motions. Since the magnetic permeability of the human body is very similar to air, water and other non-ferromagnetic materials, it does not affect the static magnetic field [13]. The low-cost, compact, and accessible hand-finger motion tracking system is possible.\n1.3 Contributions \nWe propose a magnetic hand-finger motion tracking system which is simple, compact, low-cost, accurate and unobstructive for intelligent human-computer interface and various other applications involving hand gestures recognization. The core principle is relative fingertips position estimating with the use of magnetic sensors, then detect the hand gestures from the orientation and locations of the fingertips. The main contributions of our research are:\n1.\tA intelligent finger motion tracking system using magnetic sensors is porposed. For sensors detecting part of the system, we choose the scheme that measure the orientations and locations of sensors in motion in a stationary magnetic field created by one permanent magnet. A permanent magnet is fixed on the dorsal side of the hand. Five 9-axis IMUs is settled on each of the fingertips, and one 6-axis IMU is fixed with the permanent magnet in order to achieve the attitude calibration and distance measurement between IMUs. After we get the result of finger motion by combining each 9-axis sensors\u2019 orientations and locations (angular velocity on 3-axis, acceleration rate on 3-axis, and magnetic flux density on 3-axis), the next step is to adopt deep learning approaches to realize the real-time gesture recognization function. Various common gestures can be displayed as corresponding patterns when we make actual movements.\n2.\tA set of algorithms for computing orientations and locations of sensors on the fingertips are proposed. First, we use EKF method for estimating the orientations of the 9-axis sensors on the fingertips to the 6-axis sensors on the dorsal side of the hand. After orthogonalization the coordinate system of two sensors through matrix operation, we apply L-M algorithm to calculate the linear distance between those two sensors to get the locations of 9-axis sensors. The L-M algorithm is based on a dipole model which approximate the magnet as a dipole under the research condition. Our experiments show the dipole model satisfied high approximation and accuracy within a certain range which is sufficient for finger motion tracking and gesture recognization. \n3.\tA DNN method is adopted to achieve the real-time gesture recognization function. DNN map the features of existing spatial samples to another feature space through layer by layer feature mapping, in order to learn better feature representation for existing inputs. Firstly we maintain the posture of a specified gesture on the device and create positional data of the gesture in three-dimensional space through the movements and rotations of the hand and wrist. Then we cyclically group and train all data to obtain high accuracy in both training and testing sets. Finally, we use the wearable device to continuously make any gesture in the gesture library, the terminal can accurately display the corresponding gesture pattern.\nWe develop our device prototype on a SBC: Raspberry pi 4b. It is also fixed on the dorsal side of hand aiming to read data and computing the orientations and locations of sensors. The data from 9-axis sensors are transmitted by I2C bus real-timely to the SBC for the next step of attitude calibration and distance calculation. Besides, we use our originally designed PCB to achieve improvements on stability and integration. Finally we fabricate prototype device on a left-hand glove, improve the compactness and comfort additionally.\nCHAPTER 2\nTHEORETICAL BASICS\nIn this chapter, the working principle of the accelerometer and gyroscope in the IMU used in this paper is introduced, then the measuring principle of the Hall effect magnetic sensor is described, the physical meaning of the basic data we obtained through the nine axis sensor is analyzed.,then the use of quaternion in helping to improve the efficiency of the rotation algorithm is introduced. Finally the communication flow of I2C protocol is introduced and the calculation of Jacobian matrix.\n2.1 IMU Measurement Principle\nThe IMUs used in this research are MEMS 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer with digital outputs. \n- Gyroscopes:  or gyros, are devices that measure or maintain rotational motion. MEMS gyros are small, inexpensive sensors that measure angular velocity. The units of angular velocity are measured in degrees per second (\u00b0/s) or revolutions per second (rps). Angular velocity is simply a measurement of speed of rotation.\nThe gyro within MEMS is tiny in scale (tipically under 100 micrometers), When the gyro is rotated, a small resonating mass is shifted as the angular velocity changes (Fig. 2.1). This movement is converted into very low-current electrical signals that can be amplified and converted into digital signals by amplifiers and ADC modules.\n- Accelerometer:  or accels, are devices that measure acceleration, which is the rate of change of the velocity of an object. They measure in meters per second squared (m/s2) or in G-forces (g). A single G-force for us here on planet Earth is equivalent to 9.8 m/s2, but this does vary slightly with elevation (and will be a different value on different planets due to variations in gravitational pull). Accelerometers are useful for sensing vibrations in systems or for orientation applications.\n\t\tGenerally, accelerometers contain capacitive plates internally. Some of these are fixed, while others are attached to minuscule springs that move internally as acceleration forces act upon the sensor. As these plates move in relation to each other, the capacitance between them changes. From these changes in capacitance, the acceleration can be determined. Other accelerometers can be centered around piezoelectric materials (Fig. 2.2). These tiny crystal structures output electrical charge when placed under mechanical stress.

The existing mag technology is usually based on two principles: magnetoresistance effect and Hall-effect. The mag used in this study is composed and integrated of a Hall element compass, which is the most extensively used sensors for sensing magnetic fields. \n\tThe Lorentz force produces a voltage perpendicular to the direction of the current and magnetic field which is the hall voltage (Fig. 2.3). According to the left hand rule, the direction of the voltage varies with the direction of the magnetic flux. The magnitude and direction of the magnetic field is subsequently possible to be detected by read the magnitude and direction of the voltage .\n2.3 Quaternion\nEuler rotation, quaternion, and matrix rotation are all mathematical methods for representing the orientation of objects. Compared to the other two methods, the quaternion has smaller storage space, higher computational efficiency, and no deadlock issues. However, it can not represent the orientations intuitively. \nThe mathematical expression for quaternion is:\nQ \u20d7=q_0+q \u20d7=q_0+q_1 i \u20d7+q_2 j \u20d7+q_3 k \u20d7\nWhere q_0 is the is the scalar part, and q \u20d7 is the vector part. And i \u20d7, j \u20d7, and k \u20d7 are the unit vectors of the x, y, and z axis respectively.\nThis is the trigonometric expression for quaternion. \u03b8 is the rotation angle around the reference axis ranges in (\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0).\nSince both of Euler rotation, quaternion, and matrix rotation can represent the orientation of a point in specific coordinate system, the mutual transformation of the same rotational motion expressed in different ways will make our calculation of the final position of the object more flexible and convenient. Starting from the three-axis rotational motions in the matrix rotation coordinate system (Fig. 2.4), After derivation and verification, we obtained the transforming expressions between quaternion and Euler rotation written as follow. The rest of transforming expressions for the other two methods can be found in Appendix 2A [14]:\n2.4 I2C Communications Protocol\nI2C is a two-wire interface comprised of the signals serial data (SDA) and serial clock (SCL). In general, the lines are open-drain and bi-directional. In a generalized I2C interface implementation, attached devices can be a master or a slave. The master device puts the slave address on the bus, and the slave device with the matching address acknowledges the master. \nI2C data bytes are defined to be 8-bits long. Each byte transferred must be followed by an acknowledge (ACK) signal. The clock for the acknowledge signal is generated by the master, while the receiver generates the actual acknowledge signal by pulling down SDA and holding it low during the HIGH portion of the acknowledge clock pulse \n2.5 Jacobian Matrix\n\tJacobian matrix is the basis of robotics, aircraft attitude, navigation and other research fields, which is going to be used for linearization in section 4.2. It essentially is a matrix formed by the first order partial derivative in a certain way, and its determinant is called Jacobian determinant. The importance of the Jacobian matrix lies in reflecting the optimal linear approximation of a differentiable equation to a given point, which can linearize a nonlinear equation system at a reference point, such as linear objects required for linear model predictive control in autonomous driving control. \n\tFor example, Suppose there is a function that maps from an n-dimensional Euclidean space to an m-dimensional Euclidean space, consisting of m real functions:\nThe partial derivative of these functions (if any) can form a matrix with m rows and n columns (m \u00d7 n), which is called Jacobian matrix:\nCHAPTER 3\nDESIGN OF ARCHITECTURE AND HARDWARE STRUCTURE\n3.1 Introduction\nIn this chapter, the design and development of architecture and hardware structure of the intelligent finger motion tracking system is discussed. \nWe chose an IMMU-based hand-finger pose estimation device implemented in  \u2018Hand-finger pose trackingusing inertial and nagnetic sensors\u2019 [15] for learning and reproduction. The positioning principle and algorithms used in our research are  basically the same. The difference is that the reference system can only support motion detection of two fingers (thumb and index) (Fig. 3.2(a)), while our research supports detection of all postures and movements involved in the entire hand.\nA second generation PCB extended board for our SBC is designed and applied in the whole architecture, and with the connections by Qwiic cables between sensors and PCB, the stability and reliability of the device is improved. Since the outputs of our chosen 9-axis IMU and magnetic sensors are digital, we adopt I2C communication method to keep reading data at a high speed.\n3.2 Architecture Design\n\tThe overall design architecture of our system is to fix a magnetic sensor on each fingertips and also one magnetic sensor with SBC and permanent magnet on the dorsal side of the hand to detect finger motions (Fig. 3.1). Since the magnetic moment of the  permanent magnet has to be big enough to ensure the effective detecting distance, which resulting to be much heavier than sensor chip, our architecture design can effectively reduce the weight of the equipment and ensuring the atability of components during experiment and  measurement process do not cause systematic errors due to shaking.\n'continue'\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ok, please continue."}]}]}], "numConvs": 3}, {"summary": "The user asked to summarize messages from the listener's perspective, following specific instructions on handling and formatting the summaries.
