When a chatbot\u2014powered by OpenAI\u2019s GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) technology\u2014sends a user\u2019s input to the OpenAI server, the server processes the data and responds accordingly.

User Interaction: The user types an input and presses Enter.\n2. Sending Request: The chatbot sends this input to the OpenAI server as a request.\n3. Server Processing: The OpenAI server processes this request. This involves understanding the input, generating an appropriate response, and preparing to send this data back.\n4. Status Codes: The server sends a response back to the chatbot. This response can include:\n- HTTP Status Codes: Indicative of the request\u2019s success or failure. For example, 200 OK for success, 400 Bad Request for a client error, or 500 Internal Server Error for a server problem.\n- Response Body: Usually contains the generated text, which is the chatbot\u2019s reply to the user\u2019s input. It may also include error messages or details, especially if the request wasn\u2019t successful.\n\n5.

While my previous response gave a general overview of how chatbot interactions with the OpenAI server work, it seems there might still be some confusion or a request for more details.\n\n### Regarding Status Code:\n\nWhen communicating with the OpenAI server (or any server), the status code is an integral part of the HTTP response indicating the result of the requested operation. Here are a few more common ones you might encounter in this context:\n\n- 200 OK: The request has succeeded, and the response contains the generated content.\n- 400 Bad Request: The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax (e.g., missing required parameters).\n- 401 Unauthorized: The request lacks valid authentication details, meaning it\u2019s missing or has an incorrect API key.\n- 403 Forbidden: The request is valid, but the server is refusing action (usually due to access rights).\n- 404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future.\n- 429 Too Many Requests: The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (\u201crate limiting\u201d).\n- 500 Internal Server Error: The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.\n\n### Regarding Parameters:\n\nParameters are additional pieces of information sent in the request to the OpenAI server, which can customize the behavior or response of the API. Here is more detail on each:\n\n- prompt: This is the text input you supply that the AI model will generate a response to. It sets the context or question for the AI.\n- temperature: This controls the randomness of the output. Lower values make the response more deterministic, while higher values allow for more varied responses.\n- max_tokens: This specifies the maximum length of the generated response. The server uses this to know when to stop generating more content.\n\n#### Example of a Detailed Request JSON Body:\n\n\n{\n\u201cprompt\u201d: \u201cWhat is the capital of France?\u201d,\n\u201ctemperature\u201d: 0.5,\n\u201cmax_tokens\u201d: 60\n}\n\n\nThis JSON structure is sent to the API to generate a response based on the given prompt, with a degree of creativity or randomness controlled by the temperature, and limiting the response length with max_tokens.\n\nIf you need further assistance or have more questions about OpenAI\u2019s API, its parameters, or how to handle its responses effectively, feel free to ask!\n\u201cWhat is the capital of France?\u201d. londan\nThe capital of France is Paris, not London.

The room was also smaller and less comfortable than we had anticipated, which added to our disappointment.\n\nDespite the setbacks, we tried to make the most of the situation. We explored nearby indoor attractions like museums and tried out local restaurants. It wasn't the sunny beach vacation we had envisioned, but we still managed to create some fun memories together.\n\nLooking back, it taught us to be more flexible and adaptable during future trips.

It seeks a declaration that the Core Decision was unlawful and an order\nquashing it.\nFactual background\n[4] The Property is located adjacent to State Highway 96 between Ohai and\nNightcaps, with flat rolling hill country topography. Bathurst owns and operates the\nTakitimu coal mine near Nightcaps. The pit at Takitimu has limited remaining coal\nresources which are expected soon to be exhausted. In close proximity to Takitimu is\na known coal deposit, commonly referred to as \u201cNew Brighton\u201d, which sits beneath\nthe Property. Bathurst has been considering the New Brighton deposit as a possible\neconomic option to meet continuing demand.\n[5] In December 2020, Bathurst approached the Council to discuss exploration and\npotential mine development on the Property (the Proposal). Following initial\ndiscussions, by letter on 25 January 2021, Bathurst:\n(a) provided notice under s 59 Crown Minerals Act 1991 (CMA) that New\nBrighton intended to obtain an access arrangement for the purpose of\nexploration over the Property; and\n(b) asked the Council to make an in-principle decision in relation to an\naccess arrangement for mining, subject to the results of drilling that\nwould be undertaken.\n[6] The Proposal was considered by Council staff including the Governance and\nDemocracy Manager, the Commercial Infrastructure Manager, the team leader for\nresource management, and the Council\u2019s policy analyst. Staff also sought independent\nexternal advice on the Proposal.\n[7] Officers then prepared a report (the \u201cRecommendation Report\u201d) for\nconsideration by the Services and Assets Committee of the Council (the Committee)\nat the 23 March 2021 meeting.\n[8] The Council had in place a Significance and Engagement Policy (S&E Policy)\n(discussed below from [38]). In the Recommendation Report, the Committee directly\naddressed the significance of the Proposal under a heading \u201cAssessment of\nSignificance\u201d, which read:\n45 This issue could be considered to have some impact for \u201cthe current\nand future social, economic, environmental or cultural wellbeing of\nthe district or region\u201d as per Council\u2019 current Significant [sic] and\nEngagement Policy. However, the matter specifically relates to a\nparticular block of Council\u2019s commercial forest estate, rather than a\nbroader scale policy at a district, community or even forest estate as a\nwhole.\n46 Although there may possibly be a high degree of interest in this issue\nfrom the community and affected stakeholders, not all interested\nparties will necessarily be directly impacted or face consequences. For\nthis reason, the matter may not be considered significant, although is\npossibly approaching a significance threshold.\n[9] The Recommendation Report contained a discussion of \u201cCommunity Views\u201d.\nThe Council staff there noted:\n34 Community views have not been sought with respect to this issue and\nno specific engagement activities have taken place. Staff anticipate\nthe community holding a wide range of views on this topic so there is\na high risk that any engagement exercise would be inconclusive.\nFurther, if the decision is escalated to the Ministry level, there is a risk\nthat the weight of local views would be diminished.\n35 Community views would be considered through the resource consent\nprocess associated with mine development.\n(\u201cthe 14 April Community View discussion\u201d)\n[10] The Recommendation Report made the following recommendations:\nThat the Services and Assets Committee:\n(a) Receives the report titled \u201cAccess to Commercial Forest at Ohai for\nCoal Exploration and Mining\u201d dated 16 March 2021.\n(b) Determines that this matter or decision be recognised \u201cas not\u201d\nsignificant in terms of Section 76 of the Local Government Act 2002.\n(c) Determines that it has complied with the decision-making provisions\nof the Local Government Act 2002 to the extent necessary in relation\nto this decision; and in accordance with Section 79 of the Act\ndetermines that it does not require further information, further\nassessment of options or further analysis of costs and benefits or\nadvantages and disadvantages prior to making a decision on this\nmatter.\n(d) Agrees to consider the three options available for coal exploration\naccess to Ohai commercial forest and note that whichever option is\nchosen will be of neutral cost impact to Council.\n(e) Agrees to recommend to Council that officers proceed with one of the\noptions below:\n(i) Option 1 \u2013 Enter into access agreement for exploration and\nagree, subject to negotiation, to an access agreement for mine\ndevelopment; or\n(ii) Option 2 \u2013 Enter into access agreement for exploration but do\nnot agree at this stage to further mine development, instead\nallowing for consideration of community views; or\n(iii) Option 3 \u2013 do not enter into access agreement for exploration\nnor an access agreement for mine development.\n(f) Agrees that if the Committee determines to recommend Option 1 or\n2, that it also recommends to Council that the Group Manager of\nServices and Assets is delegated to execute such an agreement.\n[11] On 23 March 2021, the Committee met to consider the Recommendation\nReport. The Committee was made up of all Councillors and was chaired by the Deputy\nMayor. Due to uncertainty regarding whether the Committee had the necessary\ndelegated authority, it was decided that the Committee should make a recommendation\nto Council on the Proposal and that the Council would make a final decision. The\nRecommendation Report was treated as confidential and was considered with the\npublic excluded from the meeting. Before the public were excluded, New Brighton\u2019s\nrepresentatives presented to the Committee their proposed exploration activities, and\ndescribed the potential mining operation and their activities in Southland generally.\n[12] Committee members discussed the Recommendation Report and the issues.\nMembers discussed the community views that were held or were likely to be held; the\nimportance of mining activities to local communities, business and the economy; and\nclimate change impacts of entering into the access arrangement.\n[13] At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee adopted recommendations\n(a) to (d) and (e)(i), ((e)(i) being \u201cOption 1\u201d) (set out at [10] above). It also adopted\nrecommendation (f) with changes:\nAgrees that if the Committee determines to recommend Option 1 or 2, that it\nalso recommends to Council that the Group Manager of Services and Assets,\nChief Executive and Chair of the Services and Assets Committee are is\ndelegated to execute such an agreement.\n[14] The Committee forwarded its recommendation to the Council as an amended\nversion of the Recommendation Report (amended so as to reflect the Committee\u2019s\nconclusions).\n[15] The Council met on 14 April 2021 to consider the Proposal and the\nCommittee\u2019s Recommendation. The Committee\u2019s report to Council, entitled \u201cAccess\nto Commercial Forest at Ohai for Coal Exploration and Mining\u201d (the Committee\nReport), was identical in all material respects to the Recommendation Report, aside \nfrom the \u201cRecommendation\u201d section, which was amended to reflect the\nrecommendation made by the Committee.\n[16] The Committee Report was discussed by the Council, with many of the topics\nand context discussed at the Committee again covered, and some additional\ncomments. The Council\u2019s Group Manager, Matthew Russell, has provided an affidavit\nas to his involvement in the relation to the Proposal and, in particular, at the Committee\nmeeting (23 March) and at the Council meeting (14 April). Mr Russell deposes that\nthe Council discussed the following matters (along with others):\n(a) the Council\u2019s understanding of what views the community would hold\nregarding the Proposal;\n(b) whether community engagement on the Proposal was necessary;\n(c) the impact on climate change if the Council were to grant access for\nmining; and\n(d) the ability of New Brighton to request an arbitrator determine the access\narrangement if the Council did not consent to the Proposal and the\npotential that, if the matter is referred to arbitration, the Council might\nlose the ability to ensure New Brighton goes through a fully-notified\nconsent application process.\n[17] Under a heading \u201cCommunity Views\u201d the Committee adopted and set out from\nthe Recommendation Report the 14 April Community View discussion.\n1\n[18] The Committee Report describes the decision-making as taking place in the\ncontext of \u201clikely mine development\u201d. The Council treated it as confidential. The\npublic were excluded from the 14 April meeting. The Report referred to the matter as\na \u201cclimate change decision\u201d from a policy perspective and recorded that:\nThere is limited strategy or framework regarding climate change that would\nguide this particular decision. This may compound the impact or precedent\n1 Above at [9].\nfrom this decision with respect to future climate change decisions. Because\nof this, the matter has a risk of being considered a test decision.\n[19] Of the three options earlier identified by Council officers (above at [10]), the\nCommittee recommended to Council Option 1 (entry into access agreement for\nexploration and, subject to negotiation, to an access agreement for mine development).\n[20] At the 14 April meeting, the Council resolved:\nThat the Council:\n(a) Receives the report titled \u201cAccess to Commercial Forest at Ohai for\nCoal Exploration and Mining\u201d dated 7 April 2021.\n(b) Determines that this matter or decision be recognised \u201cas not\u201d\nsignificant in terms of Section 76 of the Local Government Act 2002.\n(c) Determines that it has complied with the decision-making provisions\nof the Local Government Act 2002 to the extent necessary in relation\nto this decision; and in accordance with Section 79 of the Act\ndetermines that it does not require further information, further\nassessment of options or further analysis of costs and benefits or\nadvantages and disadvantages prior to making a decision on this\nmatter.\n(d) Agrees to consider the three options available for coal exploration\naccess to Ohai commercial forest and note that whichever option is\nchosen will be of neutral cost impact to Council.\n(e) Agrees that officers proceed to \u2013 enter into an access agreement for\nexploration and agree, subject to negotiation, to an access agreement\nfor mine development and with the condition that the applicant applies\nfor a publicly notified resource consent.\n(f) Agrees that the group manager of Services and Assets, chief executive\nand chair of the Services and Assets Committee are delegated to\nexecute such an agreement.\n(the Decision).\n[21] Accordingly, in reaching the Decision the Council found the matter not to be\nsignificant in terms of its S&E Policy and determined under s 79 Local Government\nAct (LGA) it did not require further information.\n[22] The Decision was effected by the Council and New Brighton executing a\ncontract entitled \u201cExploration Access Arrangement\u201d dated 5 May 2021 (Access \nAgreement). The access rights for exploration recorded in the Access Agreement were\nregistered over the titles to the relevant land, as provided for by s 83 CMA. The Access\nAgreement had a defined term, commencing on 5 May 2021 and expiring 30 June\n2022. New Brighton in fact concluded its exploration activities in August 2021. The\nAccess Agreement contained an acknowledgement as to the capacity in which the\nCouncil entered it:\n[7.2] [New Brighton] acknowledges that [the Council] has entered into this\nAgreement in its capacity as a landowner and nothing in this Agreement or\nrepresentation made by or on behalf of [the Council] binds [the Council] in its\nregulatory capacity as a consenting authority under the [Resource\nManagement Act] in respect of the [Property] or in the exercise of any of its\npowers under its bylaws.\nForest & Bird\u2019s application for review\n[23] By its application for judicial review, Forest & Bird sought a declaration that\nthe Decision was unlawful and an order quashing the Decision.\n[24] For a first cause of action Forest & Bird pleaded that there had been a number\nof errors of law, which were then grouped in counsel\u2019s submissions \u2014 I consider them\nin this judgment under the following headings:\n(a) failure to act in accordance with s 14 LGA principles ([53]\u2013[80]);\n(b) failure to properly apply the S&E Policy ([81]\u2013[98]);\n(c) failure to consider community views as preferences under s 78 LGA\n([99]\u2013[119]);\n(d) failure to consider the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate\nchange ([120]\u2013[130]);\n(e) failure to take account of Council plans and policies and the LGLCC\nDeclaration ([131]\u2013[145]);\n(f) legally erroneous reasoning as to a \u201closs of control\u201d ([146]\u2013[155]); and\n(g) legally erroneous reasoning through Council\u2019s failure to inform itself\n([156]\u2013[161]).\n[25] As a second cause of action, Forest & Bird pleaded that the Council had acted\nunreasonably by making the Decision because \u201cit is unreasonable to facilitate the\nexpansion of coalmining operations in the District in view of identified climate change\nconsiderations\u201d. This ground of review is discussed below at [162]\u2013[174].\nStrike-out application\n[26] New Brighton applied on 31 August 2021 for an order striking out Forest &\nBird\u2019s statement of claim. On 4 November 2021, Associate Judge Johnston, following\na hearing, declined to rule on the strike-out application. He directed instead that the\napplication be heard together with the substantive judicial review application.\n2 The\nAssociate Judge reasoned that the necessary consideration of the merits meant that the\nCourt would need to have all available affidavit evidence before it before reaching a\nconcluded view on the merits. At this hearing Mr Gordon has not pressed for a\ndetermination of the interlocutory application and it will be formally dismissed given\nthe Court is determining the issues substantively. Accordingly, there will be no costs\nawarded in relation to the interlocutory application.\nLegislative schemes\n[27] Two legislative schemes are relevant.\nCrown Minerals Act 1991 (CMA)\n[28] The CMA establishes a statutory regime in relation to Crown-owned minerals.\nThe responsible Minister may issue permits in relation to prospecting, exploring, or\nmining for minerals.3\n New Brighton holds permits for prospecting and exploration in\nrelation to the Property.4\n Section 54(2) CMA requires a permit holder, before any\nprospecting, exploring or mining takes place on the identified land, to obtain an access\n2 Royal Forest & Bird Protection Society of New Zealand Inc v Southland District Council [2021]\nNZHC 2977 at [35].\n3 Crown Minerals Act, s 25.\n4 Minerals Exploration Permit 40625 \u2014 permits to prospect and explore for Crown owned mineral.\nNew Brighton does not hold a permit to mine in relation to the Property.\narrangement either through agreement with each owner and occupier of the land or by\nan arbitrator\u2019s determination. For minerals other than petroleum (such as coal) there\nare special requirements to be met before the alternative of an arbitrator\u2019s\ndetermination may be adopted. I return to that below from [146].\n[29] In this case, Bathurst sought and obtained (in the form of the Access\nAgreement) an agreement in writing with the Council, in the Council\u2019s capacity as the\nowner of the Property.\nLocal Government Act 2002 (LGA)\n[30] The Council is a \u201cterritorial authority\u201d in terms of the LGA. As such, the\nCouncil\u2019s operations are subject to the provisions of the LGA. As described in s 3 of\nthe LGA, the LGA does four things in particular in order to provide for democratic\nand effective local government that recognises the diversity of New Zealand\ncommunities, namely:\n(a) states the purpose of local government; and\n(b) provides a framework and powers for local authorities to decide which\nactivities they undertake and the manner in which they will undertake\nthem; and\n(c) promotes the accountability of local authorities to their communities;\nand\n(d) provides for local authorities to play a broad role in promoting the\nsocial, economic, environmental, and cultural well-being of their\ncommunities, taking a sustainable development approach.\n[31] Central to concerns raised by Fish & Game is the proposition that the four\ncommunity \u201cwell-beings\u201d identified in s 3(d) LGA (being social, economic,\nenvironmental and cultural) were neglected by the Council when making the Decision\nand entering into the access arrangements.\nThe climate change context\n[32] Forest & Bird asserts that the Decision was unlawful because in various ways\nthe Decision disregarded the contribution the extraction and use of coal from the \nProperty would have on climate change. Mr McDonald summarised the proposition\nin his introductory submissions:\nThe Council\u2019s decision was improperly made as a matter of procedure and in\nthe context of a phenomenon that is one of the most critical issues of our time.\nAnthropogenic climate change has profound implications for the Southland\nDistrict (District) and those who live there.\nThe extraction and use of coal to generate energy is a major contributor to\nclimate change. Facilitating new coal mining operations is inconsistent with\nthe urgent action required to keep global heating at safe levels.\nForest & Bird says that the Council\u2019s decision-making process was\nfundamentally flawed, and that the decision was unreasonable as a matter of\nlaw.\n[33] By an introductory paragraph to its statement of claim, Forest & Bird also\nrelated its claims to the impact of activities upon climate:\nThis application is concerned with the preservation of New Zealand\u2019s natural\nenvironment and it is brought solely in the public interest, having regard to\nthe urgent need to reduce the impact of human activity on the climate.\n[34] By its statement of claim, Forest & Bird then pleaded matters under headings\n\u201cScientific consensus on climate change\u201d, \u201cCoal\u2019s contribution to climate change\u201d and\n\u201cImpacts of climate change on the Southland District\u201d.\n[35] Mr McDonald\u2019s introductory submissions (above at [32]) broadly summarised\nthe \u201cscientific consensus\u201d pleadings which contained assertions that:\n(a) youth and future generations will be disproportionately affected by the\nimpacts of climate change;\n(b) the Southland District and its communities will be significantly\nimpacted by the effects of climate change; and\n(c) New Zealand\u2019s transition to zero net carbon by 2050 can be achieved\nonly if coal use is rapidly phased out.\n[36] Forest & Bird supported its application through five deponents:\n(a) Rick Zwaan, the Regional Conservation Manager (Otago/Southland) of\nForest & Bird. He exhibited documents of the Council and other bodies\nand information relating to the Decision;\n(b) Gemma Marnane \u2014 the National Communications Manager at Forest\n& Bird Youth \u2014 as a 20 year old, with a strong connection to Southland\nand its communities. She deposed as to the concerns that she and other\nyoung people have for the future and in particular the concern that\nactivities such as coal mining will have negative environmental impacts\non the district, outweighing any short-term economic benefit;\n(c) George Curzon-Hobson \u2014 the Chief Policy Lead at Forest & Bird\nYouth \u2014 as a 17 year old, he deposed as to his work on environmental\nmatters, the immense alarm the climate crisis has for many young\npeople and the strong objection that Forest & Bird Youth has to the\nCouncil allowing access for coal exploration and/or development of\nmining operations at Ohai;\n(d) Professor Timothy Naish \u2014 he deposed, as a climate and earth scientist,\nas to his expertise and as to what he understands to be the consensus of\nthe global scientific community on the causes and effects of climate\nchange and required mitigation steps. He referred to the contribution\nof fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes to total greenhouse\ngas emissions and to the work of the (New Zealand) Climate Change\nCommission \u2014 its demonstration pathway for electricity generation\nand industrial heating shows coal being phased out by 2025 and\nreduced by 80 per cent in food processing by 2035. He stated that New\nZealand\u2019s transition to zero net carbon by 2050 can only be achieved if\ncoal use is phased out (replaced by biofuels). He said climate change\nwill disproportionately affect youth and future generations, and there\nwill be significant ramifications for Southland. In an updating affidavit,\nhe referred to further work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\nChange (IPCC) as strengthening understanding that all aspects of the\nclimate system are being influenced by continued emissions of \ngreenhouse gases. He set out statistics relating to the burning of coal\nworldwide and opined that the immediate decarbonisation of the energy\nsector is central to all mitigation pathways that keep earth\u2019s climate\nwhen in safe operating limits;\n(e) Professor (Emeritus) Ralph Sims \u2014 a scientist who has been a lead\nauthor for four IPCC reports. He opined that the expansion or\ndevelopment of new coalmining operations anywhere in the world is\nentirely irresponsible from a climate change perspective. He stated\nthere is no need to develop any new coalmines either globally or in New\nZealand and that there are sufficient reserves and supply of coal already\navailable from existing lines to meet the requirements of industry\nduring the phasing out of coal as an energy source for industrial\nprocesses and power generations. He referred to observations made\nduring the (Southland District) Council\u2019s decision-making process as\nto the potential importation of coal to meet New Zealand\u2019s domestic\nrequirement \u2014 he stated New Zealand has proven technically and\neconomic recoverable coal reserves that would last for 2000 years at\nannual consumption rates. He rejected any suggestion that any product\n(whether New Zealand coal or other) can be defined as \u201cclean coal\u201d.\nHe took issue with a statement of Craig Pilcher, wherein Mr Pilcher\nreferred to a Ministry for the Environment (the Ministry) document\n(April 2021) as \u201cproviding for the use of coal until at least 2037\u201d.\nProfessor Sims explained it is the consultation document which in fact\nsets out proposals to put in place a clear \u201cphase out\u201d date for the use of\ncoal in low and medium process heat by 2037. He noted the\nconsultation document confirms that \u201cphasing out the use of coal in\nprocess heat is the priority\u201d and that \u201cone of the biggest opportunities\nto reduce CO2 emissions in Aotearoa is through the decarbonisation of\nprocessed heat\u201d.\nThe respondents\u2019 pleadings\n[37] The respondents, by their respective statements of defence, admitted the\npleadings as to the existence of climate change, the significant contribution of energy\nto greenhouse gas emissions and that coal currently makes up a portion of the global\nprimary energy supply. They plead insufficient knowledge of other detailed\nallegations and therefore deny those. New Brighton, in particular, pleads that New\nZealand has an intended transition to a zero net carbon economy but pleads that such\na target will take time to achieve, with the energy needs of New Zealand\u2019s economy\nstill needing to be met during the transition.\n[38] New Brighton pleaded two affirmative defences:\n(a) the Decision is not unreasonable because it is the decision of a private\nlandowner to enter into a commercial contract; and\n(b) review would be futile and the issues raised are moot because the\nagreed exploration has been completed and any mining is dependent\nupon other authorisation, including a resource consent which would\nitself proceed on a fully-notified basis.\nOther policy/declarations\nLGA regime for \u201csignificant decisions\u201d\n[39] Section 76 LGA provides for decision-making, including in relation to\n\u201csignificant decisions\u201d (under s 76(3)(b)).\n[40] \u201cSignificant\u201d, pursuant to s 5, LGA means in relation to a decision, one that\nhas a high degree of significance.\nSignificance and Engagement Policy\n[41] Section 76AA LGA requires every local authority to adopt an S&E policy.\n[42] The purpose of an S&E policy is:5\n(a) to enable the local authority and its communities to identify the degree\nof significance attached to particular issues, proposals, assets,\ndecisions, and activities; and\n(b) to provide clarity about how and when communities can expect to be\nengaged in decisions about different issues, assets, or other matters;\nand\n(c) to inform the local authority from the beginning of a decision-making\nprocess about\u2014\n(i) the extent of any public engagement that is expected before a\nparticular decision is made; and\n(ii) the form or type of engagement required.\n[43] A policy adopted under s 76AA(1) LGA may be amended from time to time.6\n[44] The Council adopted its S&E Policy on 10 March 2021.\n[45] The S&E Policy says that the Council will follow a three-step process to inform\ndecision-making:\n[46] Council will follow a three-step process to inform decision-making:\nStep 1 - determine significance - Council will use particular factors to decide\nif a matter is of higher or lower significance. This part of the policy also gives\nguidance on what to do if a matter is of high significance.\nStep 2 - identify community views - Council will determine what it knows\nabout community views and identify if there is a need for more information.\nStep 3 - deciding on an approach to community engagement - the level of\nsignificance and what Council wants to know about community views will\nguide Council on an appropriate level of engagement, and how and when to\nengage. This part of the policy provides clarity on how and when communities\ncan expect to be engaged in different issues. It also identifies how Council\nwill respond to community preferences about engagement.\n5 Local Government Act 2002, s 76AA(2).\n6 Section 76AA(4).\n[47] The S&E Policy at Step 1 states that decisions will be considered on a case by\ncase basis, with the following factors of equal weighting to be taken into account:\n(a) the likely impact/consequences of the issue, decision or proposal on\nthe current and future social, economic, environmental or cultural\nwellbeing of the District.\n(b) the effect on people who are likely to be particularly affected by or\ninterested in the issue, decision or proposal.\n(c) the financial and non-financial costs and implications of the issue,\ndecision or proposal on Council\u2019s capability and capacity.\n(d) the scale of any proposed change to levels of service.\n(e) the ownership or function of a strategic asset.\n[48] Forest & Bird identifies factors (a) and (b) as particularly applicable to the\nCouncil\u2019s decision-making in this case. It is common ground that factors (d) and (e)\nhad no application.\n[49] The S&E Policy also requires the Council to also take into account knowledge\nit has previously gained about the community and its views on an issue in order to\nassess whether the matter has a high level of significance.\n[50] The S&E Policy also states, under a heading \u201cFor some matters that are not\nconsidered significant\u201d:\nIn general, where a matter is not considered significant under this policy,\nCouncil is unlikely to seek additional information on community views.\nHowever, in some situations where Council staff deem community\ninvolvement or notification is appropriate, informal feedback or notification\nprocesses may be followed.\nLocal Government Leaders\u2019 Climate Change Declaration\n[51] In 2017, a group of 40 local authority mayors and chairs joined in signing the\nLocal Government Leaders\u2019 Climate Change Declaration (\u201cLGLCC Declaration\u201d).\nThe Mayor of Southland District (Gary Tong) was one of the signatories. By its\npleading Forest & Bird asserted (incorrectly) the Council is a signatory to the LGLCC\nDeclaration \u2014 the Mayor was the signatory and the Council (of Southland District)\nhas not in fact resolved to adopt the Declaration.\n[52] That said, Forest & Bird invokes aspects of the LGLCC Declaration as matters\nthe Council was required to consider when reaching the Decision. In particular, the\nDeclaration contains an acknowledgment of the importance and urgent need to address\nclimate change for the benefit of current and future generations. It also contains\n\u201cCouncil Commitments\u201d to developing and implementing ambitious action plans that\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions and sets out important \u201cguiding principles\u201d for\nresponding to climate change, including precaution; stewardship and kaitiakitanga;\nequity and justice; understanding; and co-operation and resilience.\nFirst ground of review \u2013 failure to act in accordance with s 14 LGA principles\nForest & Bird\u2019s pleading\n[53] Forest & Bird pleads the Council erred by failing to consider, or making errors\nin the consideration of, the statutorily mandatory considerations in s 14 LGA.\nThe s 14 LGA regime\n[54] Section 14(1) LGA lists a set of principles relating to local authorities. The\nthree invoked by Forest & Bird being in (1), (b) (c) and (h) relevantly read:\n14 Principles relating to local authorities\n(1) In performing its role, a local authority must act in accordance with\nthe following principles:\n\u2026\n(b) a local authority should make itself aware of, and should have\nregard to, the views of all of its communities; and\n(c) when making a decision, a local authority should take account\nof\u2014\n(i) the diversity of the community, and the community\u2019s\ninterests, within its district or region; and\n(ii) the interests of future as well as current communities;\nand\n(iii) the likely impact of any decision on each aspect of\nwell-being referred to in section 10:\n\u2026\n(h) in taking a sustainable development approach, a local\nauthority should take into account\u2014\n(i) the social, economic, and cultural well-being of\npeople and communities; and\n(ii) the need to maintain and enhance the quality of the\nenvironment; and\n(iii) the reasonably foreseeable needs of future\ngenerations.\n[55] Section 78 LGA requires the local authority, in the course of its decisionmaking process in relation to a matter, to give consideration to the views and\npreferences of persons likely to be affected by, or to have an interest in, the matters.\n[56] The application of the principles identified in s 14 LGA is provided for in\ns 79(2)(a) LGA. Section 79(1) makes it the responsibility of a local authority to make,\nin its discretion, judgements about how to achieve compliance with the\ndecision-making requirements under ss 77 and 78 that is largely in proportion to the\nsignificance of the matters affected by the decision. Section 79(2) then provides that\nthe local authority, in making judgements under s 79(1), must have regard to the\nsignificance of all relevant matters and (amongst other matters) the principles set out\nin s 14 LGA.\n[57] Section 80 LGA requires the local authority when making a decision, if its\ndecision is significantly inconsistent with any policy adopted by the local authority, or\nany plan requires by statute, to clearly identify the inconsistency and the reasons for\nit.\nSubmissions\n[58] For Forest & Bird, Mr McDonald, invoked the s 79(2) provision that the local\nauthority \u201cmust have regard\u201d to the principles set out in s 14. He submitted the s 14\nrequirements are thereby express mandatory considerations. Mr McDonald submitted\nthat, in the way the Council approached its decision-making, its focus was on coal\u2019s\nmajor contribution and impact in the District and on the Council facilitating mining\non its own land. Under the \u201cadvantages\u201d identified under the Committee\u2019s Option 1,\nthere was listed \u201csupports significant District employer and related communities\u201d. In \nthis way, in Mr McDonald\u2019s submission, the Council addressed only half the picture\nrequired for decision-making.\n[59] Mr McDonald submitted the Council neglected to have regard to the principles\nhe identified in s 14 through a failure to focus on the impact of the mining of coal\nagainst the immediate need for de-carbonisation, not only at a national but also a\nregional level. In Mr McDonald\u2019s submission, the Council (in terms of s 14) failed to\nhave proper regard to the views of all its communities, the interests of future as well\nas current communities, and a sustainable development approach that has regard to the\nfour community \u201cwell-beings\u201d (above at [31]).\n[60] Mr McDonald submitted the Council had very little latitude for error when\nmaking the Decision. Mr McDonald cited the observations of Palmer J in Hauraki\nCoromandel Climate Action Inc v Thames-Coromandel District Council (Hauraki\nCCA) that the intensity of review of decisions about climate change by public\ndecision-makers is similar to that for fundamental human rights.7\n His Honour\nremarked that, depending on their context, decisions about climate change deserve\nheightened scrutiny.\n[61] That said, Mr McDonald submitted it does not require a \u201cheightened scrutiny\u201d\nfor the Decision to be found unlawful in this case by reference to a breach of s 14\nprinciples, as that breach is simply one of a number.\n[62] Both Mr Conway and Mr Gordon (for the Council and New Brighton\nrespectively) took issue with Forest & Bird\u2019s characterisation of s 14 as containing\n\u201cmandatory requirements\u201d and of the proposition that \u201cheightened scrutiny\u201d is to be\napplied to this Decision. They submitted the Council, as it acted, had applied the s 14\nprinciples.\nDiscussion \u2014 \u201cmandatory requirements\u201d\n[63] The role of s 14 LGA in the context of the LGA as a whole requires\nconsideration. The LGA, as it now exists (in the form of the 2002 Act), stands in\n7 Hauraki Coromandel Climate Action Inc v Thames-Coromandel District Council [2020] NZHC\n3228, [2021] 3 NZLR 280 [Hauraki CCA] at [51].\ncontrast to the predecessor legislation (the Local Government Act 1974 and the\nMunicipal Corporations Act 1954) which were highly prescriptive and contained\ndetailed powers and obligations for many of local authorities\u2019 functions. Such was\nexplained in the Explanatory Note to the Local Government Bill 2001, which spoke\nof a:8\n\u2026 shift from a detailed and prescriptive style of statute (that focuses councils\non compliance with detailed legislative rules) to a more broadly empowering\nlegislative framework that focuses councils on meeting the needs of their\ncommunities.\n[64] Hence s 12(2) LGA which cloaks local authorities with a general power of\ncompetence, constrained by the purpose of local government (under s 10) and (under\ns 11) the role of a local authority. Subject to those constraints, a local authority has\nfull capacity to do anything a body corporate may do so long as it is:9\n(a) for the purpose of performing its statutory role;\n(b) wholly or principally for the benefit of its district or regime; and\n(c) not contrary to the LGA, any other Act, or the general law.\n[65] Part 6 of the LGA (particularly ss 75-83) sets out specific provisions in relation\nto local authority decision-making. Part 6 does not generally prescribe or limit\nsubstantive powers but rather sets out procedural requirements that apply in the\nexercise of those powers.\n[66] Section 79 LGA (summarised at [56] above) provides direction to local\nauthorities on how to comply with their decision-making obligations. Section 79(1)(a)\nmakes local authorities responsible, in their discretion, for making judgements as to\nhow to comply with ss 77 and 78 requirements in a way that is \u201clargely in proportion\nto the significance of the matters affected by the decision\u201d, determined in accordance\nwith the S&E Policy (as adopted under s 76AA LGA). Section 79(2) does not require\nthe local authority to have regard to s 14 principles when making decisions \u2014 the\n8 Local Government Bill 2001 (191-1) (Explanatory Note).\n9 LGA, s 12(2)\u2013(5).\nrequirement is focused on the discretionary judgements the local authority makes\nunder s 79(1) about how to achieve compliance with s 77 and 78.\n[67] Against this background, unsurprisingly counsel did not refer to any decision\nbased purely on a breach of s 14. The reason for that has been explained academically:\n(a) In Kenneth Palmer\u2019s Local Government Law in New Zealand, the\nauthor describes s 14 as containing statements of principle which may\nbe useful in interpreting or applying other provisions of the Act, rather\nthan quantifiable requirements; and10\n(b) Dr Dean Knight has observed that \u201cit is expected that [the Courts] will\nfence off these principles as being non-justiciable and point to the\nprocesses of political accountability as being the central control\nmechanism to enforce compliance\u201d.11\nIn other words, councillors are to be held accountable for the implementation of s 14\nprinciples through the ballot box at election time rather than through review in this\nCourt.\n[68] Very recently, in All Aboard Aotearoa Inc v Auckland Transport, one challenge\nwas to a decision of the Auckland Council\u2019s Planning Committee endorsing the\nRegional Land Transport Plan.12\n The applicant challenged the Planning Committee\u2019s\nendorsement on the basis that the Committee did not have proper regard to the interests\nof the future as well as current communities as required under s 14 LGA.13\n Venning J\nidentified the status of the s 14 principles:14\nI agree with the respondents\u2019 submission that the principles in s 14 of the LGA\nare not mandatory requirements enforceable in their own right, but rather are\na guide to the Council\u2019s exercise of its powers and functions.\n10 Kenneth Palmer (ed) A to Z of New Zealand Law (online ed, Thomson Reuters) at 37.5.10.1.\n11 Dean Knight \u201cDemocracy and the Consideration of Community Views: Obligation and\nObservance\u201d in C Charters, Dean R Knight (ed) We, The People\u2019s: Participation in Governance\n(Victoria University Press, Wellington, 2011) at 284.\n12 All Aboard Aotearoa Inc v Auckland Transport [2022] NZHC 1620.\n13 See [219].\n14 At [220].\n[69] I respectfully adopt that passage as correctly stating the law.\n[70] It was against the background of this empowering legislative framework that\nthe Council came to consider the decision it had to make as a landowner under the\nCMA. The Decision was being made because New Brighton, as a holder of permits\nfor prospecting and exploration (but not mining) in relation to the Property, had\nrequested a grant of right of access under s 59 CMA over the Council\u2019s land. The\nCouncil, in responding to that request, was not exercising any regulatory power. The\nrequest made of the Council for access to the Property under the CMA was a prerequisite to New Brighton gaining access to the land (for any of the identified\npurposes, namely prospecting, exploring or mining). But the decision to grant access\ndid not in any legal or logical sense amount to an approval, let alone a permission, to\nmine for coal. Nor was it a decision as to the Council\u2019s position on any issue relating\nto climate change. Such was reflected in New Brighton\u2019s acknowledgement expressly\ncontained in the Access Agreement (above at [22]). The Council\u2019s required decision\nunder the CMA was as to access. The rights New Brighton needed if it was to explore\nand to mine had to be granted through other processes.\n[71] The fact the Council was granting access to the Property for stated purposes is\nof fundamental relevance to the context. The Council\u2019s decision did not authorise or\nset in motion the mining of coal on the Property. The grant of the existing permit to\nexplore and any subsequent grant of a permit to mine in relation to the Property were\n(if applied for) matters for the responsible Minister under the CMA. The consenting\nprocess for any mining activities under the RMA if applied for would be for the\nCouncil to determine in the exercise of its regulatory functions under the RMA.\nDiscussion \u2014 \u201cheightened scrutiny\u201d\n[72] Returning then to the standard of review required in relation to the Council\u2019s\ndecision-making, a focal point for recent discussion in this area has been the decision\nin Hauraki CCA.\n15 It was cited by Mr McDonald for the proposition that the gravity\n15 Hauraki CCA, above n 7, at [45].\nof the subject-matter (climate change) may require the Court to exercise \u201cheightened\nscrutiny\u201d over the decision-making and a greater \u201cintensity of review\u201d.16\n[73] The concept of a variable standard of review is not without its complications\n(as identified by Cooke J in New Zealand Council of Licensed Firearms Owners Inc v\nMinister of Police).\n17 The approach to \u201cintensity of review\u201d has not been settled.18\n[74] This is not a case which ultimately turns on the differences or tensions between\nrecent observations as to the intensity of review. The recent discussion had its origin\n(in Hauraki CCA) in an analogy drawn between cases turning on fundamental human\nrights and those focused on climate change decision-making. I have referred above at\n[51] to the LGLCC Declaration. It was the decision of a Council not to approve the\nMayor\u2019s signing of the Declaration that was the subject-matter of Hauraki CCA. The\nDeclaration contains \u201cCouncil Commitments\u201d. The decision under review in Hauraki\nCCA therefore was a \u201cdecision about climate change\u201d.19 The Court recognised that, if\nthe LGLCC Declaration were both signed by the Mayor and approved by the Council,\nthat could create a legally enforceable legitimate expectation as to how the Council\nwould in future deal with the physical impacts of climate change.\n20\n The Council was\nbeing asked to state its commitments in relation to climate change, with enforceable\nobligations potentially flowing.21\n[75] The decision in this case was not a \u201cclimate change\u201d decision in the sense that\nterm was employed in Hauraki CCA. The decision for the Council in this case was\nwhether and on what terms to grant access to its land (with one of the purposes of such\naccess (mining) having potential implications for climate change). While, to that\nextent, there was a climate change context in which the Council\u2019s access decision was\nbeing made, it is incorrect to equate the decision to a \u201cclimate change decision\u201d in the\nHauraki CCA sense.\n16 At [51].\n17 New Zealand Council of Licensed Firearms Owners Inc v Minister of Police [2020] NZHC 1456\nat [85]\u2013[85].\n18 See, for instance, Cripps v Attorney-General [2022] NZHC 1532 at [188], citing Ministry of\nJustice v Kim [2021] NZSC 57, [2021] 1 NZLR 338 at [51].\n19 At [1], [51].\n20 Hauraki CCA, above n 7, at [1].\n21 At [32].\n[76] Assuming (without deciding) that Hauraki CC correctly identifies a\nrequirement of \u201cheightened scrutiny\u201d for certain types of decisions, the decision in this\ncase was not within a relevant class. \u201cNormal\u201d scrutiny has to be applied.\nDiscussion \u2014 a failure to consider s 14 LGA Principles?\n[77] The first, fundamental answer to the first ground of review (alleged noncompliance with s 14 LGA) is that any failure of the Council to have regard to the\nnon-mandatory s 14 principles does not invalidate the Decision.\n[78] Had that not been the case, I would in any event have found that Forest & Bird\nhas not established that the Council in fact failed to consider the s 14 principles. This\nwas a decision in relation to access to land under the CMA. The Council was not the\nbody charged by statute with authorising the exploration for or mining of minerals.\nThe Council\u2019s consideration of principles therefore needed to relate to the relatively\nnarrow question of the impact of New Brighton\u2019s entry onto the land (should access\nbe granted). The Committee had expressly reported to Council (above at [9]) that\ncommunity views had not been sought, with staff anticipating (clearly correctly) the\ncommunity would hold a wide range of views on the topic of coal exploration and\nmining at Ohai. That said, the Committee recorded that there would be a consideration\nof community views through any resource consent process associated with any mine\ndevelopments.\n[79] Given the issue before the Council was the question of access, for the purposes\nof s 14 the level of regard to the diversity of community views was sufficient. Some\nwould be in favour, probably strongly. Some would be opposed, probably strongly. It\naccorded with a principled approach, in those circumstances, for the Council to take\nthe view that adverse community views, whether based on issues of anthropogenic\nclimate change or otherwise, should not cut across the narrow issue of whether to grant\naccess and that the appropriate context for further consideration of community views\nand impacts would be when (if at all) New Brighton came to seek the necessary\nconsents or permissions to extract any coal.\n[80] The Council was also entitled to take into account the consideration identified\nby the Committee (above at [13])(d)). As I find below from [146], in the event the \nCouncil refused New Brighton access, there was a statutory means under the CMA by\nwhich New Brighton could achieve through the Minister an arbitrated decision. There\nwas therefore a route, albeit of difficulty, whereby the Council might lose the ability\nto ensure New Brighton went through a fully notified consent application process. The\nCouncil\u2019s decisions to incorporate into the access agreement entered into with New\nBrighton an agreement for a publicly notified resource consent process (above at\n[16(e)) added a measure of protection of the scope for community views.\nSecond ground of review \u2013 failure to properly apply the S&E Policy\nForest & Bird\u2019s pleading\n[81] Forest & Bird pleaded the Council had failed to consider, or properly consider,\nor correctly interpret or apply its S&E Policy, the relevant provisions of which are\nsummarised at [45]\u2014[50] above.\nSubmissions\n[82] Mr McDonald submitted the Decision was plainly a matter of \u201chigh\nsignificance\u201d when assessed against the factors set out in the S&E Policy. He referred\nto three particular matters:\n(a) the impact/consequences of the Decision, when its climate change\nramifications are considered, will have a major impact on the current\nand future social, economic, environmental or cultural wellbeing of the\nDistrict;\n(b) facilitating the burning of fossil fuel, in light of the climate crisis, will\nimpact all current and future constituents of the District; and\n(c) the financial and non-financial costs of facilitating the expansion of\ncoalmining operations in the current environment will be high, given\nthe District\u2019s susceptibility to the effects of climate change, and noting\nthe billions of dollars\u2019 worth of homes, businesses and infrastructure at\nrisk.\n[83] Mr McDonald referred to Step 1 in the S&E Policy three-step process for\ndecision-making (above at [46]). He referred in particular to the requirement upon the\nCouncil, under Step 1, to consider the \u201ceffect on people who are likely to be\nparticularly affected by or interested in the issue, decision or proposal\u201d.\n[84] Mr McDonald suggested the Committee, in the Recommendation Report, had\nfocused on people who would be particularly affected or \u201cimpacted\u201d by the Decision\nand not also on people \u201cinterested in the issue\u201d.22\n He referred in particular to\nparagraph 46 of the Recommendation Report (above at [8]), which I reproduce here\nfor convenience:\nAlthough there may possibly be a high degree of interest in this issue from the\ncommunity and affected stakeholders, not all interested parties will\nnecessarily be directly impacted or face consequences. For this reason, the\nmatter may not be considered significant, although is possibly approaching a\nsignificance threshold.\n[85] Mr McDonald submitted the Council had thereby failed to apply one of the\nfactors (numbered (b)) identified at Step 1 of the S&E Policy.\n[86] Mr McDonald additionally submitted that the Council had failed to implement\nits S&E Policy by failing to secure information about the views and preferences of\nthose likely to be affected.\n[87] Mr McDonald finally submitted the Council had not properly assessed the\nsignificance of the Decision because it failed to consider four particular matters, being\nthe s 14 LGA principles; the scientific consensus on climate change; the Council\u2019s\nother policies and plans; and the LGLCC Declaration.\n[88] As I consider (and dismiss) the grounds of review relating to those four matters\nunder separate headings in this judgment, I will not further consider them under this\nheading. I instead now examine Mr McDonald\u2019s initial arguments made under this\nheading.\n22 Referring to s 78 LGA and the relevant provision of the S&E Policy (above at [47]).\n[89] For the Council, Mr Conway focused first on the Forest & Bird contention that\nthe Decision had a high degree of significance.\n[90] Mr Conway cited observations of Philip Joseph in Constitutional and\nAdministrative Law in New Zealand:\n23\nArguments of wrong weight address \u201cvalue judgments rather than questions\nof law\u201d and are prone to intrude on the decision maker\u2019s domain.\n\u2026 The ground of \u201cwrong weight\u201d may masquerade under several guises. If\nthe weighting of relevant factors is not \u201cwithin the bounds of reason\u201d, the\ndecision may be struck down as Wednesbury unreasonableness\u2026\n[91] In Mr Conway\u2019s submission, the weighting to be given to the various\nconsiderations was a matter for the Council, according to value judgements, and did\nnot involve an issue for the Court on judicial review, except in relation to the\nunreasonableness cause of action. Mr Conway emphasised the Council is required\nunder s 79(1) to exercise \u201cits discretion\u201d in relation to the judgements made under s 79\nCMA.\n[92] Mr Conway referred to the Council records, and the evidence of Mr Russell,\nas indicating the Council carefully considered the significance of the Decision against\nthe requirements of s 79(1) LGA and the S&E Policy, determining as resolution (b)\n(above at [20]) that the Decision was not \u201csignificant\u201d. Mr Conway referred to the\nexercise of judgement involved when the Recommendation Report concluded \u201cthe\nmatter may not be considered significant, although it is possibly approaching a\nsignificance threshold\u201d.\n[93] Mr Conway noted that the principles of consultation (set out in s 82 LGA) are\nnot a required consideration when a local authority is determining a decision\u2019s\nsignificance. He referred to the observation of the Court of Appeal in Wellington City\nCouncil v Minotaur Custodians Ltd (Minotaur) that the s 82 principles apply when a\ncouncil does choose to consult. In other words, the principles do not apply if the\ndecision is to not consult.24\n23 Philip A Joseph Joseph on Constitutional and Administrative Law (5\nth ed, Thomson Reuters,\nWellington, 2021) at 1017 and 1018.\n24 Wellington City Council v Minotaur Custodians Ltd [2017] NZCA 302, [2017] 3 NZLR 464\n[Minotaur]: see below at [109].\nDiscussion \u2014 the significance of the Decision\n[94] The Council had in place its S&E Policy. For identified reasons, as initially\nstated in the Recommendation Report (above at [8]), the decision Council had to make\nwas not viewed as having met the significance threshold, \u201csignificant\u201d in this context\nreferring to a decision that has a high degree of significance).25\n[95] Therefore, in terms of s 79 LGA, the Council in making, in its discretion, the\njudgement about how to achieve compliance with ss 77 and 78 had a responsibility to\nensure it was \u201clargely in proportion\u201d to the level of significance the Council found to\nbe established.\n[96] The information before the Council, both through the work of its Committee\nat the 23 March meeting and of the full Council at the 14 April meeting, plainly\nidentified the likelihood the community would hold diverse views on the Proposal.\nAll such views would be able to be considered through the resource consent process\nshould mine development be pursued. In its Report, as substantially adopted by the\nCouncil, the Committee recognised the competing sets of community interests: on the\none side in relation to a relatively high reliance on coal resource for employment and\nto provide energy for industry, while on the other side recognising that others might\nattach a higher priority to climate change considerations, including by reference to the\nrecent Climate Change Commission draft recommendations.\n[97] Mr McDonald\u2019s submission under this head focused on the distinction between\npeople likely to be particularly affected by a decision and those \u201cinterested\u201d in the\ndecision, noting the Council\u2019s reference to the fact that \u201cnot all interested parties will\nnecessarily be directly impacted or face consequences\u201d. I consider the Council\u2019s\nexpress reference to \u201cdirect impact or consequences\u201d unremarkable in the context of\na decision concerning access. The understandable point being recorded may be\nviewed as a statement of the obvious \u2014 the grant of access to the Property at most\nwould represent a preliminary step towards mine development, with no direct impact\nduring the period of access. The matter recorded by the Council cannot reasonably be\ninterpreted as the Council excluding from its consideration others who rather than\n25 See s 5 LGA, above at [40].\nbeing affected by mining simply hold views about the industry or the issues that arise.\nThe Council\u2019s view clearly was that all such persons \u2014 whether simply interested or\ndirectly affected \u2014 would have the opportunity for their views and the impact on them\nto be taken into account during later processes.\n[98] I accept Mr Conway\u2019s submission that, in the decision-making process, it was\nclearly front of mind for councillors that the community would hold a range of views\non any coal mining that might occur in the future. None of the parties here disputes\nthe correctness of such a conclusion. In those circumstances, and having regard to the\njustifiable conclusion that the decision on the Proposal was not a \u201csignificant\ndecision\u201d, the decision to not seek community views or to enter into some other form\nof community engagement before entering an access agreement was a proper exercise\nof the discretion reserved to the Council under s 79(1) LGA on how to comply with\nss 77 and 78 LGA.\nThird ground of review \u2014 failure to consider community views as preferences\nunder s 78 LGA\nForest & Bird\u2019s pleading\n[99] Forest & Bird pleads the Council failed to ascertain or properly consider\ncommunity views, as required by s 78 LGA.\nSection 78 LGA\n[100] Section 78 LGA provides:\nCommunity views in relation to decisions\n(1) A local authority must, in the course of its decision-making process in\nrelation to a matter, give consideration to the views and preferences\nof persons likely to be affected by, or to have an interest in, the matter.\n(2) [Repealed]\n(3) A local authority is not required by this section alone to undertake any\nconsultation process or procedure.\n(4) This section is subject to section 79.26\n26 See also LGA, s 14(1)(b).\n[101] Section 79 LGA, to which s 78 is subject, identifies it is \u201cthe responsibility of\na local authority to make, in its discretion, judgments\u201d as to particular matters. Those\ninclude, under s 79(1)(a):\n79(1)(a) about how to achieve compliance with sections 77 and 78 that\nis largely in proportion to the significance of the matters\naffected by the decision as determined in accordance with the\npolicy under section 76AA; and\n[102] In his written submissions for this hearing, Mr McDonald invoked the 2009\ndecision of the Court of Appeal in Whakatane District Court v Bay of Plenty Regional\nCouncil (Whakatane).\n27\n[103] Mr McDonald initially submitted that Whakatane is authority for the\nproposition that s 78 LGA requires conscious steps to be taken by the decision-maker\nto secure information on the views and preferences of those likely to be affected in\nrelation to the proposal and an actual and intentional consideration of that information.\n(In his oral submissions Mr McDonald withdrew the qualifier \u201cconscious\u201d).\n[104] In Whakatane, the Court of Appeal (allowing an appeal from the High Court)\nset aside decisions of the Regional Council (known as Environment Bay of Plenty or\n\u201cEBOP\u201d) whereby EBOP had amended its long-term Council community plan to\npermit relocation of EBOP\u2019s head office from Whakatane to Tauranga. As found by\nthe Court of Appeal, the decision to shift the head office and many personnel from\nWhakatane to Tauranga was a \u201csignificant decision\u201d as that term is used in s 76(3)(b)\nLGA.28\n\n[105] Under s 76(1) LGA, the EBOP decision in Whakatane had to be made in\naccordance with the applicable provisions of ss 77, 78, 80, 81 and 82. Because it was\na \u201csignificant\u201d decision, the EBOP under s 76(3)(b) had to ensure, before making the\ndecision, that the s 76(1) requirements were appropriately observed.\n[106] The appeal decision in Whakatane turned in particular on whether EBOP had\n\u201cgiven consideration to the views and preferences\u201d of the relevant members of the\n27 Whakatane District Court v Bay of Plenty Regional Council [2010] NZCA 346, [2010] 3 NZLR\n826 (CA) [Whakatane] at [72]\u2013[73].\n28 Whakatane, above n 27, at [11].\ncommunity as required by s 78(1). The Court of Appeal held that EBOP had not\ncomplied with s 78, there being no evidence of actual consideration of community\nviews and preferences:29\n[72] To \u201cgive consideration to the views and preferences\u201d of the relevant\nmembers of the community is not achieved by mere knowledge of such views\nand preferences. It comprises two steps. The first is for EBOP to secure\ninformation as to such views and preferences. As a legal person it must do so\nby the conduct of natural persons which will be attributed to it by law. The\ninformation may be held by councillors; it may be held by an agent of EBOP\nholding an appropriate delegation. We accept that some information of that\nkind was held by EBOP via its councillors and perhaps via Mr Bayfield. Some\nof the information obtained by Deloitte would have informed its report and so\nbecome knowledge of EBOP.\n[73] There remains however the second step \u2013 of actually considering that\ninformation for the purposes of stages 1 and 2. The Judge considered that\ncould occur \u201caccidentally\u201d. It is not logically impossible that EBOP could\nhave \u201caccidentally\u201d done enough in its engagement with those likely to be\naffected to comply with s 78(2). But the prescriptive nature of s 78(2),\nparticularly when read with s 77, makes it inherently unlikely that there would\nbe \u201caccidental\u201d compliance. There is simply no factual basis for the\nsubmission that that occurred.\n[74] The submission that it did, like EBOP\u2019s argument that the\nconsideration of community views is to be given \u201cin the course of the\ndecision-making process\u201d and work in the various stages may overlap, fails to\nmeet the problem that it was for EBOP to show it had carried out its statutory\nobligation. No document and no other evidence was adduced to show it had\nin the course of its decision-making process in relation to the matter of siting\nthe head office, given consideration to the views and preferences of persons\nlikely to be affected by, or to have an interest in, the matter:\n(a) at the stage at which the problems and objectives related to\nthe matter are defined:\n(b) at the stage at which the options that may be reasonably\npracticable options of achieving an objective are identified:\n[75] That is the simple end of the matter.\n[107] It is to be noted that s 78(2) LGA \u2014 which mandated the staged consideration\nthe Court of Appeal was considering in Whakatane \u2014 was repealed after the decision\nin Whakatane was delivered.30\n29 Whakatane, above n 27, at [72]\u2013[74].\n30 Local Government Act 2002 Amendment Act 2010, s 9. Section 78(2) LGA previously required:\n(2) That consideration must be given at\u2014\n(a) the stage at which the problems and objectives related to the matter are defined:\n(b) the stage at which the options that may be reasonably practicable options of achieving\nan objective are identified:\n[108] The Court of Appeal revisited the operation of Pt 6 LGA in Minotaur.\n31\n The\ncase concerned judicial review of Council decisions in relation to consultation over\nparking policy \u2014 the relevant period was 2010 when the provisions of s 78(2)\n(considered in Whakatane). A landlord complained that the Council had irrationally\nfailed to consult it over the changes.\n[109] In Minotaur, the Court of Appeal rejected the concept of an obligation to\nconsult or to adopt a particular consultation process, explaining:32\n[35] Section 78(1) provides that a local authority must, in the course of its\ndecision making, give consideration to the views and preferences of persons\nlikely to be affected by, or have an interest in, the matter. Subsection (2)\nprovides that the views and preferences of affected persons or those who have\nan interest in the matter must be considered at four stated stages of decisionmaking.\n[36] Note, however, that subs (3) makes it clear that s 78 does not itself\ngenerate an obligation to consult or indeed to adopt any particular consultation\nprocess or procedure. Rather, consultation is one of a number of options for\nobtaining information about the views and preferences of those affected or\nwith an interest. Subsection (4) restates that the section is subject to the wide\nimplementation discretion in s 79.\n\u2026\n[38] The effect of this provision [s 82] is that, when a council does choose\nto consult, certain \u201cprinciples\u201d apply to the particular forms of consultation\nthe council adopts \u2026\n(footnote omitted)\nSubmissions\n[110] Forest & Bird asserts the Council did not ascertain or properly consider\ncommunity views and that, to the contrary, steps were deliberately not taken to\nascertain community views. Particular reliance was placed on the 14 April community\nview discussion (above at [12]), confirming that \u201ccommunity views have not been\nsought\u201d.\n(c) the stage at which reasonably practicable options are assessed and proposals developed:\n(d) the stage at which proposals of the kind described in paragraph (c) are adopted.\n31 Minotaur, above n 24.\n32 At [35]\u2013[36]. \n[111] For Forest & Bird, Mr McDonald invokes s 78 LGA and submits the Council\ndid not give proper consideration to the members of the community. He refers to the\nmaterial indicating the Council contemplated the possibility a significant section of\nthe community might be opposed to new coalmining using Council land. He notes the\nobservations in the Recommendation Report and the Committee Report as to\ncommunity views not being sought and there having been no specific engagement\nactivities. He notes that the Recommendation Report, in relation to Option 1 (as\nsubsequently adopted by the Council) recorded as a disadvantage of the option that it\ndid not provide time for comprehensive community engagement and consideration of\ncommunity views.\n[112] Mr McDonald referred to the Court of Appeal decision in Whakatane,\nobserving that the Court in that case had held that \u201cwhere there was no evidence\nadduced to show the necessary intention or consideration, it was \u2018the simple end of\nthe matter\u2019\u201d.33\n\n[113] For the Council, Mr Conway emphasised the nature of the Council decision\nrequired to be made, namely whether to enter into an access arrangement. For mining\nto take place, New Brighton required a suite of other approvals.\n[114] Mr Conway noted Mr Russell\u2019s evidence that at both the committee meeting\n(23 March) and the meeting of the full Council (14 April) members had discussed\nwhether or not it was necessary to gauge community views given that the Council, as\nlandowner, was simply providing access to the land (and not permission to mine).\nMr Conway noted the observations in the Recommendation Report that staff\nanticipated the community holding a wide range of views on the topic so there was a\nhigh risk that any engagement exercise would be inconclusive.\n[115] Mr Conway referred to the Council\u2019s wide implementation discretion under\ns 79 LGA and the fact that under s 78 consultation is an option for obtaining\ninformation about community views rather than an obligation \u2014 these matters having\nbeen established in the Court of Appeal\u2019s guidance in Minotaur (as set out at [109]\nabove).\n33 Whakatane, above n [27].\n[116] Mr Conway observed that the Court of Appeal decision in Whakatane was in\nrelation to a decision found to be significant (unlike the decision in this case) and that,\neven in Whakatane, the Court recognised that relevant information to community\nviews may already be held by Council, without fresh engagement activities being\nundertaken.\nDiscussion \u2014 the consideration of community views as preferences\n[117] The Council\u2019s responsibility under s 79(1) LGA was to make, in its discretion,\njudgements about how to achieve compliance with ss 77 and 78. The latter provision\nis that which requires the local authority to give consideration to the views and\npreferences of persons likely to be affected by, or to have an interest in, the matter.\nBut the judgement to be made by the Council is to be \u201clargely in proportion to the\nsignificance of the matters affected by the decision \u2026\u201d\n[118] Here the justified determination of the Council was that the Decision was not\nsignificant.\n[119] That decision flowed from the nature of the proposal, being a proposal to\naccess the Property. The conclusion reached at [95]\u2014[99] above \u2014 in relation to the\nsignificance of the Decision \u2014 applies equally here. The decision to neither seek\ncommunity views nor enter into some other form of community engagement before\nentering the access agreement was a proper exercise of the Council\u2019s discretion under\ns 79(1) LGA.\nFourth ground of review \u2014 failure to consider the scientific consensus on\nanthropogenic climate change\nForest & Bird\u2019s pleading\n[120] Forest & Bird pleads the Council erred by failing to consider the global\nscientific consensus on climate change. Related to that pleading are further pleadings\nthat the Council erred by failing to consider other relevant matters, including:\n(a) the Council\u2019s plans and policies identifying and/or recognising the\nchallenges posed by climate change;\n(b) the LGLCC Declaration;\n(c) the impact of climate change on youth and future generations, whether\nin Southland or generally; and\n(d) the interests of future as well as current communities.\nSubmissions\n[121] For Forest & Bird, Mr McDonald characterised the Decision as a decision \u201cto\nfacilitate the extraction of coal from Council land and its subsequent combustion\u201d.\nAlternatively he referred to the subject matter as being \u201cthe facilitation of coalmining\noperations and their contribution to climate change\u201d.\n[122] In its statement of claim Forest & Bird pleaded a number of matters under a\nheading \u201cScientific consensus on climate change\u201d and some further matters under a\nheading \u201cCoal\u2019s contribution to climate change\u201d, with Mr McDonald\u2019s very broad\nsummary as set out above at [35].\n[123] The Council, by its pleading, acknowledges that climate change exists, that\nenergy is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and that coal currently\nmakes up a portion of global primary energy supplier and recognises that matters\nrelating to climate change asserted by the plaintiffs represent statements made by some\nin the scientific community but otherwise (because \u201cit does not have the necessary\ntechnical expertise to plead to the matters\u201d) denies Forest & Bird\u2019s allegations on\nclimate change.\n[124] New Brighton\u2019s pleadings in this regard were similar to those of the Council.\n[125] Mr McDonald submitted the impact of the Decision on climate change was a\nrelevant consideration (to be taken into account by the Council under s 79(2) LGA)\nand that, in assessing the significance of that consideration, the Council had to consider\nthe scientific consensus on climate change. He submitted that the Council plainly did\nnot take into account the global consensus.\n[126] For the Council, Mr Conway submitted the matters of \u201cscientific consensus\u201d\npleaded by Forest & Bird are of a general nature that cannot create a legal requirement\nthat it be taken into account. He further submitted that the \u201crelevant matters\u201d to be\ntaken into account under s 79(2) LGA take their meaning from s 79(1)(a) \u2014 the\n\u201crelevant matters\u201d are a shorthand for \u201cthe matters affected by the decision as\ndetermined in accordance with the [Council\u2019s S&P Policy]\u201d.\n[127] Mr Conway submitted that it is relevant that New Zealand\u2019s response to climate\nchange, and any emissions generated from burning coal, is addressed at a national\nlevel under the Climate Change Response Act 2002.\n[128] Finally, Mr Conway rejected any suggestion the Council had failed to turn its\nmind to the issue of climate change \u2014 he referred to repeated references in the\nRecommendation Report to the climate change context, as well as the evidence of Mr\nRussell who confirmed that councillors had given consideration to climate change,\nand the coalmining industry in particular, and had discussed community views relating\nto climate change.\nDiscussion\n[129] Once the Council determined that the Proposal did not, in terms of the S&E\nPolicy, involve a \u201csignificant\u201d matter (as I have found the Council was justified in\nconcluding) the Council could not be required to bring into consideration on this\naccess issue matters that Forest & Bird (and others) may categorise as matters of\nscientific consensus on climate change. The examination of such matters and any\nattempt on the part of the Council to reach its own view on the validity of the assertions\ninvolved could reasonably be viewed by councillors as a disproportionate response to\nthe matters affected by the Decision. That decision, as s 79(1) requires, was for the\njudgement of the Council, in its discretion.\n[130] I accordingly accept the submission of Mr Conway that the manner in which\nmatters of climate change were weighed by the Council in the Decision were questions\nof merit (or, in terms of s 79(1)) judgement in the Council\u2019s discretion) for the elected\nmembers. The Council\u2019s consideration of the diversity of views that would exist,\nsupportive of coalmining on the one hand and of responding to climate change on the \nother, cannot be regarded as a failure of the Council\u2019s responsibility (under s 79 LGA)\nwhen deciding how to achieve compliance with ss 77 and 78 LGA when considering\na request for access under the CMA.\nFifth ground of review \u2014 failure to take account of Council plans and policies\nand the LGLCC Declaration\nForest & Bird\u2019s pleading\n[131] Forest & Bird pleads the Council erred by failing to consider:\n(a) the LGLCC Declaration; and\n(b) the Council\u2019s plans and policies identifying and/or recognising the\nchallenges posed by climate change.\n[132] In his written submissions, Mr McDonald identified one plan \u2014 namely the\nDistrict Plan \u2014 and one policy \u2014 namely the S&E Policy.\nSubmissions \u2014 s 80 LGA\n[133] For Forest & Bird, Mr McDonald invokes the requirement upon local\nauthorities, under s 80(1) LGA, to identify \u201cinconsistent decisions\u201d, that section\nproviding:\n(1) If a decision of a local authority is significantly inconsistent with, or\nis anticipated to have consequences that will be significantly\ninconsistent with, any policy adopted by the local authority or any\nplan required by this Act or any other enactment, the local authority\nmust, when making the decision, clearly identify\u2014\n(a) the inconsistency; and\n(b) the reasons for the inconsistency; and\n(c) any intention of the local authority to amend the policy or plan\nto accommodate the decision.\n[134] For the Council, Mr Conway noted that s 80 is an accountability provision,\nrequiring the Council to identify when it is making decisions that are significantly\ninconsistent with certain plans and policies and to state its reasons for doing so and \nany intent to alter the plan or policy accordingly (emphasis added). Mr Conway noted\nthat s 80 does not prevent inconsistent decisions, instead requiring them to be\nidentified and acknowledged.\n[135] Mr Conway observed not every previous council statement or policy position\nis the subject of s 80 \u2014 a policy to be affected must be one that has been adopted by\nthe Council and a plan to be affected must be one required by statute. Secondly, the\ninconsistency with such plan or policy has to be \u201csignificant\u201d. The s 80 identification\nof inconsistencies therefore does not apply to documents of low significance, or in the\ncontext of inconsistencies that are minor.\n[136] In Mr Conway\u2019s submission, this ground of Forest & Bird\u2019s challenge\nincorrectly treats s 80 as imposing a mandatory consideration in an administrative law\nsense whereas s 80, properly understood, imposes a reporting or acknowledgement\nrequirement on the Council that is only engaged in certain circumstances.\nDiscussion \u2014 s 80 LGA\n[137] The approach Mr Conway invites to the application of s 80 LGA is correct.\nThe focus, of s 80 is upon identification of significant inconsistencies, articulation of\nhow the inconsistency arises and whether the affected policy or plan is intended to be\namended. A breach of s 80 does not serve to invalidate the affected decision. Any\ninvalidation of the decision would have to flow from an error that goes to the vires of\nthe decision itself.\nSubmissions \u2014 LGLCC Declaration\n[138] Mr McDonald submitted that the LGLCC Declaration has \u201cmandatory\nrelevancy in the context of climate change decisions\u201d.\n[139] Mr McDonald identified that the Declaration set out seven \u201cGuiding\nPrinciples\u201d for decision-making on climate change, beginning with precaution\n(\u201cacting now to avoid the existential threat of climate change\u201d).\n[140] Mr McDonald submitted the Council acted in breach of s 80 LGA by failing to\nconsider the LGLCC Declaration and the Guiding Principles.\n[141] Mr Conway observed the Council has neither been a signatory to nor adopted\nas policy the LGLCC Declaration. As such, the Guiding Principles and other content\nof the Declaration cannot constitute a mandatory consideration although they are\nmatters that may be considered in the Council\u2019s discretion.\n[142] Additionally, Mr Conway submitted the Declaration was by its nature very\ngeneral and aspirational and has little relevance to the Decision.\nDiscussion\n[143] The LGLCC Declaration did not become a policy (let alone a plan) of the\nCouncil by signature of its Mayor. Nor has it been subsequently adopted as policy by\nthe Council itself.\n[144] Accordingly, questions of inconsistency between the Decision and the\nDeclaration do not arise under s 80 LGA.\n[145] Had the Declaration constituted a relevant policy, the situation would still have\nfailed to constitute a \u201csignificant inconsistency\u201d given that the Decision is one as to\nan agreement for access and not mining.\nSixth ground of review \u2014 legally erroneous reasoning as to a \u201closs of control\u201d\nProcess\n[146] Under s 59 CMA, Bathurst gave notice to the Council of New Brighton\u2019s\nintention to obtain an access arrangement for the purpose of exploration over the\nProperty.\n[147] In the Recommendation Report, it had been recorded that the CMA:\n\u2026 outlines a process where [New Brighton] may advance access agreement,\nif Council and [New Brighton] are unable to reach agreement, this involves \nmeasures including appointment of an arbitrator and escalation to the minister\nwhich may result in control over the issue at a local government level.\n[148] It appears to have been Forest & Bird\u2019s understanding of the CMA that the\nCouncil in fact had a veto right under the CMA, which the Council overlooked. Forest\n& Bird understood s 55 CMA prevented an arbitrator from determining an access\narrangement for exploration or mining (except in the case of petroleum) unless the\nlandowner agrees.\n[149] Section 55(1) CMA provides:\n55 Restrictions on determination of access arrangements by\narbitrators\n(1) Subject to section 66, or to any agreement between each owner and\noccupier of the land and the person desiring access, an arbitrator shall\nnot be entitled to determine an access arrangement in respect of\nprospecting or exploration for, or mining of, a mineral other than\npetroleum.\n[150] Section 66 CMA (as referred to in s 55) makes provision for a permit holder to\napply for a declaration (issued by the Governor-General) that an arbitrator may\nproceed to determine an access arrangement on the grounds of public interest.\nThrough s 66(3) it provides for steps to be taken by the Minister in this way:\n(3) If the Minister, after considering the application and the [chief\nexecutive's] report, considers that there are sufficient public interest\ngrounds to support the application, the Minister shall cause to be\nserved on the owner and occupier of the land a notice in writing of the\napplication, and of the Minister's preliminary views, and stating that\nthe owner and occupier have a period of 3 months, after the date on\nwhich the notice was served, to either\u2014\n(a) Enter into an access arrangement with the permit holder; or\n(b) Consent in writing to an arbitrator determining an access\narrangement; or\n(c) Make representations to the Minister as to why a declaration\nshould not be made under this section.\n[151] Section 66(5) then provides for the making of an Order in Council for a\ndeclaration that the access arrangement may be determined by an arbitrator. By\nsubs (6) it is then provided:\n(6) A consent given or declaration made under this section shall entitle an\narbitrator to proceed to determine an access arrangement between the\napplicant under this section and the owner and occupier of the land\nconcerned; and any such arrangement shall be effective in respect of\nthe land to which it relates.\nMr Russell\u2019s evidence\n[152] Mr Russell deposed that, having regard to the access mechanism under the\nCMA, elected members expressed their concern that, if the decision-making process\nwere left to an arbitrator, the Council would lose the ability to ensure community views\nwere attained for a notified resource consent process.\n[153] That discussion led to the Council Resolution (e), as set out at [20] above.\nSubmissions\n[154] Mr McDonald submitted, by reference to s 55 CMA, the Council had\noverlooked a veto right it holds under the CMA.\nDiscussion\n[155] As submitted by Mr Conway, there is no right of veto in s 55 CMA, because\ns 55 is subject to the declaration procedure made available under s 66. While the\nconcept of \u201cpublic interest grounds\u201d sufficient to support an application under s 66 is\nlikely to substantially restrict the prospect of successful applications under that\nsection, the councillors (contrary to Forest & Bird\u2019s contention) were correct when\nthey did not regard the Council as having an (absolute) right of veto over the access\ndecision.\nSeventh ground of review \u2014 legally erroneous reasoning through Council\u2019s\nfailure to inform itself\nIntroduction\n[156] This ground of review \u2014 an alleged failure by the Council to identify and\naccept material relating to climate change issues \u2014 is closely related to the third\nground (failure to consider the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change)\n(above from [120]).\nForest & Bird\u2019s contention\n[157] Although not expressly pleaded, Forest & Bird (through Mr McDonald\u2019s\nsubmissions) contended the Council had failed to take reasonable steps to ascertain\nthe facts and circumstances relevant to the Decision.\n34 Mr Russell\u2019s evidence was that,\nduring the 14 April 2021 meeting, councillors observed that the alternative to mining\ncleaner coal in New Zealand was to import \u201cdirty\u201d coal from overseas, with no viable\nalternative in New Zealand\u2019s energy mixed coal at that stage.\n[158] Mr McDonald \u201csubmitted\u201d that the evidence of Professor Sims (summarised\nat [36](e) above) negates the suggestion there is any product that can be defined as\n\u201cclean coal\u201d.\nSubmissions\n[159] Mr McDonald submitted that, had the Council taken proper steps to inform\nitself (in relation to climate change and coalmining issues), the Decision may well\nhave been different.\n[160] Mr Conway noted the jurisdictional difficulty with asking this Court to make\nfindings of fact in a judicial review context or asking the Court to conclude that the\nCouncil should have placed more weight on certain facts. Mr Conway also referred\nto aspects of Professor Sim\u2019s evidence in more detail, making observations as to what\nis not stated in the evidence (such as the relative carbon content of the Southland coal\nresource as opposed to an imported alternative).\nDiscussion\n[161] As in relation to the earlier discussion (above from [94]), it is key background\nthat the Council had determined under its S&E Policy the Decision was not\n\u201csignificant\u201d. The Council recognised the diversity of views that the community\nwould hold relating to climate change and the potential contribution (of mining and\nsubsequent burning) of coal to climate change. In that context it was open to\n34 Citing Taylor v Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections [2015] NZCA 477, [2015]\nNZAR 1648 at [94].\ncouncillors to turn their minds to the trade-off between locally sourced and imported\ncoal. Having recognised that issues of that nature existed, it was reasonably open to\nthe Council (in relation to an access decision that did not reach the \u201csignificant\u201d\nthreshold) to decide that the appropriate time to obtain community views (and any\nfurther information) was in any resource consenting process when the actual extraction\nof coal would be considered.\nSecond cause of action \u2013 unreasonableness\nForest & Bird\u2019s pleading\n[162] Forest & Bird pleaded:\nBy making the Decision the [Council] acted unreasonably in that it is\nunreasonable to facilitate the expansion of coalmining operations in the\nDistrict in view of:\n(a) The global consensus on anthropogenic climate change and the urgent\nneed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions;\n(b) The effects and predicted effects of climate change on the District and\nits current and future community;\n(c) The contribution that the further extraction of coal will make to\nclimate change.\nUnreasonableness as a ground of review\n[163] The Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment in Wellington City Council v Woolworths New\nZealand Ltd (No 2) (Woolworths) identifies when administrative decisions may be\ninvalidated as \u201cunreasonable\u201d.35\n Richardson P, delivering the judgment of a full court,\nobserved:36\nFor the ultimate decisions to be invalidated as \u201cunreasonable\u201d, to repeat\nexpressions used in the cases, they must be so \u201cperverse\u201d, \u201cabsurd\u201d or\n\u201coutrageous in [their] defiance of logic\u201d that Parliament could not have\ncontemplated such decisions being made by an elected council.\n[164] A different formulation, to the same effect, is that of Palmer J in Hu v\nImmigration and Protection Tribunal.37\n There his Honour observed:\n35 Wellington City Council v Woolworths New Zealand Ltd (No 2) [1996] 2 NZLR 537.\n36 At 552.\n37 Hu v Immigration and Protection Tribunal [2017] NZHC 41, [2017] NZAR 508 at [2].\nWhere a decision is so insupportable or untenable that proper application of\nthe law requires a different answer, it is unlawful because it is unreasonable.\nThat may involve the adequacy of the evidential foundation of a decision or\nthe chain of logical reasoning in the application of the law to the facts.\nUnremarkably, unreasonableness, also termed irrationality, is to be found in\nthe reasoning supporting a public decision.\n[165] This formulation of the test for unreasonableness has recently been endorsed\nby the Court of Appeal in CP Group Ltd v Auckland Council.\n38\n[166] As further observed by Palmer J in Hu, three scenarios assist in identifying\nwhat amounts to an \u201cinsupportable or untenable\u201d ultimate conclusion:39\n(a) if the decision is not supported by any evidence;\n(b) if the evidence is inconsistent with or contradictory to the decision; or\n(c) if the only reasonable conclusion contradicts the decision (where there\nis \u201ca material disconnect in the chain of logic from a fact or a legal\nproposition to a conclusion, a decision may be unreasonable and\ntherefore unlawful\u201d.\nSubmissions\n[167] Mr McDonald submitted the only reasonable conclusion available to the\nCouncil in this case contradicted the decision to enter into an access agreement. He\nsubmitted that the decision in this case was \u201cpatently a perverse one\u201d.\n[168] For these propositions Mr McDonald fell back on the matters relied upon in\nrelation to earlier grounds \u2014 the statutory function of the Council to promote the four\nwellbeings; the \u201cglobal scientific consensus\u201d on anthropogenic climate change and the\nproposition the Council, by granting access, is \u201cactively facilitate new coalmining\noperations\u201d in confliction with the notion of phasing down the use of coal.\n38 CP Group Ltd v Auckland Council [2021] NZCA 587 at [135].\n39 Hu, above n 37, at [30], citing Edwards v Bairstow [1956] AC 14 (HL).\n[169] In response, Mr Conway referred to s 12(2) LGA as the source of the Council\u2019s\ngeneral power of competence, balanced by the purpose of local government set out in\ns 10, its role in s 11 and the rights and powers conferred by any other enactment. The\neffect of s 12(2)\u2014(5), within these constraints, means that a local authority has full\ncapacity to do anything a body corporate may do so long as:\n(a) it is for the purposes of performing its statutory role;\n(b) it is wholly or principally for the benefit of its district or region; and\n(c) it is not contrary to the LGA, any other Act or the general law.\n[170] In this case, the context is the Council was managing its commercial forest\nportfolio. As a forest owner, the Council had the discretion provided by Parliament\nunder the CMA to enter into an access arrangement with the holder of a CMA permit\nunder the CMA.\n[171] Mr Conway submitted the Council\u2019s entry into such arrangement does not fall\nwithin any of the tests identified by the Court of Appeal in Woolworths \u2014 \u201cperverse\u201d,\n\u201cabsurd\u201d, or \u201coutrageous in defiance of logic\u201d.\nDiscussion\n[172] The decision for the Council in this case, arising under the CMA, was whether\nor not to enter into an access arrangement.\n[173] The concerns raised by Forest & Bird as to climate change implications, central\nto its earlier grounds of review, are equally central on this final ground of review.\nWhile Forest & Bird and a significant portion of the Southland community may quite\nreasonably wish to be heard on steps that may lead to coalmining, there was nothing\nin the Council\u2019s approach to the access decision that reaches the stringent test of\nunreasonableness. It was reasonable, in reaching the access decision, that the Council\nhave regard to the fact there would be later opportunities for consultation and input at\nthe point when the actual extraction of coal was for consideration. It was reasonable\nfor the Council to effectively defer any consideration of climate change matters at a \npoint when the level of consultation and factual enquiry would have become more\nproportionate to the subject matter (that is to the issue of whether extraction of coal\nshould occur rather than to the issue of whether the holder of a CMA permit might\nhave access to the Council\u2019s land.\n[174] Significantly Forest & Bird\u2019s allegation that the Council acted unreasonably is\nexpressly premised on the basis that the Council unreasonably \u201cfacilitated the\nexpansion of coalmining operations in the District\u201d. There is a material difference\nbetween facilitation \u2014 that is making something easier \u2014 and approving or giving\nthat thing a \u201clegal go-ahead\u201d. It is clear from the record that councillors appreciated\nthey were not giving \u201cthe expansion of coalmining operations in the District\u201d the legal\ngo-ahead. The Council focused, in accordance with the scheme of the CMA, on the\naccess arrangement being requested by New Brighton under the CMA. While it may\nbe semantically correct to describe an access arrangement as something that\n\u201cfacilitates\u201d a subsequent expansion of coalmining, it is fundamentally important to\nconsidering the reasonableness of the Council\u2019s approach that the Council, by agreeing\nto enter into an access arrangement, was not approving the expansion of coalmining.\n[175] There was a distinct logic to the Council\u2019s approach in reaching the Decision.\nThe Decision falls well short of being \u201cperverse\u201d or \u201cabsurd\u201d.\nOutcome on Forest & Bird\u2019s grounds of review\n[176] None of Forest & Bird\u2019s grounds of review has been upheld. The application\nfor review will accordingly be dismissed.\nNew Brighton\u2019s affirmative defences\n[177] New Brighton pleaded two affirmative defences, as summarised at [38] above.\nMr Gordon presented detailed submissions in relation to each of those affirmative\ndefences (in addition to his submissions directly in response to Forest & Bird\u2019s pleaded\ngrounds of review).\n[178] Given the findings already made in this judgment, it is unnecessary that I rule\non the affirmative defences.\nCosts\n[179] I reserve the costs and disbursements of the proceeding. In the event counsel\nare unable to agree, costs will be determined on written submissions (four-page limit),\ncounsel for the respondents to file and serve within ten working days after this\njudgment and counsel for the applicant to file and serve within five working days\nthereafter. In the event no memoranda are filed within those time limits, the order of\nthe Court (without further order) will be that the applicant is to pay to each of the\nrespondents costs on a 2B basis together with their reasonable disbursements to be\napproved by the Registrar.\nOrders\n[180] I order:\n(a) the strike out application is dismissed;\n(b) the application for review is dismissed; and\n(c) costs and disbursements are reserved.\nOsborne J\nSolicitors:\nLee Salmon Long, Auckland\nSimpson Grierson, Auckland\nMinter Ellison Rudd Watts, Wellington"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**Summary:**\n\nThe Royal Forest & Bird Protection Society of New Zealand Inc (Forest & Bird) filed for judicial review against the Southland District Council (the Council) regarding the Council's decision to:\n\n1.
